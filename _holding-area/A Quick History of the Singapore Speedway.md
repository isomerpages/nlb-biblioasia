<h3>The history of the Singapore Speedway was as fast and furious as the races it hosted.</h3><p>By Yap Jo Lin</p><p></p><p>Before the bright lights, glitz, glamour and celebrity of the Formula One Singapore Night Race, there was the Singapore Grand Prix (which started in 1961). But 30 years before that, speedsters and curious locals alike were privy to the thrills and spills of motorcycle racing at a specially constructed dirt track called the Singapore Speedway.</p><p>The Speedway had a very short life. It hosted just six races from April to June 1930 before its closure, but it marks an interesting and important chapter of Singapore’s motor-racing history. It was located at Alkaff Avenue, near the junction of Macpherson and Upper Serangoon roads, roughly where Sennett Estate is today,<a href="#_ftn1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[^1]</a> and next to Alkaff Lake Gardens, which had opened a year earlier in 1929.</p><p>News of the Speedway first broke on 3 December 1928, when the <em>Straits Times</em> reported that Australian promoter F. Heron Pitcher was in town to set up a company to run the Speedway, and that efforts were underway to identify a site.<a href="#_ftn2" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[^2]</a> Pitcher claimed to have “ample evidence” that dirt track racing would have wide and universal appeal in Singapore. “… I have no doubt that once the people see the races they will want more,” he said. “Besides having some of the greatest experts of the dirt track in the world performing on the Singapore track, opportunities will be given for local amateurs and professionals to race, for which trophies and cash prizes will be given.”<a href="#_ftn3" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[^3]</a></p><p>In the months leading up to the Speedway’s debut, another Australian came on board as managing director – a Mr. A. J. Reynolds, whose last stint was as an advertising manager for Western Australia Speedways Ltd.<a href="#_ftn4" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[^4]</a> Reynolds came to Singapore with almost three decades of experience in the entertainment and sports industries under his belt. Reynolds had a colourful past. When he was 15, Reynolds joined a troupe of acrobats touring Australia. He eventually left the troupe and received some technical training on the applications of electricity in commerce. He managed a few cinemas and several racetracks in Australia before turning his attention to racing in Singapore.<a href="#_ftn5" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[^5]</a></p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Online Only Articles/Singapore Speedway/1_A_J_Reynolds.jpg"></div><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><br></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><hr><p><a href="#_ftnref1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[1]</a> Location derived from comparison of Survey Department, Singapore, <em><a href="https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/maps_building_plans/record-details/f8feb2b0-115c-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Survey Map of Singapore</a></em>, 1933, map.
