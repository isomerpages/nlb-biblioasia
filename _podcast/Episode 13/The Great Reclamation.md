[*The Great Reclamation*](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=206018224) is a work of historical fiction set in Singapore that has received rave reviews from the New Yorker and the New York Times. A love story, it also took five years of serious research into a variety of topics, including land reclamation, the Japanese occupation, and postwar politics in Singapore. Listen to author Rachel Heng talk about her book and her fascinating research process, including a BiblioAsia article on [land reclamation](/vol-13/issue-1/apr-jun-2017/land-from-sand/) she referred to!
