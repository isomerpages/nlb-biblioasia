#### **Zinnurain Nasir**  and **Nasri Shah** shed light on the Banjar people, a small but significant sub-ethnic Malay community from South Kalimantan.

“Haram manyarah waja sampai kaputing” is a traditional idiom in *basa* Banjar or Banjarese, the native language of the Banjar people (Urang Banjar)[^1] who originally hailed from South Kalimantan on the island of Borneo. 

Literally translated as “Let not the steel (of a blade) stop short until its very point”, the idiom’s imagery of steel and blade recalls the Banjar community’s martial history, beginning with the local sultanate’s skirmishes with Dutch and British traders in the 17th century right up to the Banjarmasin War of 1859.[^2 ]

In the context of modern Singapore, the phrase is about persistence, about never giving up. In the words of former Malay-language teacher and a Banjar, Mohd Gazali bin Mohd Arshad, whose uncle Haji Mohamed Sanusi was the first Mufti of Singapore and also a Banjar, “… haram manyarah waja sampai kaputing. If we [are] to do anything, let us do it well… achieve and complete it well”. The idiom continues to be upheld today by the Banjar communities in cities such as Banjarmasin (now the capital city of South Kalimantan) and Martapura. 

This idiom also greeted visitors to the “Urang Banjar: Heritage and Culture of the Banjar in Singapore” exhibition held at the Malay Heritage Centre from 28 November 2020 to 25 July 2021.[^3] The exhibition the many ways in which the Banjar culture had been adapted and localised since the arrival of the first Banjar people to Singapore in the 19th century, including the importance of the idiom as a rallying call for the community. 

The Banjar community is one of the smallest sub-ethnic Malay communities in Singapore. In the 1990 Census of Singapore, only 12 people identified themselves as Banjarese.[^4] (Since then, the census has stopped publishing the numbers for sub-ethnic groups so updated figures are not available.)

What is believed to be the first documented count of the Banjarese community in Singapore dates to the 1911 *Report on the Census of the Colony of the Straits Settlements*. The census recorded that there were 377 Banjar individuals here, about 0.64 percent of the total population of Malays at the time.

But despite their increasingly small numbers, the Urang Banjar of Singapore is a tight-knit community. And the idiom functions as more than just a reminder of a war fought by their forefathers in Borneo in the 19th century. In the 21st century, this idiom exhorts the community to band together and forge ahead towards the future. 

##### **Pioneering Migrants**

Members of the Banjar community in Singapore are able to trace their lineage to traders, diamond merchants, businessmen and travellers who arrived here from South Kalimantan via overland routes in the Malay Peninsula or by sea from as early as the beginning of the 19th century.

“Merantau” encapsulates the reasons and motivations behind migration within the Malay world, from the early groups of sojourners since ancient times to present-day travellers. The term is traditionally associated with the Minangkabau community of West Sumatra, whose matrilineal practices have often prompted young men to seek subsistence and fortune in other lands. However, ”merantau” has also become a common practice and way of life for other communities and sub-ethnic groups in the Malay world, including the Urang Banjar.

From Landak and Pontianak in West Kalimantan to Perak and Batu Pahat in the Malaya Peninsula as well as to Singapore, these places are just some of several towns and cities that the Banjar community migrated to for various reasons. The first large-scale wave of migration is thought to have occurred in the 1780s. People moved from Banjarmasin to Sumatra as a result of conflict between the sultan at the time, Sunan Nata Alam, and a prince named Pangeran Amir.5 A little less than a century later, the outbreak of the Banjarmasin War prompted a further exodus of the Banjar people to Malaya and Singapore. 

But the story of migration of the Banjar community across the Malay Archipelago is framed not only in terms of conflict, but also in search of new opportunities and life experiences. The numerous towns and cities in the Malay world afforded these migratory Banjar many options, and it was just a matter of deciding which locale would best suit their needs. True to the aforementioned Banjar idiom, conflict and crisis failed to dampen the Banjar community’s spirit and resolve in persevering till the end (“waja sampai kaputing”). 

The Banjar with ties to royalty and the nobility as well as those with links to the diamond industry, such as diamond traders and merchants, flocked to Landak in West Kalimantan which had built up a reputation as a diamond mining district from the 18th century. By 1858, the diamond trade in Landak was predominantly in the hands of the Banjar community. 

The Banjar people also regarded Landak as a safe haven since the Landak Sultanate was allied with the Sultanate of Banjar. The increasing Dutch presence in South Kalimantan, coupled with the Banjarmasin War and the subsequent abolition of the Banjarmasin sultanate in 1860, prompted a wave of migration.

Perak, on the west coast of the Malay Peninsula, was another destination that the Bajar people moved to.6 The state had fertile grounds similar to the lands surrounding the Barito River in South Kalimantan. The flooding which occurred around the Barito River area in the late 1880s prompted a mass movement of the Banjar people to Krian in the northwestern corner of Perak. 

These migratory and settlement patterns would be replicated when the Urang Banjar migrated to Singapore. In 1824, the Dutch colonial government re-established Banjarmasin as a free port, which meant that cargo ships could ply routes to non-Dutch-controlled ports, including Singapore.7 Trade between both cities primarily consisted of textiles, including muslins, gurrahs and blatchu cloth, among others.8 

Some of the earliest documented Banjar merchants emigrated to Singapore in the mid-to late-19th century, including Haji Mahmood bin Abdul Rahim and Haji Osman bin Haji Abu Naim, who became successful diamond traders and prominent members of the local Banjar community. Haji Mahmood owned a large house spanning Lorong 18 Geylang and Lorong 20 Geylang, one of several abodes reserved for his large family of three wives and 18 children.9 

By the turn of the 20th century, passenger ships began to ply more regularly between Singapore and Banjarmasin, indicating a high demand for travel to these two places. In 1907, shipping companies were advertising first-class passenger routes from Singapore to Banjarmasin.10 

Due to the ease of travelling between the two cities, more Banjar people began arriving and they soon established a small but significant presence in the local Singapore landscape.
