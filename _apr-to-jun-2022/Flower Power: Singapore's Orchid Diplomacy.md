In August 2021, during a visit to Singapore, United States Vice President Kamala Harris was welcomed to the Istana by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. As a welcome gift, she was presented with a spray of purplish-pink orchids named after her, the Papilionanda Kamala Harris (Vanda Kulwadee Fragrance × Papilionanthe hookeriana).[^1]

Whenever world leaders visit a foreign country in an official capacity, they are usually given tokens of appreciation and enjoy tours of the country’s attractions. In Singapore, however, some receive something special – an orchid hybrid named after them. This initiative – known as “orchid diplomacy” – serves as a gesture of friendship to promote goodwill between Singapore and other countries and plays an important role in building bilateral ties, as it is accorded to dignitaries such as royalty, heads of state and heads of government.[^2]

Why orchids specifically? And why hybrids? Orchids, which belong to the family Orchidaceae, are chosen for their vibrant colours, hardiness and resilience. They help to project a strong image of Singapore. Hybrids, created by crossing two different breeds of parent plant species, reflect Singapore’s multicultural heritage and globally oriented outlook.[^3] The parent plants may even be hybrids themselves. 

Selected orchid hybrids are named after visiting heads of state and heads of government as well as celebrities and important guests to the Singapore Botanic Gardens.[^4] This tradition dates back to 1956, and today there are over 200 of such orchids in the National Orchid Garden at the Singapore Botanic Gardens.[^5] VIP orchids, including those named in honour of the wives of heads of state and heads of government, are housed in the VIP Orchid Garden, while celebrity orchids can be viewed at the Celebrity Orchid Garden. 

The first VIP orchid is the Aranthera Anne Black (Arachnis Maggie Oei × Renanthera coccinea), named after Lady Anne Black in 1956. She was the wife of Robert Black, a former governor of Singapore.[^6] This hybrid makes a good cut flower as older flowers in a spray do not wither when new ones bloom. Following independence in 1965, Singapore formalised the procedures for the naming of VIP orchids.

#### **Cultivating Orchid Hybrids**

The creation of orchid hybrids is undertaken by the Orchid Hybridisation Programme managed by the Singapore Botanic Gardens.[^7] Various characteristics are taken into consideration when hybridising orchids, such as large and long-lasting flowers, high flower count, good arrangement of sprays, and the “look” of something new. However, not all crosses succeed due to factors like infertile parent plants or rot in the seed pods.[^8]

The hybrid breeding process entails five steps: (1) deciding the type of orchid hybrid and then searching for the “parents” with the right characteristics; (2) transferring the pollen from the male parent to the female parent for fertilisation; (3) sowing the orchid seeds in a culture medium containing nutrients so that the seeds can germinate and grow into seedlings; (4) growing the seedlings in flasks for six to 12 months before they are transferred to pots in a nursery; and (5) waiting for the plants to flower, which usually takes two to three years of growing the orchids in pots.[^9]

According to Peggy Tan, former president of the Orchid Society of South East Asia, a toothpick is used to harvest the pollen from a flower, which is immediately placed onto the stigma of another flower. If pollination succeeds, the flower will fade but remains on the stem until a seed pod develops several weeks later. However, if an orchid’s resultant flowers are defective, then the plant may be discarded.[^10]

Yam Tin Wing, senior researcher of orchid breeding at the Singapore Botanic Gardens, noted in 2009 that only 10 percent of orchid hybrids were found “suitable to be used in orchid-naming ceremonies”. “It’s like waiting for a baby to be born,” he said. “You don’t know what it will look like, or the characteristics it will have. Some orchids may look good, but are weak plants. Others may grow well but not have any flowers.”[^11] 

Orchid hybrids take anywhere between two and six years to flower from the day the parents are crossed. For example, the Aranda Lee Kuan Yew (Arachnis hookeriana × Vanda Golden Moon), named after Singapore’s founding prime minister when he passed away in 2015, took four years to bloom after its parents were crossed.[^12]

To ensure there are always orchid hybrids (“Very Important Plants”) available for naming after VIPs, the Botanic Gardens stores hundreds of hybrids that have bloomed but remain unnamed.[^13] According to a Straits Times report in 1984, some orchids “may bloom in obscurity for as much as a decade before getting a name – as they flower at a time when no celebrity is visiting. But a lucky few are christened in their first bloom”.[^14]

To conserve the VIP orchid collections, these orchids are sent to the Gardens’ Micropropagation Laboratory for mass propagation, and subsequently to the National Orchid Garden’s nursery to be nurtured till they flower. These flowering plants are then used for displays and further propagation when stocks are low.[^15]

#### **Selecting VIP Orchids**

Several months before a notable dignitary is set to visit Singapore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) provides the Singapore Botanic Gardens with a dossier on the visitor.  Based on the information, several orchids are shortlisted. The recommendations are then sent to the MFA and the visiting dignitary’s representatives.[^16] Simon Tan, Assistant Director of the National Orchid Garden, commented in 2015 that “the MFA advises [the garden] on taboo colours” and preferred colours. The Singapore Botanic Gardens will then choose the orchids according to these requirements.[^17]

Much care is also taken in selecting an orchid that befits the dignitary it will be named after. For example, the Paravanda Nelson Mandela (Papilionanda Mas Los Angeles × Paraphalaenopsis labukensis), named in honour of the anti-apartheid leader and president of South Africa when he visited Singapore in March 1997, has “a bright greenish-yellow hue with a reddish tinge, resembling the colours of the South African flag”. It won the second prize at the 18th World Orchid Conference held in France in March 2005.[^18]

Another example is the Dendrobium Memoria Princess Diana (Dendrobium Pattaya Beauty × Dendrobium Fairy Wong), christened on 22 September 1997, a month after Princess Diana’s death.[^19] Yam noted that the orchid was white, a “very regal or royal colour” that also reflected the late Princess of Wales’ efforts to promote peace, such as by banning land mines. He added that the flower “has a tinge of pink on its petals which make it seem warm and approachable, just like the personality of the Princess”.[^20]

In yet another example, the orchids Aranda Lee Kuan Yew and Vanda Kwa Geok Choo (Vanda Amelita Ramos × Vanda Harvest Time) – named after the founding prime minister and his wife – were chosen to match in terms of colour, form and stature. They also share common species in their lineages.[^21]

Said then Minister for National Development Khaw Boon Wan in a blog post on 24 March 2015: “For some time, we have been looking out for a suitable orchid hybrid to name after Mr Lee. NParks [National Parks Board] officers who have staffed him on his many visits to the SBG [Singapore Botanic Gardens] have a good sense of what he enjoyed and liked amongst the flora and fauna.”[^22]

VIPs may also have a say in which orchid is named after them. Then British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher personally selected her orchid, the Dendrobium Margaret Thatcher (Dendrobium Concham × Dendrobium lasianthera), during her visit to Singapore in April 1985. Chua Sian Eng, Commissioner of Parks and Recreation, explained to Mrs Thatcher that “the orchid was chosen for its vigour and growth”. Sporting petals that resemble antelope horns, the orchid won three prizes at the Singapore Orchid Show in 1987.[^23]

When Japan’s Crown Prince Naruhito (now Emperor) wed Masako Owada in June 1993, then President of Singapore Wee Kim Wee presented the royal couple with an orchid that had been specially flown to Tokyo to commemorate the wedding. This was a white orchid, the Dendrobium Masako Kotaishi Hidenka (also known as Dendrobium Her Imperial Highness the Crown Princess Masako; Dendrobium Singa Snow × Dendrobium Subang). The crown princess had selected this particular hybrid after viewing photos of different orchids.[^24]

Once an orchid is named, it is registered with the Royal Horticultural Society in London, the international registration authority for orchid hybrids. VIPs are presented with the orchid’s official birth certificate – with details such as the hybrid’s parents, appearance, date of pollination and flowering – and in some cases they get to keep the orchid too.[^25]

If the VIPs wish to grow their namesake orchid in their home country, the Singapore Botanic Gardens will provide them with the orchid plant cutting with flower stalks, accompanied by instructions on how to care for the orchid. The plant cutting is cushioned and secured in a box, and the flowers are wrapped. The Singapore Botanic Gardens also ensures that any plant import documents requested by the VIP’s home country are complete and in good order.[^26]

After being presented with their namesake orchids, dignitaries may go on to view other VIP orchids of significance to them. Following the unveiling of the Vanda William Catherine (Vanda First and Last × Vanda Motes Toledo Blue), Britain’s Prince William and Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, viewed the Dendrobium Elizabeth (Dendrobium Mustard × Dendrobium Noor Aishah; Noor Aishah is the wife of Singapore’s first president, Yusof
