Water has and will always be a precious resource in Singapore. In 2015, the Washington-based World Resources Institute identified the city-state as one of 33 out of 167 countries most likely to face extremely high water stress by 2040.1 To help overcome the absence of natural water bodies, the government has come up with innovative ways to expand and diversify Singapore’s water resources. 

Over the decades, PUB, Singapore’s national water agency, has created a sustainable supply from four sources: water from local catchment, imported water, high-grade reclaimed water (known as NEWater) and desalinated water.2 Together, these four sources, termed the “Four National Taps”, have come a long way in helping Singapore meet its water needs.
