#### **Introduction: The Machine Age**
The introduction of mechanised accounting machines in the late 19th century marked a radical break from manual accounting practices. Ranging from punch card readers to cash registers,[^1] these accounting machines were the ancestors of the modern computer, and constituted a crucial transition stage in Malaya’s technological history.[^2]

From the 1930s to the 1960s, the accounting machine industry in Malaya was dominated by three multinationals, namely the British-based International Computers and Tabulators (ICT) and its American counterparts, National Cash Register (NCR) and International Business Machines (IBM).[^3] Each of these companies will be examined from three angles: the introduction of their machines, their impact in commerce and
government administration, and their employment and representation
of women. Collectively, a study of these trends helps to reveal Malaya’s
otherwise buried computer proto-history, including a group of unsung
pioneers: women operators.

This paper attempts to construct a subaltern gender narrative from
the dominant masculinist and Eurocentric infrastructure of transnational
corporations, government institutions and commercial media in the first
half of the 20th century. Women may have been the first generation of
operators, but in official documents and media reports, they were often
marginalised. For example, their non-involvement in technological
developments was assumed in a Straits Budget report on a talk on post office
accounts in 1937: “bookkeeping machines and other electronic accounting
devices were demonstrated to the audience, which included non-accountants
and women”.[^4] In published reports, except for a few European women
supervisors, the women were nameless. In official photographs, women
operators were mostly shown with their backs to the camera or looking
away. Such peripheral representations reflected the perceived status of
these women operators as the “data proletariat” in a male-led industry.
Through assembling these otherwise fragmentary references and images,
the three case studies in this paper make possible a more coherent narrative
of women’s pioneering participation in Malaya’s data mechanisation and
computerisation journey.

#### **“Clever Girls” with the “Queerest Jobs in Town”: The Women Operators of ICT’s Powers-Samas**

The first public mention of modern accounting machines came in the 1920s.
In 1922, replying to open criticisms of the administrative inadequacies of
the Municipality of Singapore by its contracted accountant Major Gooding
Field, the Municipal Commission asserted that “cash registers, Burroughs
Machines, Amco Adders and Merchant Calculators are in daily use in the
Municipal Offices”.[^5] A decade later, recognising that the bigger and more
sophisticated punch card readers could compile and sort larger volumes of data, the Registrar General announced his intention to purchase the “most
modern accounting machines”.[^6] Official records from 1935 show the purchase
and installation of a set of mechanised accounting machines for 32,048.07
Straits dollars, together with punch cards (an annually recurring purchase)
for 1,783.04 Straits dollars.[^7] A few years later, a new system was installed; the
machines were considered a marvel:

  Special cards are punched for each consumer, showing<br> 
  consumer names and addresses together with their dealings<br>
  with the department. These are automatically sorted and 
		 then<br>
  run through a tabulating machine which prints the bills, with<br>
  duplicates which are bound to form a ledger.[^8]

At that point in the late 1930s, 2,000 out of 40,000 of the Municipal
accounts had been mechanised; a full changeover was expected to be
completed within a year.[^9]
This initiative was disrupted by the Second World War, and the system
reportedly suffered from neglect during the Japanese Occupation (1942–45).[^10]
After the war, the machines were in poor condition. Data collected for the
1947 Pan-Malayan Census had to be reconfigured in Ipoh and sent to be
tabulated by the British Tabulating Machine Company in Britain under
the control of the Treasury, with the Malayan authorities bearing the
cost.[^11] By 1950, the colony had received a consignment of 15 new machines, valued at £12,000, from the United Kingdom.[^12] These were to be used –
initially alongside their reconditioned older counterparts – to process trade,
financial, salary and demographic statistics.[^13]

The new accounting machines were from the Powers-Samas
organisation, which was part of the Vickers group of companies that was
expanding its operations in Asia through its district office in Calcutta, with
a sales and technical service office in Singapore under Henry Waugh and
Co. Ltd.[^14] Following the merger with British Tabulating Machine to form
International Computers and Tabulators (ICT) in 1959, the organisation
was further committed to the region. In August 1964, ICT installed the
Federation of Malaysia’s fourth computer – an ICT 1301 system – in the
Public Utilities Board at Singapore’s City Hall, starting the transition out of
the old punch card system to a more automated computerised system.[^15]

From the start, the accounting machines did not just facilitate
bookkeeping and reports, but also provided new employment opportunities,
particularly for women. The participation of this new labour force was
initially not welcomed. In 1932, the <i>Singapore Free Press</i> reported on plans
to install the Powers-Samas machines in three years’ time. The paper’s
comments reflected an underlying anxiety over the accounting machines,
and their women operators:

  It is understood that a proposal has been made to the Crown<br>
  agents to send out about twenty girls with accounting machines<br>
  for the Accounts Department of the F.M.S. [Federated Malay<br>
  States] Railways. The idea, apparently, is to do away with the<br>
  majority of the present staff and train girls for employment.[^16]

Nonetheless, the employment of women proceeded as planned. The
Asian women operators, known as clerk-operators, were supervised by Mrs
Marjorie Ainger, a European.[^17] Ainger was the section supervisor from 1935
to 1952, and her principal task was generating the monthly Malayan statistics
report.[^18] Given the general absence of women in public institutions in
1930s Singapore, the mention of Ainger in not only official reports but also
newspaper accounts shows the novelty of women in administrative positions.

One of the department’s productions, prepared with the aid of
accounting machines, was the  <i> Malayan Statistics of Imports and Exports </i> , a
500-page volume with detailed data on diverse categories of transactions.
In the 1950s, the machines were operated by 13 women clerk-operators
processing close to 50,000 cards each month at a rate of 3,000 cards per
hour as part of unit “accounting”.[^19] As the  <i> Singapore Free Press </i>  reported,

  Surrounded by an array of intricate electrical machines and 
<br>   working to the accompaniment of weird-pitched, high
<br>  sounding clicking noises all day long, these girls do perhaps one<br>  of the queerest jobs in town. But, their job is not only queer; it<br>  is highly responsible.[^20]
		 
	
The belief was that women were temperamentally more suitable than
men as clerk-operators.[^21]	 

An insight into the early operations of the Powers-Samas accounting
machines at the Federated Malay States Railways (FMSR) offices was
documented by the Kuala Lumpur correspondent of the <i>Straits Times</i> in 1935.  Consisting of five key punching machines, a sorter and a tabulator, the
installation was operated by a staff of locally recruited women whom the
paper described as “clever girls” who had attained considerable “skill and
speed” with only a month’s training. The process generated statistics such
as engine types, wagon miles, cargo weight, distance travelled, punctuality,
performance, journeys taken by passengers, and storage of goods.

Figure 1 offers a glimpse of the operations of the Powers-Samas
accounting machines at the Singapore Statistics Department, which appears
to have been staffed entirely by women. In the photo, two operators, with
their backs to the camera, have their hands pressed against the machines as
they look intently at the paper reels in front of them. Facing them are two
other women focused on their machines. Owing to their being featured
in local newspaper stories for their work in compiling census data, women
became increasingly associated with mechanised data processing in the 1950s
and 1960s.[^22]

The supervisory roles in such departments were dominated by European
women, even into the 1960s. Like her predecessor Ainger, Joan Talalla
started with the Department of Statistics after the Second World War, with
20 non-European operators of accounting machines under her. By 1960, the
number had grown to 85, constituting the biggest all-women section within
the government.[^23]

The perception of locals being sidelined by colonial racial hierarchies
did not go unchallenged, with the tensions being part of the acrimonious
industrial relations in Singapore in the 1950s and 1960s. ICT became one
of the battlegrounds. On 20 December 1961, 15 workers of ICT who were
members of the Singapore Business Houses Employees Union began a sitdown
strike to protest against the management’s alleged refusal to negotiate
over pay and working conditions, and its deployment of expatriate British
staff to maintain operations during the strike.[^24] As the subsequent case
studies of NCR and IBM also show, there was now a growing momentum
of knowledge transfer, with more locals being trained and taking on
managerial positions as these corporations deepened their engagement with
the region.

#### **NCR’s Machine-Conscious Cashiers and Models**

The National Cash Register Company was formally incorporated in
Dayton, Ohio, in 1884. Its first advertisement in the broadsheets of British
Malaya appeared some two decades later, warning of the problem of
inefficiency and theft in manual accounting systems, and promising that “a
National cash register stops leaks”.[^25] This 1905 advertisement in the <i>Straits
Times</i> heralded the start of NCR’s marketing and publicity campaign in the
region, conducted through the media and public exhibitions.

Up to the Second World War, NCR’s cash registers and accounting
machines were distributed by local companies serving as representatives.[^26]
The first NCR branch in Malaya was established in 1950,[^27]and by 1967,
there were 12 offices and service depots in Malaysia and Singapore.[^28]
Recognising Southeast Asia’s potential, the multinational positioned Singapore as its regional headquarters.[^29] NCR attributed the popularity
of its products – sales in Malaya quadrupled between 1953 and 1959 – to
customers’ new business practices and expectations: “People in Malaya and
other Eastern countries are becoming increasingly office machine-conscious.
In this atomic age, they want efficiency, speed and accuracy.”[^30]

NCR was active in staging exhibitions to promote both its own
machines as well as products that it marketed in its role as the designated
local agent.[^31] Public personalities who visited its exhibitions included
Singapore’s first Chief Minister, David Marshall, who was briefed by the
corporation’s representatives.[^32]

During this period, NCR machines were installed in some of the
city’s major businesses, like Fitzpatrick’s supermarket and the ethnic
Chinese-operated Lee Wah Bank,[^33] heralding a new era of transaction and
accounting practices in Singapore. In 1958, the corporation showcased its
latest cash register, installed at Fitzpatrick’s, to the <i>Singapore Free Press</i>.
Describing it as “speedy and error-free” and a “machine that thinks”, the
paper highlighted the convenience of the new registers:

  Ordinarily the clerk would be forced to do some swift mental<br>  arithmetic or more likely, use a pencil and paper to figure the<br>
  customers’ change […] The latest triumph of the National cash<br>  register over man will relieve operator fatigue and protect the<br>
  cashier, who is responsible for the balance in her machine, as<br>
  well as the customer. And the cash register, unlike either of<br>
  them, is always right.[^34]
		 
Accompanying the story was a photograph of a female Fitzpatrick’s
employee seated behind a cash register.

 <div style="background-color: white;">NCR advertisement. <i>Straits Times, 1 January 1958, 14/15. (From NewspaperSG).</i></div>
 
 
On the media front, NCR was perhaps the pioneer in glamorising
and feminising accounting machines in colonial Singapore, as exemplified
by a 1957 print advertisement featuring an endorsement of its products
by the Sheaffer Pen Co. (Figure 3). The text endorsement was, however,
secondary to the image of a Caucasian woman with a broad smile, striking
red blouse and neatly permed hair, pulling a printed bill from an NCR
accounting machine.

The use of mostly female models in NCR’s advertising campaigns
suggests that women dominated the role of operators of its machines. NCR’s
advertising momentum continued into its early computer products in the
1960s, with the introduction of its first desk-size computer business system,
the NCR 395, to Malaysia and Singapore.[^35] However, as the next section
illustrates, it would be another company, IBM, that truly ushered in the
computer age in the region.

#### **From the Beginning: Women and IBM in Singapore**

Founded in 1911 as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company,
IBM took on its present name in 1924. It arrived in colonial Malaya and
Singapore in 1952 with a staff of three.[^36] Within a decade, IBM became
associated with the first computers installed in the region.[^37]

The use of IBM computers in government departments started in April
1963, probably with the intent of symbolically heralding the formation of
the new Malaysian federation comprising Singapore, Sarawak, Sabah and
the Federation of Malaya in September.[^38] A year later, an IBM 1440 was
installed at the Lee Rubber Company in Singapore, then the largest exporter
of rubber in the world. The company’s extensive regional network of rubber
plantations, mills, factories and warehouses was managed by its Singapore
headquarters.[^39]

Technological milestones became part of both national pride and
industry achievements. Formally launching the Electronic Data Processing
unit of the Finance Ministry in 1964, Singapore’s Deputy Prime Minister
Dr Toh Chin Chye cited the time savings with the new computer. It reduced
the time taken to compile data on voters in the electoral roll from 600 hours
to 60 hours. The number of days taken to prepare the payroll of 39,000
monthly rated government employees was also reduced, from 26 days to 8.[^40]

A Straits Times correspondent had earlier described the setup in celebratory
and futuristic tones:

  In a big air-conditioned office in Fullerton Building, a modern<br>
  office is taking shape. An office common to giant commercial<br>  complexes of New York and London. Gone from this office,<br>
  eventually will be the normal complement of clerks and typists<br>  Coming into its place: Rows and rows of girls punching holes<br>  on automatic machines-and serving the “brain.” The brain<br>  
is an electronic computer just installed in the third floor of<br>  the building for processing accounts and statistics of the<br>
  Finance Ministry.[^41]

Around 20 of the unit’s 60 female clerk-operators were already trained
to turn “facts and figures into codes” using the new computers, punching
around 10,000 holes a day – more than twice as fast as on the dated
accounting machines.[^42] Like their predecessors deployed on the Powers-
Samas accounting machines three decades earlier, these women operators
were similarly on the frontline of data modernisation.

Figure 4 shows a woman operator demonstrating the IBM computer to
Dr Toh at the Treasury in Singapore. The only woman in the photograph,
she was probably the lowest-ranked in the group, but her photographic
presence gives critical visibility to her generation of computer operators in
the region.

#### **Conclusion: Finding the Keypuncher Generation**

Beginning as a trickle in the early 1900s with NCR’s cash registers, the
diffusion and adoption of mechanised accounting systems in British Malaya
gained momentum in the 1930s with the installation of ICT’s Powers-Samas
machines. Disrupted by the Japanese Occupation, the pace picked up again
in the late 1940s, given the urgent need to restore administration functions,
coupled with the new push by American corporations NCR and IBM into
the colony’s emerging computer markets.

The proto-history of computerisation in Malaya and Singapore – namely
the transition from manual accounting practices to accounting machines

to mainframe computers – has yet to be given detailed scholarly coverage.
In this gap lies a hidden history of women operators as frontliners of these
new technologies. Gendered perceptions of computer cultures as male
undertakings have also been projected onto technological historiographies
to assume women’s absence in the field. This paper has shown that women
in fact actively participated in Malaya’s proto-history of computers. As
operators in each of the successive waves of technological advancement, they
may be considered part of the pioneering keypuncher generation – the first
data proletariats.

[^18]: Following Ainger’s retirement in 1952, a job advertisement was placed for a replacement with the responsibility of supervising the preparation of reports by the Powers-Samas punch card systems as well as the operation of the machines. With a salary range of $420–$620 per month, the advertisements also stated a preference for “females between the ages of 30 and 40 years” and “satisfactory educational background”. “[Page 8 Advertisements Column 1](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/digitised/article/straitstimes19520229-1.2.100.1),” _Straits Times_, 29 February 1952, 8.

Details on these operators were available in job advertisements after the Second World War, which indicated significant increases in the qualifications of candidates, the scope of responsibilities and the remuneration. A short paragraph in an advertisement in 1950 only mentioned the salary of $70 per month as well as preferably Cambridge certification. “[Page 11 Advertisements Column 4](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/digitised/article/maltribune19500331-1.2.109.4),” _Malaya Tribune_, 31 March 1950, 11 (From NewspaperSG). Six years later, a lengthier paragraph detailed the requirements of residency status as British subjects, prior experience operating the Powers-Samas machines, as well as possessing a “Standard VII” educational background. The salary range had also increased to $137–$197 per month. What remained unchanged was the requirement for applicants to be females below the age of 25. “[Page 14 Advertisements Column 1](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/digitised/article/straitstimes19560218-1.2.183.1),” _Straits Times,_ 18 February 1956, 14.
