<h3>The history of the Singapore Speedway was as fast and furious as the races it hosted.</h3><p>By Yap Jo Lin</p><p></p><p>Before the bright lights, glitz, glamour and celebrity of the Formula One Singapore Night Race, there was the Singapore Grand Prix (which started in 1961). But 30 years before that, speedsters and curious locals alike were privy to the thrills and spills of motorcycle racing at a specially constructed dirt track called the Singapore Speedway.</p><p>The Speedway had a very short life. It hosted just six races from April to June 1930 before its closure, but it marks an interesting and important chapter of Singapore’s motor-racing history. It was located at Alkaff Avenue, near the junction of Macpherson and Upper Serangoon roads, roughly where Sennett Estate is today,<a href="#_ftn1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[1]</a> and next to Alkaff Lake Gardens, which had opened a year earlier in 1929.</p><p>News of the Speedway first broke on 3 December 1928, when the <em>Straits Times</em> reported that Australian promoter F. Heron Pitcher was in town to set up a company to run the Speedway, and that efforts were underway to identify a site.<a href="#_ftn2" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[2]</a> Pitcher claimed to have “ample evidence” that dirt track racing would have wide and universal appeal in Singapore. “… I have no doubt that once the people see the races they will want more,” he said. “Besides having some of the greatest experts of the dirt track in the world performing on the Singapore track, opportunities will be given for local amateurs and professionals to race, for which trophies and cash prizes will be given.”<a href="#_ftn3" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[3]</a></p><p>In the months leading up to the Speedway’s debut, another Australian came on board as managing director – a Mr. A. J. Reynolds, whose last stint was as an advertising manager for Western Australia Speedways Ltd.<a href="#_ftn4" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[4]</a> Reynolds came to Singapore with almost three decades of experience in the entertainment and sports industries under his belt. Reynolds had a colourful past. When he was 15, Reynolds joined a troupe of acrobats touring Australia. He eventually left the troupe and received some technical training on the applications of electricity in commerce. He managed a few cinemas and several racetracks in Australia before turning his attention to racing in Singapore.<a href="#_ftn5" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[5]</a></p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

	<b>Speedway Construction</b><br><br>
Construction of the Speedway started in February 1930 and was reported to have cost $40,000. It was spread out over 11.5 acres with an initial planned capacity of 5,000 spectators. The racetrack was 440 yards (402 metres) long and 8 inches (20 cm) thick. According to the Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser, the track comprised “a mixture of sand, cinders, decomposed granite, loam soil and screen [granite powder] and saturated with water, rendering it completely dustless”.[^6]<br><br>
The Speedway was designed by Keys and Dowdeswell, a well-known architectural firm in Singapore that had worked on Capitol Building and Capitol Theatre (both c.1930). Founding partners Percy Hubert Keys and Frank Dowdeswell had been in government service when they designed the Fullerton Building in the late 1920s (now known as the Fullerton Hotel).<br><br>
The buildings at the Speedway included three octagonal ticket kiosks, a rectangular shed with seating for spectators, an enclosure for motorcyclists adjacent to the track, and men’s and women’s lavatories. There were two updates to the plans submitted for approval. The first was for the removal of a refreshment room with a bar counter, a “crush hall” or a foyer/reception area, and a manager’s office from the design. The changes might have been made to lower costs and/or accelerate the project’s completion. The second update was for additional seating along the racetrack.<br><br>
