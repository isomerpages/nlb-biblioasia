#### The grandeur and opulence of Eu Villa on Mount Sophia was unrivalled in its heyday.
By Patricia Lin

Eu Villa, the home of Eu Tong Sen (1877–1941), was perhaps the most spectacular mansion to be built in Singapore in the early years of the 20th century that was owned by a Straits Chinese. Nicknamed “the King of Tin”, Eu was also the man behind traditional Chinese medicine retailer Eu Yan Sang.

Eu was born in Penang on 23 July 1877 but received his early education in Foshan, China. His father Eu Kong, who left his hometown of Foshan for Penang in 1873, was a self-made millionaire. The elder Eu had the foresight to later venture into business in the then remote town of Gopeng in the Kampar district of Perak.[^1]&nbsp;

He took over his father’s business at the relative early age of 21 following the latter’s untimely death in 1890. He parlayed his father’s concerns into mining, rubber, banking, traditional Chinese medicine, entertainment and hotels. Like many of the Chinese entrepreneurs of his time, Eu’s wealth was also accrued through the acquisition of British monopolies for opium, alcohol and gambling.[^2]&nbsp;

#### **An Opulent Mansion**

Eu Villa on Adis Road was the third mansion to be built at the site on Mount Sophia. The first home belonged to Municipal Engineer W.T. Carrington, who had purchased the two-acre property from merchant Charles Robert Prinsep and built Carrington House sometime around 1873 (by 1840, Prinsep had established a huge nutmeg and coffee plantation on the hill and in the surrounding areas). Little is known as to who owned the property following Carington’s death in 1878.[^3]

In 1903, the house was purchased by Nissim N. Adis, the Calcutta barrister and businessman. Adis demolished the Carrington edifice and built a luxurious mansion that came to be known as Adis Lodge. It had a steel and concrete construction, and a commanding view of Singapore.&nbsp; The mansion had eight bedrooms and boasted a bathroom for each bedroom, with hot and cold running water.[^4]

The Adis family occupied their lodge for less than 10 years before the property was purchased by Eu Tong Sen. Evidently unimpressed by the elegance and opulence of Adis Lodge, he proceeded to demolish the building and built the villa that would be unrivaled for decades.[^5] Eu Villa would be only one of a string of luxurious mansions that he commissioned to be built in Singapore, Hong Kong (where he had two palatial homes), Gopeng and Kuala Lumpur.[^6] Rumour has it that Eu had been told by a seer that he had to keep building if he wished to live a long life, and build he did.

Eu Villa, which commanded a panoramic view of the town and harbour, was designed by the architectural firm of Swan &amp; Maclaren for a million dollars and completed in 1913. “Eu Villa has the mark of a millionaire in all its commodious premises. It is built like a chateau – the French influence is strong – and its dull-white exterior shines like a pearl under the burning tropical sun” reported the _Straits Times_ in 1934.[^7]

The villa’s main building was five storeys high and had a dome. The villa also had a basement and wine cellar, and in addition to the stairs, it had “an electric passenger-controlled lift” said to be “the first of its kind in this part of the world”. Eu had installed the lift for his mother to take to the top floor to enjoy the view.[^8]&nbsp; In early 1916, a telephone with the number 44 was installed in the villa.[^9]

Although described as being built along the lines of a French chateau, Eu Villa’s design was more in keeping with the Edwardian Baroque style with its eclectic integration of Florentine and other embellishments which its owner apparently favoured. These included the dome that would become the signature feature of the villa.

According to architect Lee Kip Lin, Eu Villa’s drum and lantern dome was probably one of the earliest seen in Singapore’s private homes, and that similar domes would later appear on the homes of Chinese businessmen Low Teng Lin and Teo Hoo Lye.[^10]

#### **Marble and Statues**

Another feature that came to be unique to Eu Villa was the copious use of marble. Eu loved marble and the villa was a veritable celebration in marble. There were sea-green marble pillars, floors with marble of every color possible and marble statues in the garden as well as in the villa itself.&nbsp;

The statues depicting mythological figures such as Phrine, Eve, Bacchante, the hunteress Dinah, Apollo and Venus were all provided by Raoul Bigazzi from Florence. The company, which specialised in marble statues, mosaics, bronze work and floors, was also responsible for the work done on Chartered Bank, the Municipal Building, the Supreme Court, Hong Kong Bank and the Union Insurance Building in Singapore before the World War II. &nbsp;After the war, the company provided and installed the marble for Bank of China, the Lim Bo Seng Memorial and Finlayson House in Singapore, among the many other buildings throughout Asia.[^11]

Murals and artworks by Italian painter Egisto Ferroni, Austrian Impressionist and artist Franz Hofer, and British artists John Sargent Noble and Alexander Mark Rossi were scattered throughout Eu Villa. A full-length portrait of Eu painted in 1928 graced the billiard room, while a life-sized bronze statue was placed in the living room.

The furnishings throughout the mansion were an eclectic mix: the drawing room featured gilt furniture in the style of Louis XIV, while Chinese chairs adorned the dining room. Most of the furniture was supplied by the finest stores in London and Paris, while Chinese and Persian carpets lined the floors.[^12]

#### **Building an Annex**

Within the first few years of his occupancy, Eu deemed his dining room too small to accommodate the ever-growing numbers at his dinner parties. An annex was built to the main house with a dining room that could comfortably seat one hundred guests on the ground floor, while the second floor housed a ballroom that was the same size as the one in Raffles Hotel.[^13]&nbsp;

As a member of “the King’s Chinese”,[^14] Eu was mindful to hang an oil painting of King George V and Queen Mary prominently overlooking the dining room. Two massive gongs in the shape of bells summoned guests to dinner in the dining room lit by three huge chandeliers.[^15]&nbsp;

The staircase leading up to the ballroom was flanked by a pair of Florentine nudes in white marble, and the stairs themselves were carpeted in red plush. In its heyday, the ballroom was said to have been the scene of many a glittering event. A key feature of the ballroom was the large stained glass window.[^16]&nbsp;
