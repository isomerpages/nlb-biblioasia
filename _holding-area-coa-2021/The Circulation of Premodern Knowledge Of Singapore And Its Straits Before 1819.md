#### **Introduction**

In 1907, the British colonial official Frank Swettenham expressed his
surprise that in the 600 years between the fall of Temasek and the founding
of a trading post on the island, no European had enough curiosity and
application to learn about Singapore’s history nor recognised its potential
as a strategic site.[^1] Swettenham was implicitly suggesting that there was
knowledge in circulation. All it took was a little snooping about, and he was
right; references to Singapore or its straits can be easily found in European
literature before 1819.

Swettenham was not the only one to have recognised these references.
Other scholars had too, but they were disparaging of their value. Kenneth
Tregonning, then Raffles Professor of History at the University of
Singapore, famously dismissed the study of precolonial Singapore in 1969
as being of no relevance and “of antiquarian interest only”.[^2] Later historians such as Mary Turnbull and Lim Joo-Jock were equally unenthusiastic about
a search for Singapore’s older roots, adding that the historical record relating
to Singapore and its straits before the 19th century was not only scarce but
also fragmentary, vague and contradictory.[^3] Not only was making sense of
these references of premodern Singapore discouraged, it was also seen as
unfashionable and unprofitable.[^4]

However, the scholarship in the past three decades has challenged these
assumptions. Archaeological work and archival research, in particular, have
shown that there was a thriving settlement and that precolonial Singapore
was not as irrelevant as once assumed.[^5] As more testimonies come to light,
historians are now working towards unifying them into the longer narrative
of Singapore’s past.[^6] Despite this progress, we have yet to tackle these
references found in European literature, as hinted at by Swettenham long
ago. Hence the objective of this paper is to collect these references related to
Singapore and its straits in European literature and question whether they
are as scarce, fragmentary, vague and contradictory as formerly supposed.

Lim Joo-Jock had in 1991 suggested two possible approaches: either one
can summarise all the available evidence and present them in chronological
order, or one can focus on the tangible pieces and draw a series of insights
from them.[^7] Sophie Sim has rightly deemed these approaches insufficient,
because they lack critical analysis and fail to deal with the power and
ambiguities of memory.[^8] Here I adapt these suggestions and perspectives in
the following manner. First, I quantify the references about Singapore or its
straits in European literature, focusing on the genre of these publications, the languages they were published in, and their growth in numbers by
the century. What emerges is clear: these references are not as scarce as
previously thought. Second, through a close reading of these references in
European literature, I present the impressions a European reader would have
had of Singapore before 1819. Finally, in putting these references together
across three centuries, I argue that they should not be dismissed, because
they offer us ways to rethink Singapore’s history and contain important
clues for charting the future of Singapore’s pasts.

#### **Quantifying Knowledge**

Unlike what earlier historians have suggested, references to Singapore
and its straits are both copious and varied. Today we can count close to
400 published works that include a reference to either Singapore or its
straits before 1819, sometimes both, and these works range from chronicles
and travelogues to poetry and fiction. The large number of publications
containing references shows that there was sufficient knowledge circulating
in European literature. Several of these, like European travelogues, sailing
rutters, and chronicles have been explored in detail and have been used
to reconstruct Singapore’s past before 1819. Other references can be found
in religious accounts, magazines, pamphlets, periodicals, journals, plays
and anthologies, but not all have been studied in detail. The sheer number
of references points to a widespread cognizance of Singapore, if not of
the region. A very large number of references (about 153) are contained
in compendia, a category that has escaped attention so far. Comprising
publications such as geographies, cosmographies, dictionaries, lexicons and
encyclopaedias, the compendia helped condense and transmit knowledge of
Singapore and showed how the general reader understood “Singapore” at a
particular point in time.

Singapore and its straits feature several times in fiction, such as in the
novels of Daniel Defoe, and can be found in Spanish, Portuguese and
Dutch poems as well.[^9] Despite the small number of such publications (about 16 so far), they point to creative imaginings of Singapore before the modern
period.[^10] Another important genre of knowledge is the travel anthology.
Narratives and accounts were plucked from different sources spanning
various languages, regions and periods, and compiled into volumes of
collected travels. Europe has a long tradition of publishing collected travel
accounts, which were often lavishly illustrated and extremely costly.[^11] By the
18th century, the genre gained popularity and increased in circulation. For
example, the four-volume travel compendium, A Collection of Voyages and
Travels, first issued in 1704 by the brothers Awnsham and John Churchill,
was reprinted with two additional volumes in 1732. A third edition appeared
in 1744–46, followed by a fourth in 1752, published by the bookseller
Thomas Osborne.[^12] Although this repackaging increased the spread of
knowledge of Singapore and its straits, it also had the effect of recycling
existing knowledge for new readers.

These references are also found in different languages and point to a
wide dispersion and transmission of knowledge across Europe. There is
a substantial number of references to Singapore and its straits in Latin,
especially in the 16th century, when Latin functioned as a scholarly language
for learning. Latin publications with references to Singapore were often
initially textual aids to cartographic material. Later Latin publications
provided more detail, with many describing Singapore as a city within the
Kingdom of Siam. An important work written in Latin were the letters of
St. Francis Xavier (1506–52), a celebrated Jesuit who travelled to the Far
East. His letters dispatched when he was anchored off Singapore (“ex freto
Syncapurano”, Latin for “from the Straits of Singapore”) helped reinforce the
knowledge in religious circles that Singapore was an important station up
to the 19th century.[^13] After 1650, the Romance and Germanic vernaculars
began to replace Latin, and more references to Singapore appeared in
publications in Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, French, English, German and Dutch. At present, there are many collected publications in English and
French, but larger-than-expected numbers in these languages might simply
reflect current digitisation efforts. It is clear from tracing the circulation
of information that these references were often drawn from a similar set
of sources. For example, English descriptions of the Malay Peninsula,
Singapore and its straits depended heavily on information provided by
English travellers such as William Dampier and Alexander Hamilton. On
the other hand, French publications relied on knowledge translated into
French. Pierre d’Avity’s Le Monde (The World), a popular and widely read
publication in the early 17th century, contains references to Singapore
and the wider straits region. But a closer examination shows that this
information was extensively compiled from the works of the Portuguese
historian João de Barros and the French Jesuit Pierre du Jarric.[^14] This overreliance
on a few transmitted sources perhaps testifies to how little was
known in England and France about Singapore and its straits before 1819.

Finally, references to Singapore and its straits increased from the 16th
to 18th century, which reflected developments in the print industry and
the growing demand for travel literature. In the 16th century, references
to Singapore and its straits were still limited to the Portuguese chronicles,
translated or otherwise, and a few religious accounts. This number increased
with time. By the 1560s, an increasing number of cosmographies and
geographies, mostly written in Latin, became popular, a development that
mirrored the broader curiosity and interest in the wider world. By the end
of the 17th century, references that touch on Singapore and its straits had
doubled in number. This growth was spurred by the increasing voyages to
and writing of the East and also by the development of the book trade in
major centres such as London, Paris and the Low Countries.[^15] As Daniel
Roche has shown, European printers published 1,566 travelogues in the
17th century compared to 456 a century before. By the end of the 18th
century, the number of travelogues had more than doubled to 3,540. This
development added considerably to the knowledge base of Singapore and the wider straits region.[^16] The 18th century was the age when knowledge of
Singapore and its straits reached the growing masses. Technical innovations
in publishing, increased mobility, the development of scientific societies,
and an expanding base of readership meant that more references than before
reached curious audiences.

#### **Qualifying Knowledge**

However, the number of references to Singapore and/or its straits does not
always mean that they contain a wealth of detail. Many publications contain
no more than a name and tell us little about the island or its history. That
said, regardless of length and detail, the reader of the literature would have
possibly formed four impressions of Singapore. These impressions were
consistent within European publications before 1819 and can be summed as
such: Singapore was a place of danger, division, antiquity and concentration.
The impressions occasionally overlap but hardly deviate from these patterns
of description.

***A place of danger***

The immediate impression a reader would have had of Singapore and its
straits was that it was a place of great danger. A combination of fierce
storms, difficult seascape, and vulnerability to ambush led the area around
Singapore, in particular its channel, to gain a certain notoriety. The
Portuguese writers João de Barros and Brás de Albuquerque referred to
Singapore as *falsa demora*, which meant a tricky place to interrupt one’s
voyage or a place where ships were lost while waiting.[^17]  Irregular and rapid
tides, hidden sandbanks and treacherous rocks made navigation risky and
caused many ships to meet with shipwreck. The ships carrying the Japanese
Tenshō embassy to Rome in 1584 met with such a mishap, hitting a shallow rock in the Singapore straits and losing their valuable cargo, although the
crew was thankfully saved from danger.[^18] Another account was penned
by the Spanish Dominican priest Domingo Navarrete, who crossed the
straits of Singapore around the mid-17th century. Navarrete wrote, too,
about how other sailors in Canton faced difficulties in sailing through the
narrow passage and overdramatised the violent currents that “whirl’d a
ship about with its sails abroad”.[^19] When the Italian priest Matteo Ripa
travelled from Melaka to Manila in 1708, the Armenian ship he was on
hit submerged rocks in shallow waters and was about to founder off the
island of Singapore. Matteo was said to have performed a miracle, and the
ship eventually sailed on safely.[^20] These three incidents from three different
centuries are some of the many incidents that made plain to readers the
dangers of geography around Singapore.

There were also numerous instances of local attacks on Europeans in
the Singapore region. Readers today would be familiar with the account
of Jacques de Coutre (not published until the 20th century), who was
ambushed by Orang Laut vessels off present-day Sentosa in the 17th
century.[^21] Yet his account was not unique. European readers back then
could read the account of Portuguese priest Melchior Barreto, who was
attacked en route to Macao in the 16th century. When Barreto’s Portuguese
caravel ran aground in the Singapore straits in April 1555, the party was
attacked by 50 local Orang Laut perahu[^22] that fell upon them with loud
screams.[^23] Occasionally, the area in and around Singapore was the setting
for battles between Malay kingdoms and became perilous for Europeans
caught in the crossfire. For example, the Spanish Friar Diego Aduarte witnessed 80 large galleys belonging to the Sultan of Aceh pitched for battle
in the Singapore straits against those of Johor.[^24] The incoming Governor of
Macao, Antonio de Albuquerque Coelho, who wintered in Johor in 1717,
wrote his account of Raja Kecil of Siak, who assembled a large and powerful
fleet at the mouth of the Singapore straits in preparation to conquer Johor.[^25]
These accounts in European literature undoubtedly helped to shape the
perception of Singapore and its straits as a place of mortal danger.

***A place of division***

As geographical knowledge expanded with discovery and conquest,
early European cartographers and geographers tried to reconcile the new
information with existing knowledge from ancient Ptolemaic geography. As
sailors relied on visual landmarks to navigate past the maze of islands at the
tip of the Malay Peninsula, prominent outcroppings such as Batu Berlayar
(Batu Berlayar Point, Labrador Park) and Pedra Branca, as well as hilly
landforms such as Mount Berbukit (Bukit Pelali, Pengarang) and Romania
Point (Tanjung Penyusop) in the region became important navigation
markers. This information likely circulated back to Europe and created the
misperception that one of the elevated landforms was Singapore, which
agreed with Ptolemy’s 2nd-century description of a cape and city located at
the southernmost tip of Asia. Singapore thus came to be referenced as a cape
from the 16th century onwards.

Singapore’s mistaken identification as a prominent promontory in texts
and maps led to it being taken as a notional marker of division. Singapore
was cited in the Portuguese poem, *Os Lusíadas* by Luís Vaz de Camões
(1572), as a turning point, and João de Barros’s *Da Ásia* (1562) divided the
sixth and the seventh part of the East Indies from “Cape Singapura”.[^26]
This divisional marker was adopted by later writers such as Faria y Sousa
(1666–75) and the geographer Pierre Duval, the editor of François Pyrard’s travelogue (1679).[^27] Other writers made this distinction for practical
reasons, since two maritime zones (the South China Sea and the Bay of
Bengal) overlapped around the Singapore region.[^28] This idea of transition
is memorably expressed in Albuquerque’s *Commentaries* (1576), which
referenced Portuguese ships arriving at the “gate” (*porta*) of Singapore,
demarcating a point of crossing.[^29] The repeated assertions created by
cartography and writing reinforced the mental geography of Singapore
and its straits as a dividing point between two different regions of Asia
(Figure 1).

&amp; Pegu, etc..</i>[The true depiction or illustration of all the coasts and lands of China, Cochin China,
Cambodia, Siam, Malacca, Arracan and Pegu, etc.], 1596.</div>


Besides dividing the two maritime zones, the “cape” of Singapore
was also seen as separating the Asian mainland from the island world
of Southeast Asia, notably from Sumatra and Java. Thomas Herbert’s
observation that Singapore was a former trading town that marked the
southernly cape of the Asian continent and divided it from Sumatra was a
common impression at the time. This statement would become the standard
definition in most encyclopaedia and dictionary entries in the 18th century.[^30]
These assumptions of Singapore as a cape and dividing marker came to be
deeply entrenched in European thought and proved resilient well into the
19th century.

***A place of antiquity***

As Swettenham had surmised, Europeans had access to knowledge about
Singapore’s antiquity. We can trace two strands of knowledge: from
the Portuguese chronicles in the 16th century and through the Dutch
minister François Valentijn’s writings in the early 18th century. Several
Portuguese writers in the early 16th century, such as João de Barros and
Brás de Albuquerque, had written parts of Singapore’s early history. This
knowledge of Singapore’s antiquity did not arise from an intrinsic interest
in Singapore’s past per se, but was prompted by concerns over administering
Melaka as a new Portuguese colony after its capture in 1511. The broad
outline of this story focuses on the exploits of Parameswara, particularly his
flight from Palembang after his unsuccessful revolt, his arrival in Singapore,
the subsequent murder of his host and usurpation of both the kingship
and kingdom. After being driven out of Singapore, he went on to establish
Melaka, which became famous as a trading emporium. This information
likely stemmed from the oral accounts that the Portuguese collected after
becoming masters of the port and town of Melaka. This knowledge sheds
light on not only Singapore’s antiquity, but also its connections with the
wider Malay world.[^31]

These Portuguese writings circulated throughout Europe, spreading
knowledge of Singapore and the wider straits region to curious audiences. 

One such circuit took it to 16th-century Italy, to humanist centres such as
Florence and Venice.[^32] Barros’s account (1562) was translated into Italian
within a year and was cited by the geographer Giovanni Battista Ramusio.[^33]
Ramusio was an avid collector and compiled his own set of travel writings,
including an abridged extract of the Portuguese apothecary Tomé Pires’s
*Suma Oriental* (1512–15), a work not published until 1944.[^34] Other snippets
of the Singapore story found in Barros’s or Albuquerque’s accounts were
cited in the celebrated *Cosmographia* (1628), attributed to the German
geographer Sebastian Münster, bringing knowledge to German readership.[^35]
Another circuit of knowledge took it to France and England. The French
traveller Vincent le Blanc’s account (1662), for example, mentioned “a certain
tyrant who had wanted to seize the state of Singapore […] which was the
entry to all the Orient and commanded the whole country”.[^36] Similarly,
the third volume of the English cleric Peter Heylyn’s *Cosmographie* (1652)
contained an account of Parameswara, which also explained how Singapore
could be considered as the mother of Melaka.[^37] These three accounts of the
17th century show how far knowledge originating from Portuguese writings
of Singapore and its straits had circulated.


In the 18th century, Barros’s and Albuquerque’s accounts found a
new outlet and audience through reprinted travel collections. The most
comprehensive anthologies were published by the Leiden publisher Van der
Aa in the 1700s, with various other snippets and extracts republished in
other popular collected volumes, such as the Churchill brothers’ *A Collection of Voyages and Travels* (1704) and *The Modern Part of an Universal History*
(1759–66).[^38]

A second strand of knowledge came from Valentijn’s influential
publication, *Oud en Nieuw Oost-Indiën* (Old and New East-Indies; 1724–26)
(Figure 2). In composing his work, Valentijn acquired and referred to several
Malay manuscripts, such as the *Hikayat Hang Tuah*(c. 1688–1710) and
the *Sulalat-us Salatin* (c. 1612).[^39] By drawing on these sources, Valentijn
conveyed to his readers that Singapore was not only the first city or town
of the Malays that moreover lent its name to the nearby straits, but also the
seat of several kings before its transfer to Melaka.[^40] This knowledge was later
cited in several compendia of the late 18th century and consulted by several
prominent writers.[^41] Through the knowledge distilled from acquired Malay
manuscripts and the reprints of old Portuguese chronicles, the majority
of readers came to know of or became familiar with the straits region and
Singapore’s early history.

***A place of concentration***

Finally, Singapore and its straits have long been considered a place of
strategic significance. Singapore’s position straddling two maritime zones

Valentijn’s<i> Oud en nieuw Oost Indiën</i> [Old and New East Indies] (Dordrecht and Amsterdam: Joannes van Braam and Gerard onder de Linden, 1724–26). </div>


has made it a key conduit for world shipping and a meeting place for
cultures and societies. However, the area around Singapore was also a
strategic bottleneck to concentrate military forces to harass competitors
or jostle for influence. The importance of controlling the area around
Singapore was not lost on the European powers. The Dutch, Portuguese and
even the Spanish had considered establishing forts in the vicinity and had
on various occasions gathered forces off Singapore.[^42] 

Portuguese ships blockaded and fought around the Johor River in
the 16th century. The Dutch gathered there and captured the richly laden
Portuguese carrack *Santa Catarina* in 1603 off the coast of Singapore, where
the Spanish armada also assembled in 1616. These exploits of large sea forces
concentrated around Singapore could be read in the European literature of
the day.[^43] (Figure 3)[^44]

Erédia, Math[ematic]o. Anno 1615</i> [History of the services and martyrdom of Luís Monteiro Coutinho,
arranged by Manuel Godinho de Éredia] (Goa, 1615), 49.</div>

In the 17th century, the Dutch identified Singapore and its straits as a
strategic chokepoint of world trade and sent *jachten*[^45] and sloops to cruise
in and around the area. The high points of Dutch concentration were
during the early years of the offensive (1602–09) and the period when they
stepped up their attempts to capture Portuguese Melaka (1633–41). Dutch
ships were instructed to secure their shipping lines, while disrupting those
of the Portuguese.[^46] Because of the success of this operation, Singapore or the area around it became known, especially in Iberian travel literature,
as a place where the Dutch concentrated their forces. A good number of
travel accounts were written by priests harassed by Dutch ships while en
route to China or Japan. For example, the Portuguese priest Gil de Abreu
was captured in the Singapore straits and imprisoned in Batavia.[^47] The
Italian Jesuit Marcello Mastril was more fortunate, narrowly escaping
capture by three Dutch ships in the area in 1636.[^48] One such battle with
the “Hollanders who fought with valiant spirits around Singapore” was
memorialised by the Portuguese Miguel Botelho de Carvalho in the Spanish
poem, *La Filis* (1641).[^49] 

After the Dutch took Melaka in 1641 and gained ascendancy in the East
Indies, references in the European literature of the 17th and 18th centuries
continued to complain about Dutch concentration and control of the
waters in and around Singapore. Jean Chardin, the French jeweller, wrote
in his travelogue how Indian ships had to obtain passports from the Dutch
“through favour, recommendations and presents” before they could pass
through the Singapore straits.[^50] Spain and Portugal, which had colonial
outposts in Manila and Macau and maintained trade with China, also
opined negative views of Dutch control and their concentration of ships
in the straits region. For example, the *Historical Extract* of Antonio José
Alvarez de Abreu, a study of commercial relations between the Philippines
and Spain published in 1736, states this plainly: “The commerce of these
two cities [Manila and Macau] is sustained by the Strait of Singapore,
and always at risk of the Dutch.”[^51] This opinion of Dutch concentration
of ships in the region is also prevalent in other European writings of the
18th century.

#### **Questioning Knowledge**

Having examined the number and types of references to Singapore and its
straits before 1819, and the four consistent impressions that a premodern
European reader would have formed, we can now ask: what role do these
references have to play in the context of Singapore’s history? There are four
main ways that these references in European literature can still be useful for
rethinking and writing about Singapore’s past.

***A bridgehead***

As suggested by other scholars, these references help us to connect
Singapore’s pre-1819 past with its present and clarify its place in the
region. Historians today are identifying and retrieving materials relevant
to Singapore to build a longer 700-year history. Although the post-1819
historical narrative is still more substantial, the more detailed references
found in European literature help add more episodes and evidence
that testify to Singapore’s precolonial past.[^52] The other smaller and less
descriptive references might not always indicate settlement and activity on
the island, but they nevertheless help us to better contextualise Singapore
within the region and (re)consider its connections to other places in
Southeast Asia.[^53] Furthermore, some scholars argue that Singapore can be
seen to have repeatedly reinvented itself in response to the geographical
and cultural changes, with notable up-and-down cycles.[^54] These references
testify that in the three centuries before 1819, even though we know little
about what was happening on the island, Singapore was far from forgotten
and still made an impression in the thoughts of readers far away in Europe.

***Formation of knowledge***

These references also provide a first step towards understanding the
formation of knowledge of Singapore and its straits. By looking at how
knowledge was formed and circulated through these references, we better
understand how we arrived at vague and contradictory descriptions of
Singapore before 1819.

The first reason has to do with the elasticity of the name. European
travellers applied the name to a variety of landforms and seascapes in
and around the Singapore region, which has led to confusion over what
exactly is being referred to. A second reason has to do with the growth of
different strands of knowledge. While in the early 16th century references
to Singapore as a city and cape arose because writers attempted to reconcile
newer discoveries with classical Ptolemaic knowledge,[^55] the Portuguese
chronicles and later travel writing were responsible for putting into
circulation knowledge about Singapore’s earlier incarnations as a strait,
capital and kingdom. The result was several competing descriptions or
definitions of Singapore, which led to significant confusion regarding
Singapore as a place in time. It is sometimes possible to read these errors or
inconsistencies within the same publication. For example, in the celebrated
Dutch collection of voyages, *Begin en Voortgangh van de Oost-Indische
Compagnie* (Origin and progress of the Dutch East India Company; 1646)
by the Amsterdam publisher Isaac Commelin, Singapore appears in the
course of 17 pages as a city (*stadt*), a cape (*cabo*), a strait (*strate*) and a village
(*dorp*).[^56] It is clear that these references to Singapore and its straits reflect a
mix of current, classical and historical knowledge – all in the same work. A
third reason has to do with the transmission of knowledge, which increased
confusion about Singapore over time. Writers who had never visited the
East Indies wrote about these places based on the books that were at their
disposal. Even though this demonstrated engagement with knowledge of
Singapore and increased the number of references, they also multiplied the
confusion already extant in publications.[^57]
And as dictionaries and encyclopaedias began to proliferate on the
market in the 18th century, compilers began to draw information from
various travel accounts and publications to produce standardised definitions
of peoples, places and things.[^58] Because various definitions were repeatedly
copied and rearranged in disregard of time and context, these entries lost touch with the realities they described. In many compendia, it would not
be out of place to read this entry on Singapore found in the *Encyclopaedia
Perthensis*, published in 1816, just three years before the founding of a British
trading post in Singapore.

**Sincapora, Sincapoura, or Sincapura**. An island and
cape, with its capital on the S[outh] coast of Melaka;
opposite Sumatra.

**Sincapura, Straits of**, a narrow channel between the above
island, Melaka and Sumatra.[^59]

The three spellings of Singapore and four different definitions
of Singapore – as a strait, an island, a cape and a capital – represent
the wisdom and errors of three centuries of acquiring and circulating
knowledge, which had swelled to the point of confusion and contradiction.
These entries patently show that the European records of Singapore and
its straits are not sequenced according to the internal developments of the
region and its peoples, but have become jumbled up with other realities that
have little to do with its past.

***New ideas and old assumptions***

Third, these references help us to generate new ideas and discard older
assumptions about Singapore. The four impressions that a European reader
would have had of Singapore and its straits do not support the idea that
Singapore appears after 440 years of neglect as a knowable and distinct place
in history.[^60] Singapore had always been a knowable place not only in the
region but also to European audiences, despite British claims that Singapore
was terra incognita. In addition, our current impressions of Singapore as a
point of division, as a strategic location and a place of antiquity are shown
here to have been in circulation for a long time and shaped by literary
engagement. Beyond casting aside older views, these references can also
help to illuminate older and forgotten connections. For example, references
to Singapore as a city of Siam hint at a deeper relationship between ancient
Singapore and Thailand. Comparing these references might also help
produce connected histories that tell us more about Singapore’s past. In their travel accounts, Alonso Ramirez and William Dampier both noted passing
Singapore around 1687. Dampier benefited from refreshments from the
Orang Laut, while Ramirez attacked them.[^61] Seen separately, the accounts
tell us little, but taken together, they point towards a period of intense
activity in and around the Singapore region. The chances of finding other
connections are small but not improbable. It must be cautioned, however,
that these European references to Singapore and its straits cannot stand
alone; they must be corroborated, too, with other Asian texts and evidence
to produce a more complete picture.

***The future of Singapore’s past***

Finally, these references can serve as an oracle for the future of Singapore’s
past(s). With increased digitisation of publications and greater online
accessibility to these materials, more references of Singapore, if not of its
straits and the wider straits region, are almost certain to be found. This is
true not only of European literature but also other manuscripts, languages
and archives, many of which are not covered here.[^62] Furthermore, references
to Singapore might not always be found under this name. In the European
records, it is not uncommon to find references to Lange Eilant (Long Island)
or Pulau Panjang, designations which also appear on hydrographic charts
before 1819. The Portuguese writers also used the term Ujantana (Ujong
Tanah) to refer to the area around Singapore. With careful reading and
sufficient contextual knowledge, these references can also be added to our
knowledge of Singapore, or the Singapore region.[^63]

However, it is clear from these references that the European writers
had a peripheral vision of Singapore and its straits and did not always tell
us what we would like to know about its past. The published literature
contains little about activity on the island, because the writers rarely visited
it and had little interest or extended experience of the region at large. The
Europeans wrote only about the things they knew and experienced and often repeated what was already known.[^64] This is why the four impressions
stated above will likely continue to characterise other references to Singapore
and its straits in European literature.

#### **Conclusion**

Ultimately, these references to Singapore reveal the current constructs
for understanding its past. But the quest to make meaning is only just
beginning. As Peter Preston reminds us, there is no one Singapore: context
is key.[^65] If we define Singapore as just the island, then the historical record
before 1819 is indeed scarce, fragmentary, vague and contradictory. But if
we look for an idea of Singapore that goes beyond the island and ask more
searching questions about the pieces that we find, then we might come to a
better understanding of what Singapore is and can mean in the past.
