#### **Introduction**
As times change and progress, people's entertainment options have become increasingly diverse. Young people's time and energy are often consumed by games, television series, online shopping, and social media platforms. A 2021 survey conducted by the National Institute of Education found that fewer than 40% of local Secondary 4 students had regular reading habits. Even in such an environment, there remains a group of young people who choose to read books in their spare time. They too feel exhausted by busy lives, but they believe reading can transport them to different worlds, bringing endless joy and rewards. Let's explore their reading world together!

#### **Finding Positive Energy and Life Inspiration**
Reading books helps me gain knowledge and broaden my horizons. Although I don't travel much, reading gives me the opportunity to experience and understand the world, making me a person with warmth and depth of thought.

I particularly enjoy reading inspirational books or motivational psychology titles. These books help me find strength during difficult times, which is truly wonderful.

I have set myself a reading goal of finishing at least two books each month. However, life's demands sometimes leave me with good intentions but insufficient time and energy. In such situations, I turn to social media platforms to watch short videos about books, allowing me to grasp the key content as quickly as possible.

#### **Crossing Dimensions to Witness Extraordinary Tales**
I enjoy reading fantasy, mystery, and horror books, especially stories about things that are difficult to experience in real life. Reading allows me to escape from reality, where my thoughts and imagination soar and shuttle through different dimensions to witness countless fascinating stories.

Reading has opened a door to new worlds for me, where I can touch the souls of different characters and see worlds that have little connection to my daily life through their perspectives.

I can also see the different values and thoughts of people around the world through authors’ writings, which sometimes prompts me to reflect.

#### **Stepping into Characters’ Shoes to Experience Colourful Lives**
I don’t like reading while waiting for transport, nor do I enjoy reading on the MRT. The feeling of being forced to stop before I have properly settled in makes me very frustrated and affects my reading experience. I try to finish a book in one go, temporarily “blocking out” the problems I need to consider in reality and enjoying the feeling of being immersed in the book’s world. But since starting secondary school, I found that quiet reading time has become increasingly scarce. I usually get home very late and feel particularly tired.

When I read interesting stories, I put myself in the characters’ shoes, experiencing their joys and sorrows, successes and failures alongside them. Therefore, my book selection depends on my current mood – when I'm in a good mood, I can read anything, but when I'm feeling down, I avoid depressing or heavy books.

Reading allows me to encounter different eras, experience different lives, and feel different emotions. Every time I read, I find joy in it.

#### **Conclusion**
Reading habits vary from person to person. Some people enjoy the ideas that books present, while others prefer to immerse themselves in the joy of reading. Regardless of which type they are, young people who love reading all regard books as comfort for the soul. Perhaps the fast pace of life forces them to sacrifice reading time to focus on their studies, but I believe they will still pick up a book and read earnestly whenever they find a rare moment of respite.
