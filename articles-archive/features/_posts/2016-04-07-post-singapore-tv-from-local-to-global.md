#### **Lau Joon-Nie** charts the rise of Singaporean television from the first test transmissions to the advent of foreign competition posed by the arrival of cable.

Mention *Growing Up* to any 30-something Singapore TV fan and watch his or her face light up with a wistful look of nostalgia. Singapore’s longest-running English language drama series – which debuted in 1996 and ended its run in 2001[^1] – ran for six seasons, detailing the ups and downs of the fictional Tay family who lived through the 1960s to the 80s. Viewers lapped up the meticulously recreated scenes of yesteryear with its retro outfits and hairstyles, and carefully curated furniture, cash registers, telephones, radio and TV sets, and other such miscellany of the period.

By coincidence, the Tay family grew up in an era when television first made its foray into Singapore. 15 February 1963 was a momentous day for TV in Singapore when the government started a pilot service, following a feasibility study in the 1950s[^2] and a series of test transmissions before the official launch. “Tonight might well mark the start of a social and cultural revolution in our lives”, said then Minister for Culture S. Rajaratnam, the first person to appear on national TV when he launched Television Singapura at the Victoria Memorial Hall.

Outside, thousands had gathered in anticipation to watch the first black-and-white TV images come to life on a few dozen TV sets placed around Empress Place for the occasion. The first programme aired at exactly 6.05 pm was a 15-minute documentary, TV Looks at Singapore, introducing the concept of television and its impact on the lives of Singaporeans. This was followed by two cartoon clips, news in English, a comedy skit and a variety show titled *Rampaian Malaysia* (“Malaysian Mixture”). Transmission ended at 7.40pm.[^3]

At the time of the launch in 1963, just 8 percent of households owned a TV set.[^4] For those without one, 50 public viewing points were set up across the island, at places such as community centres. Within six months, the Channel 5 broadcasts in English and Malay increased from a weekly one-hour programme to five hours a day on weekdays and 10 hours a day over the weekend. Channel 8 was launched in November that same year with programmes in Mandarin and Tamil. By 1965, all programming was handled by Radio and Television Singapore (RTS), under the Department of Broadcasting of the Ministry of Culture.

#### **Colour Comes to Singapore**

Singaporeans were ecstatic to be among the first in Southeast Asia to enjoy colour broadcasts in mid-1974, snapping up home colour TV sets during the first 10 weeks of its launch. Not all programming was available in colour though. Newscasts only went full colour during phase two of the roll-out in November that year. Colour TV sets soon replaced black-and-white ones at the community centres, the five-year roll-out costing S$8 million.
