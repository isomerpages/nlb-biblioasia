Professor Yu Chun Yee previously taught at the Royal College of Music in London. At age 18, he won the prestigious Singapore Musical Society’s pianoforte competition in 1955 judged by Julius Katchen. Here, Yu plays on the recently [refurbished Chappell grand](/vol-19/issue-3/oct-dec-2023/chappell-piano-repair-zhivko-girginov/) once used by international pianists at the Victoria Memorial Hall. A cheaper replacement for the Memorial Hall's old Steinway grand, the piano has a [chequered history](/vol-19/issue-3/oct-dec-2023/chappell-steinway-piano/) and was widely criticised for its tone. It is now a public piano at the National Library Building.
