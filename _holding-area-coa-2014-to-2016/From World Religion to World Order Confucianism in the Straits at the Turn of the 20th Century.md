#### **Introduction**
This essay explores the impact of the emerging scholarly discipline of the
“science of religion” on the Confucianist movement in Singapore in the late
19th and early 20th centuries. Anna Sun’s recent study on the modern origin of Confucianism as a “world religion” foregrounds the role of James Legge, a missionary and an Oxford University professor, in the establishment and dissemination of the scholarly category of “Confucianism” in the period.1
However, her study is limited to an exploration of the impact of Legge’s
scholarship on the study of world religions in the Western academic and
missionary circles.

The author hardly mentions Legge’s career in Malacca and the influence his study of Chinese classics had on missionary and Confucian reformist circles in Singapore at the turn of the 20th century. While it delineates a historical arc that connects mutual contestations between the secular and religious interpretations of Confucianism from the 19th century British Empire to present-day China, her book neglects analogous debates articulated in the Confucianist and Christian intellectual circles in the Straits of Malacca.

This essay is an attempt to include the voices of Confucian reformers in the
Straits of Malacca in the study of the history of Confucianism in its modern,
global format. It will highlight the formative role of intellectual exchanges,
between Western scholars and/or missionaries and local Confucianist
thinkers, in the conceptualisation of Confucianism as, simultaneously, a
national (Chinese) religion and transnational (global) political force. Apart
from East Asian societies and states, Confucianism has also played an
important role in Southeast Asia. Historical trajectories behind the relatively
recent (2006) acknowledgement of Confucianism as a state-sponsored
religion in Indonesia, and Confucianism as an ethical regime that governs
the conditions to sociability in postcolonial Singapore, deserve comparative
studies of their own.

As an initial step in that direction, this essay discusses the articulations of
Confucianism through the perspective of the comparative study of religions,
as it was understood by the Confucian reformers in Singapore – led by Lim
Boon Keng – at the turn of the 20th century. I will argue that the debates
between the Chinese reformists and the Straits-based British missionaries
on the religious status of Confucianism cannot be properly understood
without taking Legge’s academic and missionary/theological authority into
consideration. This argument is supported by an analysis of a series of essays
and notes written by Lim during the period. By placing Legge within the
history of the Confucian reformist movement in the Straits of Malacca, I
aim to foreground the constitutive role of Southeast Asian reformers in the
modern history of Confucianism in its global dimension.

Missionaries and scholars of world religions played a role in the debates
where Confucianism was introduced onto the world map as a religion and
promoted as a leading force in a new, China-centred global order as it was
imagined from within the Straits of Malacca. The religion-related debates in
the Straits of Malacca were no exception in the period under consideration.
According to Peter van der Veer, religions in the Chinese and Indian
modern contexts were transformed into “moral sources of citizenship and
national belonging” – rather than marginalised or eliminated – through
their contact with the emerging political project of secularism as a colonial
governing tool of religious and cultural difference.2

Apart from playing a crucial role in the formulation of “national imaginaries”,
the encounter with the imperial West enabled religions to be utilised to form
– or imagine – supranational alliances and “alternative visions of the moral
state”.3 This essay will show that the case of Lim Boon Keng’s articulations
of Confucianism, as a religion and source of transnational moral citizenship,
is an excellent example of the contradictory effect of secularism in a colonial
setting, in van der Veer’s sense. In the spirit of the times, Legge conceptualised
Confucian religion as a defining element of the Chinese race/nation. It was
through a critical study of Legge’s translations, conceived from within the
imperial context of Britain and related global missionary aspirations, that
Lim developed his perspective of Confucianism as, simultaneously, a national
(Chinese) and supranational (global) social and historical force, fit to form the
basis of a new world order. In other words, Lim conceptualised the new world
with a reformed China as its leader.

This essay will show that Lim’s personal engagement in, or substantial
proximity to, the mutually opposing/constitutive social and historical
projects – i.e. Christian proselytisation and the Confucianist movement,
were, in van der Veer’s sense, responsible for the formation of a neutral
cognitive space. That space was contained in the newly established “science
of religion” which, with its authority anchored in rationality and “scientific
objectivity”, had a pacifying effect on the debate between missionaries and
Confucian reformists. In other words, the authority of deciding about the
religious or secular/philosophical nature of Confucianism was placed in the
realm of science, at a distance from ecclesiastic authorities. Lim’s multiple
political alliances (to Britain and a reformed China) also decidedly marked
his image of Confucianism as compatible with liberal democracy. In short,
Lim embraced the lessons learned from his reading of the scientific approach
to the study of world religions and used them to build his view of a new
world history with Confucianism as its progressive goal. In this process, Lim
adopted, contested or elaborated on Legge’s translations of the Confucian
classics and views on Confucianism in relation to Christianity.

Lim’s crucial role in the Confucianist movement in the Straits has already
received substantial scholarly attention.4 However, his engagement with Legge’s scholarly work is noted only in passing.5 In addition, Lim’s
knowledge of the science of religion and its impact on his articulation of
Confucianism as a world religion has entirely evaded the attention of the
scholars working on the topic.

This essay, in turn, foregrounds the historical entanglement, between
Protestant contestations and scholarly world-religion consolidations of
Confucianism, in the construction of Lim’s view of this religion, and its
place in the new world order as a political form of universal humanity,
and a condition to modern, transnational and moral citizenship. Apart
from van der Veer’s study, my approach to the study of the emergence of
Confucianism, as a religion and global ethos in the Straits of Malacca, is
also indebted to Tomoko Masuzawa’s study of the history of the concept
of “world religion” within the discipline of science of religion and, in
particular, the epistemic formation of this concept’s universalistic, supraethnic,
or transnational, character.6

As Masuzawa shows, during the 19th century, the category of “world
religion” emerged to help articulate the self-image of Europe as an ideal
model of universal history, or leader of an international, global order on
the one hand. On the other, this new category also served to (self) portray
Europe as the sole custodian of harmonious regulation of internal differences
within nation-states.7 Stated otherwise, world religions through their study
within the new discipline of science of religion were approached as defining
elements of non-European nations.8 The study presented in this essay, like
those of van der Veer’s and Sun’s, acknowledges the ultimate intellectual
legacy of Talal Asad’s enquiry into the mutual formation of the religious and
the secular through the colonial encounter.9
