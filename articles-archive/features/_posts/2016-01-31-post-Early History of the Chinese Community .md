As part of the celebrations for the 100th anniversary of Singapore’s founding, a book was commissioned to detail the history and contributions of the colony’s Chinese community.1 This became the classic text, *One Hundred Years’ History of the Chinese in Singapore*, which chronicles 19th-century Chinese society in Singapore 
from 1819 to 1919. The 602-page tome also serves as an excellent reference on the who’s who in Singapore’s early Chinese community, particularly the Straits Chinese elites.

Originally envisioned as individual chapters in another seminal publication, One Hundred Years of Singapore (see page 26), the history of the Chinese in Singapore 
proved weighty enough for the book’s editors – Walter Makepeace, Gilbert Edward Brooke and Roland St. John Braddell – to spin it off as a separate title. Song Ong Siang was asked to write the book, and it was published in London by John Murray in 1923 (and not in 1902 as stated on its flyleaf). The book has been reprinted three 
times, most recently in 1984 by Oxford University Press.2
