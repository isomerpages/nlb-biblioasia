#### **Much more than a tourist souvenir, Singapore’s gold-plated RISIS orchids were a triumph of grit and branding.**
By Sharad Pandian

In December 1982, Princess Diana attended the glitzy London premier of Richard Attenborough’s film _Gandhi_. To mark the occasion, Singapore gifted her with its signature product – orchids. Specifically, she was sent 5,000 orchid stems and a brooch with a gold-plated orchid.[^1] This gold-plated trinket was the RISIS (rhymes with “crisis”) orchid that was wildly popular in the 1970s and 80s, to the extent that it had a serious claim to being Singapore’s national souvenir.

#### **An Identity for Singapore**

To understand the origin of the RISIS orchid, we need to look to the intersection of historical necessity and individual idiosyncrasy. Finding a national souvenir was a problem for Singapore even before its independence. Conscious of the importance of tourism for the economy, the government established the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (STPB) in 1963.[^2] One of the committees created at its very first meeting was the Souvenirs Committee.[^3] After all, “\[e\]very traveller wants something to bring home as proof and reminder of the place he visited,” informed the _Straits Times_ in 1964. The committee therefore was tasked with “finding a suitable emblem and the types of souvenirs that \[could\] be produced locally which \[would\] not only be a keepsake but a constant reminder of Singapore.”[^4]

By the early 1970s, tourism had emerged as a leading sector of economic growth in Singapore. In 1970, 113,000 more people visited the country compared to the previous year, swelling the number of total visitors to 521,650. Income from tourism correspondingly increased by 21.3 percent to $273 million, accounting for nearly 5 percent of the national GDP.[^5]

However, Singapore had not yet settled on an appropriate national souvenir. In 1970, Koh Book Piang, an expert on handicrafts, estimated that while tourists in Singapore spent as much as $5 million on souvenirs annually, only 1 percent of this was going towards Singapore-made souvenirs.[^6] The problem, Koh suggested, was that while an item like the boomerang was readily associated with Australia, there was no equivalent for Singapore. He mused, “What item can I mention so that you can associate with Singapore? I would say practically nil.”[^7]

Concurrently, the _Straits Times_ grimly reported in 1970 that “\[i\]t is officially recognised that a ‘Singapore image’ must be found fast – to inject purpose, prestige and profit into the cottage souvenir industry.”[^8] Ideas mooted by surveyed tourists included small statues of Stamford Raffles, busts of then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, figurines depicting the four major races, and even a Singapore-shaped music box that played the national anthem. The STPB’s Souvenirs Committee had recommended the Merlion as early as 1964, but it had not won universal acclaim. One government official, for example, was doubtful that it would gain national prestige since “\[t\]he merlion is symbolic of our name and marine status, but not of our people.”[^9]

Enter Dr Lee Kum Tatt who had been appointed chairman of the Singapore Institute of Standards and Industrial Research (SISIR) in 1969. By his own account, his interest in souvenirs began in 1955 when his fiancée – later his wife – made a passing remark at the Singapore Botanic Gardens wishing that the orchids they were admiring could last forever.[^10] He began working on this idea in earnest after a trade mission to Eastern Europe in 1967. Noticing that his European hosts were delighted by the orchids he’d given to them, Lee decided to experiment with preserving orchids in gold, based on nothing more than a gut feeling that it would be popular.

Lee thought that gold-plated orchids was the perfect choice for a souvenir as Singapore was already known for its orchids, not only routinely presenting them to guests but also exporting large shipments of them. There was a thriving Singapore Orchid Society; and the President of the South East Asia Orchid Society was usually a Singaporean. Singapore was also a leader in orchid hybridisation. For all these reasons, Lee felt that “\[t\]he gold orchid had all the attributes of a true souvenir. It used local material (orchids) and local technology or skill (hybridisation and metal-forming), as well as time-honoured gold.”[^11]

However, coming up with the idea was one thing, turning it into reality was another. “We were basically trying to create an instant Singapore souvenir in the same way we plant instant trees, or make instant coffee,” Lee explained. “It certainly did not look promising.”[^12] Trained as a chemist, Lee’s early experiments were conducted at home with makeshift plastic equipment. The need for more systematic research led him to use $25,000 from SISIR’s reserve fund for official investigation using its facilities. Fittingly, once perfected, Lee gave one of the first orchids to his wife.[^13] Another early creation was given to Singapore’s then First Lady Yeo Seh Geok (wife of President Benjamin Sheares) in 1975.[^14] The name for this gold-plated flower simply a reversal of “SISIR” – the institution behind it – and thus RISIS was born.

Days before the official launch of RISIS in April 1976, SISIR created a subsidiary, Setsco Pte Ltd, to handle full-scale commercial production of the gold-plated flowers. Setsco subsequently created RISIS Pte Ltd, a subsidiary dedicated to handling its gold-plated products. The RISIS orchid was available at nearly 70 stores around the island when it was launched.[^15]
