  “Majulah Singapura”, and its official Children’s Day song, “Semoga Bahagia”.
  Working with theatre company Wild Rice, musical director Julian Wong put
  together a critically acclaimed production on the life of Pak Zubir that mixed
  history, music and memory in a moving show that led to sold out performances
  in 2022 and 2024. In this episode, Julian tells us the challenges of
  researching and performing those songs, and reveals if he’s a Swiftie.
