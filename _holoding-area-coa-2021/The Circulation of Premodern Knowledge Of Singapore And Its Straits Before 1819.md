#### **Introduction**

In 1907, the British colonial official Frank Swettenham expressed his
surprise that in the 600 years between the fall of Temasek and the founding
of a trading post on the island, no European had enough curiosity and
application to learn about Singapore’s history nor recognised its potential
as a strategic site.1 Swettenham was implicitly suggesting that there was
knowledge in circulation. All it took was a little snooping about, and he was
right; references to Singapore or its straits can be easily found in European
literature before 1819.

Swettenham was not the only one to have recognised these references.
Other scholars had too, but they were disparaging of their value. Kenneth
Tregonning, then Raffles Professor of History at the University of
Singapore, famously dismissed the study of precolonial Singapore in 1969
as being of no relevance and “of antiquarian interest only”.2 Later historians such as Mary Turnbull and Lim Joo-Jock were equally unenthusiastic about
a search for Singapore’s older roots, adding that the historical record relating
to Singapore and its straits before the 19th century was not only scarce but
also fragmentary, vague and contradictory.3 Not only was making sense of
these references of premodern Singapore discouraged, it was also seen as
unfashionable and unprofitable.4

However, the scholarship in the past three decades has challenged these
assumptions. Archaeological work and archival research, in particular, have
shown that there was a thriving settlement and that precolonial Singapore
was not as irrelevant as once assumed.5 As more testimonies come to light,
historians are now working towards unifying them into the longer narrative
of Singapore’s past.6 Despite this progress, we have yet to tackle these
references found in European literature, as hinted at by Swettenham long
ago. Hence the objective of this paper is to collect these references related to
Singapore and its straits in European literature and question whether they
are as scarce, fragmentary, vague and contradictory as formerly supposed.

Lim Joo-Jock had in 1991 suggested two possible approaches: either one
can summarise all the available evidence and present them in chronological
order, or one can focus on the tangible pieces and draw a series of insights
from them.7 Sophie Sim has rightly deemed these approaches insufficient,
because they lack critical analysis and fail to deal with the power and
ambiguities of memory.8 Here I adapt these suggestions and perspectives in
the following manner. First, I quantify the references about Singapore or its
straits in European literature, focusing on the genre of these publications, the languages they were published in, and their growth in numbers by
the century. What emerges is clear: these references are not as scarce as
previously thought. Second, through a close reading of these references in
European literature, I present the impressions a European reader would have
had of Singapore before 1819. Finally, in putting these references together
across three centuries, I argue that they should not be dismissed, because
they offer us ways to rethink Singapore’s history and contain important
clues for charting the future of Singapore’s pasts.
