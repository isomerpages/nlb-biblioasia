<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Hi everyone. My name is Jimmy Yap, and I’m the Editor-in-Chief of <em>BiblioAsia</em>,
a publication of the National Library of Singapore. Today, we know <em>kueh pie tie</em> as
a Peranakan dish. A pastry cup, stuffed with delicious <em>popiah</em> filling.
But what is this <em>pie tie</em>? Is it really a <em>kueh</em>? To help
us answer this question is Christopher Tan, a writer, photographer and
cooking instructor. He’s the author of the award-winning <em>The</em>  <em>Way of Kueh</em>.
On Instagram, he is known as @thewayofkueh and he writes about his food
adventures with amazing photography and videos.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Christopher was a guest on an episode on the second season of the National
Library’s cooking show <em>From Book to Cook</em>. And in that episode,
he made <em>kueh pie tie</em> using a recipe from the 1950s. And that’s what
we’re talking about today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to BiblioAsia+, Christopher. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
<br>Thank you, Jimmy. Happy to be here.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Tell us about the origins of the name of this dish. So, kind of a weird
name, right? You did some detective work about the origins of this dish.
Tell us what you found.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
<br>Yeah. So, the fact that the word “pie” is smack in the middle of the name.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Yes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
<br>You know, that’s not a Malay word, And I refuse to believe that it derives
from Hokkien because pie means broken, right? <em>Pai liao</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>[laughs]&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
<br>I’m sure that’s not a part of its origin, but, you know, it’s just an
interesting name – <em>kueh pie tie</em>. Doesn’t sound like any other thing.
The first question I asked was why is it spelled that way? Why is it spelled
like the English word “pie”? And [the] second question I asked was how
long has it been spelled that way? And then I did some digging in the online
newspaper archives.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br><a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">NewspaperSG</a>,
you mean?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
<br>Yep. <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">NewspaperSG</a>.
And I realised that <em>kueh pie tee</em> was not always spelled <em>kueh pie tee</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if you go back far enough, some of the oldest mentions of it, they
spelled it [as] “kueh<em> </em>patty”.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Ah, okay, so what’s that?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
<br>P-a-t-t-y. Okay. Which, you know, huge light bulb above my head. Once
I discovered that and then I started digging into other sources like vintage
cookbook texts, and I realised that a lot of old cookbooks also called
it <em>kueh patty</em>. Not <em>kueh pie tee</em>. I conjecture that <em>pie tee</em> just
elided from <em>patty</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay, so that sort of makes sense. But what do you mean by <em>patty</em>?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
<br>Okay, so this is where it gets really, really interesting. If you’ve never
seen <em>kueh pie tee</em> shells being made, okay, they are crispy pastry
cups.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, you know, as we explored in the video that I filmed for NLB, how
you do it is you preheat a heavy metal mould in hot oil and then you dip
it into batter just for a few seconds so that a thin film of batter adheres
to the surface of the mould. Then you put it back in the hot oil and the
batter starts to fry and eventually comes away from the mould in a cup
shape. And then you slowly fry it until it’s crispy and brown.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Sounds delicious.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
<br>And what’s very interesting is that this particular method of dipping
a mould into batter and then into hot fat is a very, very old one. Okay.
According to the <em>Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery</em>, one of the
earliest mentions of this style of frying things is from 1570 and a very
famous cook from the Italian renaissance called Bartolomeo Scappi, who
calls them <em>frittelle</em>, mentions that the models for this fritter
are made in the form of lions, eagles, knots and other fanciful shapes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay, so it’s a very, very old method of frying. And we also know this
method of frying from <em>kueh</em> rose, sometimes known as <em>kueh kuyang</em> or <em>kueh loyang</em>,
which is you have that very sort of flower-shaped, pattern shaped mould
with holes in it, and then you get this lacy honeycomb looking <em>kueh</em>,
right?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Yes, yes. Now I know what you’re talking about.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
<br>Chinese New Year and Deepavali and Hari Raya you see them. It’s one of
the very, very ecumenical ways. You see it at all festivals. All right.
The <em>kueh</em> stalls. So, <em>kueh</em> rose is part of that family. And
this is such an old recipe. It’s such an old way of frying. It’s found
around the world. And when I say around the world, I really mean around
the world. You find them in Iran, in Goa, in Indonesia, in Scandinavia.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
<br>Scandinavians brought it to the US. You know, you find it in Spain and
the South Americas, all these places. So that may sound tangential, but
that’s all necessary to understanding the history of <em>pie tee</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, these Scandinavian immigrants who brought this method of frying and
this recipe to the States, they called them rosettes. So, what we call
them is <em>kueh</em> rose. And the rosette moulds in the US usually were
sold in sets. So, you get one handle that was removable and then several
different shaped moulds that you could screw onto the handle. So, you could
make several different shapes with one kit.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
<br>I displayed one of these in the video to show everyone what shapes were
allowable. And apart from the sort of the flower shapes with multiple holes
and petals and frills, there was also a range of shapes where you could
just make cups.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the biggest rosette iron sets came with many different cup shapes
– deep ones, shallow ones. In the video I used one that was shaped like
a fish, another one shaped like a slice of pie, and they had standard sort
of fluted cup shapes which are practically identical to our <em>kueh pie tee</em> moulds.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Yeah. And these are moulds that are used in the US?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>In Swedish-American cooking. It’s associated with the Swedish community.
And so, the other name for them was Patty Iron. <em>Aha</em>... Okay. So,
there’s a couple of other names for them. Some people call them <em>timbale </em>moulds
in France. Apparently, in France they also use them and they call them <em>timbale</em>.
It’s a fancy French word for “cup”, basically. And if you go back, dive
back into our local sources, you do find the words “patty iron” and “patty
shell” being associated with <em>kueh pie tee</em>. In our local newspapers,
patty shells were mentioned earlier than <em>kueh pie tee</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Referring to the same dish?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>Referring to <em>a</em> dish. So, we had a couple of American-style recipes,
and I found this in the clippings from the <em>Morning Tribune</em> in 1936
and 1937. They mentioned patty shells, no lengthy explanation of what they
were, but the recipes were for – one was for mock turkey, which is pork.
Don’t ask me why. And it was in a sauce made from cream of mushroom soup
and then spooned into patty shells to serve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[The] second recipe from 1937 was for Crab Supreme, which was crab meat
with peppers and mushrooms, again in a milky sauce and then served in patty
shells. So [by] 1930s, patty shells were certainly here – and I’m sure
that the American expat community was aware of them at this point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then the earliest mention of <em>pie tee</em> spelled – the way that
we spell it today, P-I-E T-E-E – is from 1954, where a reporter writing
about the food fair at the Wesley Church just up the road from where we
are now, the National Archives, mentioned that someone was selling <em>pie tee</em> with
the description: “This consists of bits of meat and vegetable packed in
a tiny pastry cup and bathed in two delicate sauces.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s all the information we were given.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>But I, for one, find it interesting the fact that the reporter felt it
necessary to give a description. In general, people did not encounter [<em>pie tee</em>]
that often. Okay, but apart from that we have no idea whether this was
an Asian or Western dish, meat and vegetables.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And in the <em>Singapore Free Press</em> on 1 April 1958, I hope – hopefully
this was not an April Fool’s joke – but they had an article about what
you should stock, what equipment every good cook’s kitchen should have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And in it was the line, “It would not be amiss if you added to this list
a kueh patty iron for frying batter.” And it’s spelt P-A-T-T-Y. But the
word is <em>kueh</em> patty iron. So, this is the earliest concrete link
we have to the American patty iron.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>Back in 1978, the <em>New Nation</em> reported on a shop at Joo Chiat, which
is still there – Kueh Guan Huat. And it says, I quote, “A shop at 95 Joo
Chiat Road, which sells freshly made white and egg <em>popiah</em> skins
as well as <em>kueh pie tee </em>cups (crispy patty shells).” So, it still
explicitly equates <em>kueh pie tee</em> cups with patty shells, which is,
you know, another firm link to the American name for them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>In your episode of <em>From Book to Cook</em> – you made <em>kueh pie tee</em> using
a recipe from Suzy Hing’s cookbook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p><em><a href="https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/redir/itemdetails?bid=4078437" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">In a Malayan Kitchen</a></em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>That was actually published in 1956. So, for the people haven’t watched
the video yet, how is Suzy Hing’s recipe different from the <em>kueh pie tee</em> that
we know today?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>So how it’s different from what we know today as <em>pie tee</em> – she
used milk as the base for the sauce thickened with flour, which has been
fried in butter first. So, it’s like a classic white sauce, what the British
would call a white sauce. You fry seasonings and ingredients in butter,
you add flour and then cook until the flour gelatinises and thickens. Then
you pour in milk and cook it all down into a sauce. And that’s what we
did in the video. So, and then you spoon it into the patty shells. So,
it is very close to what the Americans also served their patty shells.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's so interesting, you know, for years we’ve been eating <em>pie tee</em> and,
you know, until I wrote my book, <em>The Way of Kueh</em>, it never occurred
to me to delve into the history as deeply as this. And so, all of this,
you know, the first time I clapped eyes on all this information, it was
all new to me as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Fantastic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>So, I just find it, you know, some of our heritage foods have such an
unlikely and unexpected origin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>You filmed yourself [making <em>pie tee</em>] on Instagram and it looked
like a lot of work. You take the hot mould and then you dip it in batter
and you put in hot oil. I was like, okay, it looks really dangerous. I
mean, it looked really pretty on your video. It looks really dangerous.
And I’m like, okay, maybe it’s just better to buy these shells, but is
there a reason to make them on your own these days?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>I mean, okay, I don’t want to impose my priorities on all the cooks out
there, but I always think if you want to know how good something can really
be and how good something can really taste, you have to make it for yourself
at least once.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>People didn’t think twice really about making their own <em>pie tee</em> shells,
and insofar as it is related to <em>popiah</em>. It’s one of these festive
dishes that everyone has a hand in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, you know, whether, like my family, we would have a <em>popiah</em> party
and we would have a huge pot of <em>popiah</em> filling, inevitably there
would be <em>pie tee</em> shells as well. So, you have both of them at the
same meal and then you farm out the garnishes. Someone makes the filling,
someone cuts the cucumber, someone makes the egg, someone slices and fries
a <em>lap cheong</em>, someone cooks the prawns, you know, someone makes
the chili sauce, someone picks the coriander, someone makes the <em>pie tee</em> shells.</p>
<p>So, divide and conquer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Pie tee</em> is one of these dishes that to me emphasises and embodies
family ties and community ties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Okay, don’t tell anybody. But when I have <em>popiah</em> parties, I order
it and then they have all the ingredients and all the things. And I make
it very badly and everything collapses, as I put it in my mouth. But, you
know, let's just keep this a secret between the two of us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>As long as your mouth is happy, that’s the most important thing, you know?
But I encourage everyone, if you’ve never made it, it is quite fun, you
know? And for people who are scared of dipping things into hot oil, just
use a deep pot and don’t fill it more than half full of oil, so that there’s
plenty of air space above the oil so that any, you know, splashes will
not leap out at you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And because you actually keep the heat relatively low, because you have
to slowly fry the patty shell until it’s crispy. So, it’s not you know,
other things are fried at much higher temperatures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>You’re very familiar with old cookbooks. What’s special about this? I
mean, what stood out for you when you went through this cookbook?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>First thing was the cover. Actually, when I first saw it, you know, the
fact that it’s called <em><a href="https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/redir/itemdetails?bid=4078437" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">In a Malayan Kitchen</a></em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, this is when Singapore and Malaysia were collectively referred to
as Malaya. And then on the cover is a hand-drawn illustration of four different
ladies dressed in different ethnic dress like <em>kebaya</em> and sari and <em>samfu</em>,
you know, and it’s quite clearly a multi-ethnic cookbook from the get-go,
from the cover. And it sort of lays out, in a very diverse and fascinating
selection of recipes, how people cooked in Malaya at the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that it’s recipes that she acquired or created over her lifetime,
and she put them in the book for her family and so, you know, if it’s an
accurate representation of how she used to cook – and we have no reason
to believe that it's not – you know, it seems to be a very personal and
detailed collection of recipes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then it really shows you how cosmopolitan home cooks were. You know, Suzy
Hing was from Samarang, which is one of the provincial capitals of Central
Java and Indonesia’s fifth largest city. And it was part of the Dutch East
Indies back in the late 1600s. You know, so you’ve had a colonial presence
there as far back as that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the city today has a lot of examples of colonial Dutch architecture,
as well as Chinese temples. And there’s a lot of multi-ethnic influences
blending and co-existing side-by-side in Samarang. And that is reflected
in her cookbook. You know, you have very Anglo-style dishes, you have very
Dutch dishes, including the <em>rissole </em>I mentioned, and you have Dutch-Indonesian
dishes which combine both Indonesian and Dutch ingredients and influences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then you have fairly Chinese dishes as well. And then you have some
dishes which are pure Indonesian.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>It really is a Malayan sort of cookbook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>And if you look at other cookbooks from around the same time, Ellis Handy’s,
you know, <em>My Favourite Recipes</em>. They were similarly freewheeling
in that respect, you know, mixing Malay and Chinese and Eurasian and Peranakan
and Western dishes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Up till very, very recently, most people only knew Suzy Hing because of
the name on that cookbook.</p>
<p>But then somehow very recently we’ve just come to know a little bit more
about that. Part of it, you know, is thanks to you. So, give us a little
bit of an insight into how that happened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>Ah, so, I did previously write about one of Suzy Hing’s recipes in <em>BiblioAsia</em>,
an article I did about <em><a href="https://biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg/vol-16/issue-4/jan-mar-2021/kueh-lapis/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">kueh lapis legit</a></em> otherwise
known as <em>spekkoek</em>. A very classic Dutch-slash-Indonesian version
of the dish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, after I wrote that article, I also did some posts on my Instagram
account screenshotting some of the very interesting pictures of cooking
equipment and recipes in a book. And then someone left a comment on my
post saying, “I happen to be Suzy Hing’s great-niece.” Social media has
a lot of pros and cons, but one of the pros is making connections like
this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>It’s amazing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually, what’s happened since is that we’ve done some research on our
end and I think a lot of people suspected Suzy Hing had a Javanese connection
because of the recipes in her book. But as a result of this, you know,
through some very convoluted method, we’ve come to find someone who actually
knew Suzy Hing, her grandnephew, Malcolm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you rightly mentioned, she was from Samarang. She was born at the turn
of the 20th-century. She was the second daughter of Goh Kek Sin. She came
to Singapore as a child, sat in RGS, she lived with her great paternal
grandparents in Newton Road. And the Ho Ho Biscuit factory was the family
business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And Suzy married Oscar Hing, who came from British Guyana. But, you know,
sadly, she was widowed at a young age and they had no kids.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The family is well-connected socially because, you know, Lady Yuen-Peng
McNiece, you know, wrote a foreword [for] her cookbook. So, knowing all
this about Suzy, does that give you more insight into her book?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>I think it really explains, you know, why there are so many different
influences in the book. And man, I wish I had been part of her household
back in the day and tasting all these things. That’s fascinating that that
her husband is from British Guyana. Do you know? Guyana is one of the other
places in the world that has pineapple tarts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Oh, really? [laughs] We’re all interconnected through food.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Malcolm said that Suzy had a collection of recipes, all handwritten in
English and Javanese, and she tested these recipes with her cousins who
were all good cooks. And so, these became social gatherings for them. And
nearly every relative had a copy of the book that was published in 1956.
So, you know, she clearly, you know, didn’t want money. The Ho Ho Biscuit
Factory was the family business. She knew Lady Yuen-Peng McNeice. She wasn’t
doing it for the money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It sounds like she probably did it as a way to gather all these recipes
and pass them down to future generations. What does that say to you as
a writer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>It says to me that she was very forward thinking, for one thing. It was
usually the matriarchs who spent time in the kitchen, always had a notebook
of some kind just to collect all their own recipes and newspaper clippings
and things that they learned to pass down to the next generation. And,
you know, to take pains to produce wonderful food for your family, to me,
is one of the most concrete and meaningful expressions of love for your
family and expressions of pride in your heritage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And in the old days the kitchen really was the heart of the home; everyone
congregated there, cooked together there. Ate there or near there. And
yeah, the fact that she would go to so much trouble to put down her recipes,
which – and I must say for the time from 1956, her recipes, while not the
most detailed – are pretty precise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You know, they’re not offhand instructions. She does explicitly tell you,
you know, how to do this and how to do that. The level of detail that she
put in is really impressive and really speaks of her desire to bequeath
something valuable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>I think I really like the word, you know, <em>bequeath</em>, because I
think that’s what it is. Right? We grew up with, you know, cooking that
our parents did for us. And then eventually, you know, sadly, they pass
on. And then if you don’t know how to cook that, then you’ve lost that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know you feature a lot of old cookbooks. What’s the point of collecting
these old cookbooks? You know, there is any value to having these?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>I use Instagram to share knowledge so that everyone can up their game,
you know, whether it’s related to cookbooks or <em>kueh</em> making or cooking
in general. I like to highlight especially heritage knowledge that might
be otherwise be in danger of disappearing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, you know, cookbooks are one of the ways to do that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So not all of the cookbooks that I feature on my Instagram account belong
to me. Some of them belong to other people who have kind of let me read
them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of them are from sort of archive sources. To me, they are the repository
of a country’s cooking know-how, they are a record of how people used to
cook and therefore how people used to eat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>And live.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>And live. And, you know, no cookbook is just a source of recipes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you read between the lines, you can find out all kinds of interesting
conclusions and deductions about how people used think about food and incorporate
food into their lives. You know, and sometimes vintage recipes get a bad
rap for being laborious or for being time consuming or tedious.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I personally always like to use the word “effortful”, because if you put
effort into something, you will reap the rewards of that, you know? And
if something is truly delicious, truly good to eat, I believe it is worth
the effort needed to pull it off. And then again vintage cookbooks are
a window, really, into the past, in a very tangible sense, you know, difficult-to-decipher
measurements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s almost like a time machine. You make a recipe from 50, 60, 100 years
ago. And in a small but not insignificant way, you step into the shoes
of the person who wrote the recipe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>I love that. When I look at an old cookbook, it’s a time machine. And
when you make those dishes – even more so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>That’s amazing. So, the book in <em><a href="https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/redir/itemdetails?bid=4078437" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">In a Malayan Kitchen</a></em>,
is actually going to be reissued sometime in the first half of 2024. It
might even be out by the time this podcast goes out. You know, there’s
going to be photography, you know, updated measurements, and some detail
about Suzy Hing and really gorgeous photographs as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do you feel about this reissue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>I think it’s fantastic. You know, we have so many locally published cookbooks
that deserve to be re-celebrated and reissued and re-highlighted from all
our communities – from the Malay community, from the Indian community,
from the Chinese community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are so many old cookbooks, you know, some of which can be found,
not all of them, but some of them can be found in the Lee Kong Chian Reference
Library. Some of them are in too fragile a state to be easily handled.
But, you know, there is so much treasure there and, you know, you see a
lot of verbal sparring on social media about what should be considered
Singapore’s national dish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Yes, that’s right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>You know, and there are so many dishes that people have utterly forgotten
about that could be possible candidates. And we don’t hear about them.
But they’re there, you know, So I just really feel that, you know, rather
than chasing after what the chefs in Spain or Scandinavia or the US are
doing at the moment, we should all just spend a bit more time delving into
what we had before, and things that have been cooked and enjoyed on our
soil.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>You seem to be writing like, you know, I’ve lost count of the number of
cookbooks you’ve written. How many have you written and what are you working
on now?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>If you count the books that I’ve written solo and those that I’ve also
co-written with other people, I think it’s something like 14 or 15.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Okay, that’s crazy. And what are you working on now?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>So, I think by the time this podcast is released, my next book will be
out on bookshelves. It’s a sequel to my previous cookbook, <em><a href="https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/redir/itemdetails?bid=201179326" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Nerdbaker</a></em>.
And this new one is called <em><a href="https://safe.menlosecurity.com/https:/eservice.nlb.gov.sg/redir/itemdetails?bid=206134361" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Nerdbaker Two: Tales from the Yeast Indies</a></em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Spelled “yeast”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>And “Indies” is like indie music. During the “indoor years”, as I call
them, the last few years, all of us were stuck indoors baking and not allowed
to go out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, the concept for this book I came up with during that time, it’s a
return to my first love, which is baking. And it’s about the very creative
and independent perspectives that good bakers bring to what they do. So,
it’s also a look at that very specific local and Southeast Asian style
of baking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>What is it? What do you mean by a local? Is there a style of baking?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>Look at all the Hainanese bakeries that we have. Again, there’s a few
remaining at Whampoa. And these bakeries, they supply all the <em>kopitiam</em> with
the bread for the <em>kaya </em>toast. They supply French loaf, you know
the old days you didn’t – at least in my family and many Peranakan families
– you didn’t serve chicken curry with rice; you served it with French loaf.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Do you call it a baguette or call it French loaf?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>No, no, no. It’s not a baguette. I must say. That is not a baguette. It’s
a French loaf. <em>Roti perancis</em>. Okay. All right. Yeah. An orthodox
Parisian baguette would be far too chewy to serve with our local food.
So French loaf. It looks like it’s somewhere between a batard and a baguette.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, it’s like a fat baguette, and it has a much softer crumb. And it’s
a very absorbent crumb, which is why we serve it with curry, we make <em>roti John</em>.
We serve it with chili crab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But also look at the kind of baking recipes that Suzy Hing had in her
book. She has recipes for a couple of kinds of bread, one of which is as
an enriched bread, which she calls <em>roti sobeh</em>. She spelled <em>roti sobeh</em> as
in S-O-B-E-H. in Indonesia, it’s called <em>roti sobec</em>, which basically
means “tear”. Tear bread because you bake it as rolls next to each other
and then they fuse as they bake and then you tear them apart to serve.
Everyone goes on about milk bread nowadays. This, in fact, is a very early
example of milk bread now, which again is a colonial legacy in Indonesia.
But I don’t just talk about baking in my book, although it is called <em>Nerd Baker 2</em>,
there are all kinds of steamed <em>kueh</em> and sort of pan-fried things
that we use fermented foods or yeast in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>So, is it like contemporary recipes or are they...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>They are a mix of things. So, I have a recipe for French loaf. And then
there’s a recipe for the <em>kopitiam</em>-style bread. I mentioned in the
book that I was so happy when I finally managed to duplicate that very
soft, spongy <em>kopitiam</em> bread – I did a dance around my kitchen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>The bakeries in Whampoa will put a contract out on you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>Yeah, hopefully not. No, no, no. Please support your local bakeries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay, I want to make that clear. But yeah, so it’s a blend of my own creations
and some classic things and you know, some which are sort of my riffs on
things that we’re all familiar with. So, I have a recipe for an <em>anpan</em> bun,
like a Japanese red bean bun, which is inspired by the original <em>anpan</em> bun
from Japan, as well as what we used to buy from Yaohan. Remember Yaohan?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Yes, yes, yes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Chris</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>That everyone used to queue up for in the 80s? Yeah, things like that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>We met a few days ago and you were talking about toddy and baking and
so this was a bit mind blowing. Why is toddy – I mean, no, I’m sure nobody
will complain about having a bit of alcohol in their bread – but why is
toddy a part of baking?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>Toddy is fermented palm sap – and it can be extracted from various species
of palm coconut palms, Palmyra palms. They have a big spadicle, which is
like a big flower bud. And then if you make cuts in that, they start to
bleed a sweet juice and you collect the juice. And due to wild yeast and
microbes in the environment, this ferments and becomes toddy. Okay, so
it becomes slightly fizzy. The sweetness is enhanced a little bit, and
then the longer you let it ferment, it becomes slightly alcoholic. And
then other microbes start to turn the alcohol into vinegar eventually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Eventually people actually buy it because of the alcohol content, isn’t
it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>Yes, that’s right. I mean, the alcohol content varies a lot depending
on your terroir. You use a fancy French to it. But in the sort of late
1800s, early 1900s, fresh yeast from the west was not readily available
here, and there were not many beer breweries. A lot of places in the West
they would use yeast from beer brewing to also make bread.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that was not common back here. Dry yeast as a commercial product had
yet to be invented. So, a lot of local bakeries, especially the small ones,
would use toddy in their bread dough as a source of yeast. And at that
time, early 1900s, we had, you know, coconut plantations at Geylang and
other places around the island and you could get toddy from them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But toddy was not a particularly reliable source of yeast. The fermentation
was a bit unpredictable. Sometimes it would be very fast, sometimes it
would be slow, sometimes it would be so fast that the bread would end up
with an overly sour taste. And I know sourdough is very trendy now, but
if you use poorly fermented toddy to make bread, apparently the taste was
very disagreeable, kind of dank.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was a slight stigma attached to toddy just because of the unreliability
of it and some of the more European bakers advertised themselves as such
in the local newspapers. And again, you can see all these advertisements
in <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">NewspaperSG</a>,
in [NLB’s] e-resources. They set themselves apart by saying no toddy is
used in our bread.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>I have to ask because I just came back from Melaka. And my father, whenever
he goes back to Melaka he wants to eat, <em>tapai</em>? Is that from rice?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>And I’m very glad you asked me that because I talk all about <em>tapai</em> in
my book as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Oh fantastic!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>So <em>tapai</em> – which is Malay, what the Indonesian equivalent is, <em>tapay</em> –
is a fermented starch of some sort. So, you can have <em>tapai pulut</em>,
which is fermented glutinous rice, which a lot of Malaysia and Indonesia,
and Peranakans make. And then you have <em>tapai ubi kayu</em>, which is
fermented cassava. Okay. And this is a yeast product and you get raggy
yeast which are sold in little balls or cakes, dry yeast, you grind them
up and you mix them with the cooked rice or the cooked cassava, and you
just let them ferment. And then the yeast breaks down the starches into
sugars and it comes becomes a very sweet and delightful dessert. And if
you leave it long enough then you get a very, very, very tiny amount of
alcohol in the whole thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>So, what’s really interesting was because we’re sitting around a wedding
dinner table, and my cousin was saying, “I remember when grandmother, you
know, whenever she made <em>tapai</em>, shooed everybody out of the room.”
Nobody could speak because if you didn’t do it properly, it would turn
pink or something. And so, yes, I guess it speaks to the unreliability
of making.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>And, you know, in the old days before the science of it was fully known,
people would come up with all kinds of explanations to account for how
or why something did not turn out well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, there are a lot of <em>pantang</em> associated – <em>pantang</em> meaning
“taboo” in Malay – associated with the making of <em>tapai</em>. So among
the taboos for <em>tapai </em>were: if you were pregnant or menstruating,
you could not make the <em>tapai</em>. You had to make it with all the doors
and windows closed and with preferably no one else in the room. You could
not wear red while making it because then it would turn red.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>Red or pink is a sign of spoilage in many fermented things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s always some kernel of truth in all this <em>pantang</em>, no matter
how outlandish to us. And in the old days because <em>raggi</em> was again
– and, in fact, these days it is still – made as a cottage industry product.
So, every batch is slightly different. You could never predict exactly
how long fermentation was going to take and you know what potentially ruins
fermentation is rogue microbes. Little yeast, or bacteria, or whatever,
or bacilli, that you don’t want to get into, or ferment, or it would skew
the results. So, by closing those windows, you prevented microbes coming
in from the wind by keeping your hands clean and cleaning everything. You
made sure that no, you know, no other hygiene affected it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And we do know that your physiology, everyone has unique microflora on
their skin, a population of microbes. You know, we all have personal collections
of microbes that live in our intestines and on our skin. Everyone’s profile
is different. And, you know, hormonal changes in your body can affect the
balance of microflora on your skin. And I theorised that that could then,
you know, if you were using your bare hands to make the <em>tapai</em>,
again could have different results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And recent scientific studies have shown that sourdough bakers who bake
with sourdough cultures, again a wild yeast, if they handled their sourdough
with bare hands and if they did this for long periods of time, the range
of microflora and microbes found on their skin [would come] to resemble
the range of microflora found in the sourdough starters. So, you are what
you bake, in that sense, right? So to me, you know, maybe there is, in
fact, a scientific reason for some of these [<em>pantang</em>].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just want to say as well that in my new book, number two, there are
recipes for cakes and breads made with <em>tapai</em>, so if you like <em>tapai</em> okay,
there’s a recipe for how to make <em>tapai ubi kayu</em> from scratch. And
then how to use that <em>tapai ubi kayu</em> to make very interesting traditional
Indonesian breads and cakes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>I’m really excited to read your book. I love the title, by the way. I
think it’s so clever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You just have to rush to the bookshops to buy this book because it sounds
very, very interesting. Christopher, I want to thank you for joining us
on this podcast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we go, though, it’s now time for our very popular quickfire questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is your dream filling for <em>kueh pie tee</em>?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>My dream filling would be an extremely super <em>istimewa</em> deluxe version
of regular <em>pie tee</em> filling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>What would that consist of?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>The basic <em>bankwang</em> as the base but then [cooked] with a really
rich pork stock. And I could use something fancy like Iberico pork, right,
to make a really full-flavored stock. And then I would have mantis prawn,
which is that very succulent prawn. You know, if you have [it] in season,
sometimes there’s a line of roe running through the middle, and in Penang,
you know, you do find some <em>popiah</em> stalls where they have mantis
prawn <em>popiah</em>. So, I will put that on top and then I would have
crab meat and homemade chili sauce on the side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So a really, really deluxe <em>pie tee</em> filling. And then I would use
an American mould to get extra big <em>pie tee</em> cups.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>I think – I fear – Christopher that you’ve just invited a <em>popiah</em> party
at your house where people would have very, very high expectations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>You did say a dream filling. So, you know, it may never become reality,
but here’s hoping.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Okay, what’s the one dish you wish you could master or you would like
to master?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p><em>Aiyo</em>, where to start <em>lah</em>? You know, it’s very funny,
but every few years, my mind will latch onto something, and will get obsessed
with a dish. And one of those, in fact, was <em>kueh ambon</em>, which is
on the cover of my new book. Which took me 10, 15 years to really get a
handle on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>Yeah. It’s a very finicky <em>kueh</em> to make. Okay. The full recipe’s
in my book, <em><a href="https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/redir/itemdetails?bid=203962932" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">The Way of Kueh</a></em>,
but that recipe took me over 10 years to perfect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>Or to refine, I should say.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But what is left out there for me to master that I really want to get
a handle on? I mean, there are too many to choose just one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>How about something, something local, or baking related?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>Again, too many, so many. I think I’d like to get more into rye bread.
Like the very hearty and complex rye breads that you find in Scandinavia
and very dense in the sort of region between China and Russia. There are
very interesting sorts of Eastern European/Asian-style rye breads. So that’s
something that you need a lot of time [for] and you need very specific
ingredients. So that’s something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Do you, like Suzy Hing, test your recipes on your family? Are they the
guinea pigs for all your dishes?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>I’m sure some of them might say I inflict my recipes on them, but obviously
if I am post-mortem-ing and sticking my fingers into things, I don’t give
them to people to taste. But if I have leftovers from my recipe testing,
I do usually give them to family and friends. And to anyone who might be
listening and might want to leave a comment on my Instagram asking for
a taste, sorry you’ll have to take a number. A lot of people ask me that.
I never like to give someone something until I’m at least 80 percent happy
with it, right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Of course. What’s the one thing you would rather buy than cook on your
own?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>Really, really good ice-cream? My kitchen is too hot. Even with an ice-cream
maker, my kitchen is too hot to make ice-cream. So, I would gladly shell
out for really good ice-cream.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>And also, kimchi. I don’t have the space and I don’t have the necessary
ambient temperatures in my kitchen to make good kimchi on my own. But,
you know, anyone who’s been to Korea and has had really good artisanal
kimchi that is still alive and fizzy when you eat, will know what I’m talking
about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like good, fresh, gut-enhancing kimchi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Because this is audio you cannot see the look on my face when he said
fizzy kimchi and the look of horror.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>No, really, when you bite into it right there’s a slight little effervescence
almost like champagne.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>And the kind of very complex aftertaste and aroma nuances you get from
a properly made, well-made kimchi is unlike, you know, all those pre-packaged
kimchi that you see in the supermarkets. They’re functionally dead because
they’ve been on the shelf for too long. Yeah, all the microbes are dormant.
You won’t get this. But once you taste the real thing, it’s very easy to
get converted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>On my next trip to Korea, that's what I shall look for. Fizzy kimchi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Complete the sentence. Food is...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>Love.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Okay, but explain why. I mean, food is love. Why?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher</strong>
</p>
<p>You know, as we mentioned earlier, food is a very concrete way of expressing
your love for someone. By cooking for them, by serving something to them
that you’ve made with your own two hands and that you’ve made with the
knowledge of what they like and what they enjoy and what floats their boat,
you know, to cook for someone is, to me, really one of the ultimate expressions
of showing your devotion to them and showing your appreciation of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, you know, it’s a trope that Asian parents show their love to their
kids, not by saying so, but by cutting fruit for them or cooking meals
for them. You know, and it’s a trope, but it’s also a truth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
