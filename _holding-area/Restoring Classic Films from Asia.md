Since it was established about two decades ago, the Asian Film Archive (AFA) has restored many films connected to Singapore. These include classic titles from the golden age of Malay cinema such as K.M. Basker’s _Patah Hati_ (1952) and Hussein Haniff’s _Dang Anom_ (1962) to more recent Singapore movies like _Mee Pok Man_ (1995) and _Money No Enough_ (1998). However, as the name of the organisation implies, the AFA has also been active in restoring films from around the region. In 2005, when the archive was founded, director Mike De Leon became the first Filipino filmmaker to donate his works to the AFA for preservation.

An eminent filmmaker of the second golden age of Philippine cinema from the 1970s to early 1980s, De Leon’s films arrived at the AFA in a variety of film formats that included 35 mm original picture and sound negatives, and De Leon’s own collection of surviving 35 mm exhibition prints.


#### **Mike De Leon’s Batch ’81**

In 2014, ABS-CBN Corporation, the largest media conglomerate of the Philippines, embarked on the first restorations of De Leon’s filmography beginning with _Hindi Nahahati ang Langit_ (_An Indivisible Heaven_, 1985) – about two stepsiblings who fall in love – using the negative it acquired. In 2015, ABS-CBN loaned from the AFA the 35 mm original camera and sound negatives of De Leon’s 1980 musical comedy _Kakabakaba Ka Ba_? (_Will Your Heart Beat Faster?_) and subsequently the surviving 35 mm release prints of the 1979 _Kung Mangarap Ka't Magising_ (_Moments in a Stolen Dream_), a coming-of-age romantic drama, for digitisation and restoration.&nbsp;

Both films were produced by LVN Pictures, one of the biggest film studios of Philippine cinema since its inception in 1938. The LVN studio ceased operations in 2005, and ABS-CBN Corporation acquired the assets to maintain the legacy of LVN Pictures and the films it made. The rights to De Leon’s other works belonged to either the director or multiple parties.

Considering and navigating the legal and copyright issues are essential in preparing for any film restoration. With the approval and support from the film’s executive producer Marichu Vera-Perez Maceda in 2016, the AFA assessed and determined the urgency to digitise and restore De Leon’s 1982 critically acclaimed _Alpha Kappa Omega Batch ’81_ (also known as _Batch ’81_ or _ΑΚΩ 81_).

Produced at a time of great political unrest and turmoil during the period of martial law in the Philippines (1972–86) under then President Ferdinand Marcos, the psychological film chronicles fraternity Alpha Kappa Omega’s brutal initiation of new members as seen through the eyes of university student Sid Lucero. The film has been often referred to as one of the greatest Filipino films of all time and a metaphor for the Philippines under the Marcos regime.[^1]

Using the original camera and sound negatives and a surviving positive print that had been preserved by the AFA since 2005, the film became the archive’s first restoration of a Filipino title. The original camera and sound negatives of _Batch ’81_ exhibited critical signs of “vinegar syndrome”, where films become brittle, shrink and emit an acidic odour. It had developed haloes and mould, with major green-hued defects on the emulsion. As a result, parts of the picture negative were unusable and the laboratory – L’Immagine Ritrovata in Bologna, Italy – overseeing the restoration had to integrate shots from the positive print during the process of digital restoration.

Manila, De Leon and the film’s original cinematographer, Rody Lacap, supervised the colour grading using the restored scans. The colour-corrected restored scans were then returned to L’Immagine Ritrovata to produce new negatives of the film. The entire restoration, including generating new 35 mm negatives and print, took nearly a year.

In September 2017, the restored _Batch ’81_ premiered at the Venice Classics section of the 74th Venice International Film Festival. I had the privilege of attending the festival for the first time and read an opening statement from Mike De Leon to the audience. After Venice, the film screened in Manila in October 2017 as the closing film of the QCinema Film Festival.[^2] In Singapore, the film was shown at the AFA’s annual restored film series, “Asian Restored Classics”, on 30 August 2018.[^3]

Launched in conjunction with the film’s restoration, the AFA published _Batch ’81: The Making of a Mike De Leon Film_ to document the history behind the making of the film.[^4] The publication was made possible with De Leon’s collection of related materials

#### **Garin Nugroho’s Surat Untuk Bidadari**

In 2019, as the work to restore _They Call Her… Cleopatra Wong_ got underway,[^5] the AFA was tackling another challenging restoration of an Indonesian film, _Surat Untuk Bidadari_ (_Letter to an Angel_, 1994). This is the second feature film of director Garin Nugroho, who is considered a pioneer for a new generation of Indonesian filmmakers of the 1990s.

The film is about Lewa, a boy who believes in an angel that looks after the earth. Having lost his mother early, Lewa writes to the angel for answers, but is frustrated by the lack of reply. The film is notable for being the first to be shot on Sumba, one of the islands in the Nusa Tenggara, stretching from Bali to Timor. It was one of the last bastions of pre-Hindu animism. Adapting a story banned under the administration of Suharto during the New Order (1966–98), the film depicts a traditional Indonesian society at odds with modernity.[^6]

The original film was never commercially released within the country but won critical acclaim overseas, including the Gold Prize at the Young Cinema Competition of the 1994 Tokyo International Film Festival and the Golden Charybdis (Best Feature Film) at the 1994 Taormina International Film Festival. It was screened at the Oldham Theatre on 8 September 2019 as part of the 2019 edition of “Asian Restored Classics”.[^7]
