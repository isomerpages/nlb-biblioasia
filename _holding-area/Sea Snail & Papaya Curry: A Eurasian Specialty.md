#### **Episode summary** ####
For MasterChef Singapore judge Damian D’Silva, sea snail and papaya curry – known in the Kristang language as <i>cari papair cung siput chupaku</i> –  is a dish that brings back fond memories of foraging at the beach and cooking with his grandfather.

Damian explains how seafood has been a traditional protein for the Kristang people as he whips up his favourite childhood dish, while Paddy the host tries his best to ensure the snails don’t make a break for it.
