#### Dance is a powerful form of communication. Odissi is often considered the oldest form of classical dance still surviving. Originating more than 2,000 years ago in India’s Orissa state, it evolved purely as a devotional dance form performed daily as part of temple rituals by highly trained dancers called Maharis.

Despite the age-old protest of two left feet,  when it comes down to it – who can resist the lure of dance? Whether it be a little shimmy to a song on the radio, a sudden urge to lift up your kids and twirl them around, or the more subtle thrill of watching some real pros hit the dance floor or take to the stage – dance has power.

Dance is a powerful form of communication. In fact, it is said that 90% or more of our communication is non-verbal which means that most of the time we are communicating through movement, and we understand this non-verbal language perhaps even more viscerally than words. So when it comes to us in a concentrated form, with intention, like dance often does – the meaning can be even more pronounced and its effect more profound.

Of course, much of dance is not at all spiritual or divine. Just like every other form of communication, dance can be used for many diverse purposes – as a narcissistic form of flirtation, as an escape from reality or as a way to release aggression – just think of headbangers with fists raised and pounding.

But not all dance is like this. It could be that we are drawn to dance because it can allow us to communicate in an entirely different way – a way that lets us transcend our mundane selves and reach out to something or someone higher, or even become that higher being for a while.

The notion of dance as a spiritual practice is nothing new but surprisingly, you do not necessarily have to become a whirling Dervish, or put yourself in a trance to seek out sacred dance. You can explore it right here in Singapore and at the library.

Perhaps the most direct way to delve into spiritual dance is to learn a traditional sacred or devotional dance form and perhaps the oldest dance form of this type on offer is Odissi Temple Dance.

#### **Odissi Temple Dance**
#### **What Is It?**

Odissi is often considered the oldest form of classical dance still surviving. Originating more than 2,000 years ago in India’s Orissa state, it rates a mention in the Natya Shastra, the world’s oldest surviving text on stagecraft. It evolved purely as a devotional dance form performed daily as part of temple ritual by highly trained dancers called Maharis who were attached to the temple complex. Odissi reached its pinnacle between the 12th–16th centuries AD before decline set in. The dance form faced extinction in the British colonial period when Maharis were banned from dancing, but in the wake of independence the dance form was painstakingly reconstructed from the remaining Maharis’ accounts, and from temple sculptures, paintings and manuscripts.
