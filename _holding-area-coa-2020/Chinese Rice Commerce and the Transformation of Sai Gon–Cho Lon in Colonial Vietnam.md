In the mid-19th century, as the French empire began to consolidate its
foothold in Southeast Asia, the Chinese rice trade became the cornerstone
of the colonial economy. On the back of this trade, the port city of Sài Gòn–
Chợ Lớn grew to become a major urban centre and international entrepot,
and by the late 19th century, Indochina was the third-largest global rice
exporter after British Burma and Siam.1 At the heart of this trade were
Chinese migrants, whose transnational mercantile networks provided the
financial scaffolding for French colonial capitalism. Christopher Goscha
characterises this thriving trade as a striking manifestation of “East Asian
modernity at work”, and asserts that along with alcohol monopoly and the
development of the colonial plantation system, “the rice trade constitutes one
of the most important components of the Vietnamese economy to this day”.2

Through the lens of the rice trade, this paper examines the confluence of
Chinese migration and diasporic capitalism in transforming Sài Gòn–Chợ
Lớn in the 1870s into a central trade emporium and prominent colonial
port city crucial to the development of French governance in Vietnam and
Southeast Asia at large. My research relies on both primary and secondary
materials in the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library at the National Library
of Singapore, especially the under-explored Singapore historical newspapers
in the NewspaperSG archive, which offers invaluable insights into southern
Vietnam and its Chinese communities. Eclectic information on the rice
trade and Chinese roles in it extracted from colonial Singapore–era
newspapers sheds new light on our understanding of the scope of this trade’s
influence and the close interactions between Franco-British imperial powers
and Chinese communities in the Nanyang diasporic network. Although the
relevant materials and accounts are relatively fragmented, they show the
presence of Chinese commercial activities and the urbanisation of southern
Vietnam at the height of European colonisation in the region, a testament
to the spread of the Chinese population and their importance as politicoeconomic
contributors across Southeast Asian port cities. Hence, these
sources are more than mere supplements to archival sources in Vietnamese
and French.

#### **A Sketch of Sài Gòn–Chợ Lớn’s Chinese Migration and Its Communities**

Chinese migration to Vietnam and participation in its economy are part of
a larger history of Sino-Vietnamese interaction, conflict and state-building
spanning centuries. In southern Vietnam, the first massive wave of Chinese
migrants came at the fall of the Ming dynasty in 1644. Groups of Ming
loyalists escaping persecution by the Manchu-ruled Qing dynasty settled
down in coastal areas of modern-day Vietnam, including Hội An, Qui
Nhơn, Sài Gòn and Hà Tiên. Under the Nguyễn lords’ open attitude towards
the refugees’ integration and their involvement in commercial trade, the
Chinese population in the south grew quickly, with a rough estimate of
30,000–40,000 people in total in southern Vietnam towards the end of the
18th century.3 These Chinese and their descendants were collectively referred to by the Sino-Vietnamese term, Minh Hương (明香; ming xiang in Chinese,
or literally “Ming incense”, in reference to their ancestry as Ming refugees).4

The fall of the Ming also saw the Chinese become increasingly intertwined
with imperial politics in southern Vietnam. In 1679, 3,000 Chinese
troops, led by two anti-Qing military generals, Trần Thượng Xuyên and
Dương Ngạn Địch, arrived at the central Vietnamese port of Tourane.
This coincided with Nguyễn Hoàng’s near-complete acquisition of the
southeastern and western Transbassac.5 When the two generals pledged
loyalty to the Nguyễn lord and asked for permission to take refuge in
southern Vietnam, they were welcomed with open arms, given the strategic
position of Cochinchina as a key commercial centre in a flourishing
maritime trade network and the Sino-Japanese-Vietnamese alliances from
which the Nguyễn clan drew its power.

In the early 18th century, a Chinese general-in-exile named Mạc Cửu
furthered Nguyễn Hoàng’s imperial ambitions through the conquest of Hà
Tiên, a key southernmost coastal town, at the expense of Cambodia, turning
it into a prosperous and profitable Chinese “colony”.6 Thus, well before the
Tây Sơn Uprising in 1771, Ming-loyalist Chinese had established themselves
in Cochinchina as powerful merchants, mariners, court officials and
military leaders who were accorded with political and economic privileges
that outpaced their Vietnamese counterparts. The fact that both sides of
the Tây Sơn rivalries (1771–1802) – Nguyễn Huệ’s forces and the Nguyễn
lord’s armies – relied heavily on Minh Hương attests to their critical role in
Southern imperial politics.7 The Minh Hương provided critical resources
and support to recruit soldiers and finance military operations.

While their identities became diluted towards the end of this conflict,
their status and influence as an institutionalised “bureaucratic-mercantile
‘minority elite’” did not cease with the new Nguyễn dynasty at the turn of
the 19th century.8 Emperor Gia Long (Nguyễn Ánh) allowed Minh Hương
to be registered as permanent settlers as opposed to itinerant merchants
or sojourners and continued to recognise them as an official minority
within the state. This enabled them to form distinct communities residing
in separate administrative units called Minh Hương Xã or Minh Hương
villages. Members of Minh Hương Xã, classed as ethnic Chinese, enjoyed
reduced taxes and access to official court positions, while being exempted
from mandatory military conscription and forced labour.9
