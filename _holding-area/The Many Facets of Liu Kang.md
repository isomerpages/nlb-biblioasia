#### **Liu Kang’s many roles as photographer, artist, educator and critic helped paint a new narrative for Singapore’s art history.**

In 1952, four Singapore artists – Chen Chong Swee, Chen Wen Hsi, Cheong Soo Pieng and Liu Kang – embarked on a two-month sketching trip to Java and Bali between 8 June and 28 July. Their aim was to experience and capture a cultural milieu, way of life and landscapes different from what they could find in Singapore. The following year, they presented a group exhibition of more than 100 paintings and sketches arising from the trip.[^1]

The exhibition was warmly received in Singapore when it opened to the public in November 1953. As the editor of _Nanyang Siang Pau_ observed, the crowds visiting the exhibition created a buzz at the otherwise sedate British Council.[^2] At his oral history interview in the 1980s, Chen Wen Hsi recalled with amusement the reception to the exhibition. “That exhibition broke new ground in Singapore. No one had done something like that before,” he said. “Someone called us the Four Master Painters, but we didn’t know how in the world that came about.”[^3]

The exhibition has since been described as a milestone in Singapore’s art history. The collective experience of the artists was seen as a beginning of a stylistic regionalism that was taking shape. These diasporic China-born artists, who were now in this region for the long haul, were attempting to evolve a new approach of visualisation (or representation) deploying their techniques to capture the indigenous cultural elements they encountered in the larger Southeast Asian environment.

Seven decades on, we are able to reimagine the trip and its artistic consequences in the exhibition at the National Library, _Untold Stories: Four Singapore Artists’ Quest for Inspiration in Bali 1952_. Presented in this exhibition are field photographs taken by Liu Kang, letters sent home during the trip, as well as some of the artworks presented in their Bali exhibition in 1953. _Untold Stories_ also provides an impetus for us to relook and rethink the many roles that Liu Kang had played in the art scene of Singapore spanning more than 60 years.

#### **The Accidental Documentation**
	
Photography was a skill Liu had acquired from around the age of 15, as he left Singapore to study in Shanghai.[^4] Thanks to the determination of Gretchen Liu, the daughter-in-law of the artist, Liu’s photographs have been sorted, progressively identified and published in a number of books. Despite Liu’s reluctance to recognise photography as an art form, his photographs are a treasure trove of art history.
