Wong Kar Wai’s *In the Mood for Love* (2000). David Lean’s *Lawrence of Arabia* (1962). Charlie Chaplin’s *Modern Times* (1936). Satyajit Ray’s *Pather Panchali* (1955). These are just a handful of canonical works by the auteurs of world cinema that have been digitally restored in the last 10 years.
