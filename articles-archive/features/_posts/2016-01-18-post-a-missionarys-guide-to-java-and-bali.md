Ironically, the earliest extant English publication to be printed in Singapore and held in the National Library’s collection – in 1830 to be exact – was not about Singapore but on Java and Bali. Written by the English Protestant missionary, Walter Henry Medhurst, whose primary aim was to spread Christianity to the local people, it turned out to be the earliest published account of the history and culture of Bali.

In August 1828, Medhurst left his post in Batavia (now Jakarta), Indonesia, and travelled to Singapore. His intention was to meet with two fellow missionaries, the Reverend Jacob Tomlim and Karl Friedrich August Gützlaff, and travel to Siam (Thailand) and the coast of China.

In Singapore, Medhurst boarded a Chinese junk and began a futile search in the Malay Peninsula for his friends. Disappointed, he gave up and sailed alone from Singapore to the island of Borneo, where he visited a number of Chinese settlements and proselytised to the local communities.

A year later, on 14 November 1829, Medhurst made a second sojourn from Batavia – this time in the happy company of Reverend Tomlim – to Surabaya in Java. There, they stayed several days with the Chinese residents as well as distributing Christian tracts and scriptures. The two men then sailed in a small native prow to Bali, studying the northern regions of the island, especially Baliling, the traditional centre of foreign contact and trade in Bali.1 After nine weeks of travel, Medhurst returned to Batavia on 24 January 1830.
