#### Lee Kong Chian Research Fellow _Oiyan Liu_ explores how movements of people, their thoughts and activities across Dutch-ruled Batavia, British-ruled Singapore and China were related to one another and how educational exchanges mutually shaped the political visions of diasporic Chinese.

<center><b><i> “I have observed that in the near future there will spring up one new<br> independent country, the Malay Peninsula, the Straits Settlements. The<br> masters of this new political division will certainly be Chinese … Now is the<br> time for you students to build up your political ability, because the future<br> masters of the Malay Peninsula are you students of this College.”</center></b></i>1

The above quote is an extract from Juin Li’s lecture entitled *Chinese Emigrants and their Political Ability* which was delivered at Jinan College in Nanjing, China, on 8 February 1922. Jinan, established in 1906, was the first institution for higher education that was especially opened for overseas Chinese. Functioning under China’s central government, the school aimed at integrating the Chinese from Southeast Asia and trained Nanyang Chinese to become agents who would then spread China’s political influence overseas. The school, which was established after the educational movements in the Dutch East Indies and British Malaya had been initiated, first approached advocates of the educational movement in Java for institutional integration. Soon thereafter, Jinan also started to recruit students from British Malaya, particularly Singapore.

In this essay, I seek to understand how movements of people, their thoughts and activities across Dutch-ruled Batavia (now Jakarta), British-ruled Singapore and China were related to one another. I analyse the circumstances under which these triangular relations intensified, and the conditions under which this process of integration weakened. More interestingly, I attempt to understand how educational exchanges mutually shaped the political visions of diasporic Chinese. This essay concentrates on the case of Batavia and examines how the educational movement of the Dutch East Indies Chinese was connected to the educational movements in Singapore and China.

#### **The Educational Movement in Batavia**

This quote is taken from the notes of L.H.W. van Sandick, an inspector at the Domestic Governance Department of the Dutch colonial government, who investigated essays that were written by students of the Tiong Hoa Hwee Koan school in Batavia. Dating back to 1909, this source reveals that during that period,
