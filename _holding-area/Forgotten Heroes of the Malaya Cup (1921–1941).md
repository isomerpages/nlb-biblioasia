#### We remember some legendary players of the interwar years who left an indelible mark on the local football scene. 
By Dr Nick Aplin

What does it take to become recognised as a hero in Singapore soccer? One answer is that you play for a successful team with talented teammates, and an extensive and supportive fan base. Maybe a player turned national coach. To be called a hero is very challenging indeed. Memories can fade. Names forgotten. Injuries intrude. And reputations suffer.

If you ask people today who their football heroes are, they are likely to cite people they have seen in action. Relying on this approach, however, means that we will miss out players from arguably the most important period in Singapore’s football history: the prewar period.

Singapore won the Malaya Cup (renamed Malaysia Cup in 1967) 12 times between 1921 (when the competition began) and 1941. A look at the results – focusing just on the home games played in the southern division of the Malaya Cup competition – shows that in 52 games, Singapore recorded an 82 percent win record, averaging four goals per game. Visiting teams managed less than one goal per game against the home side. Amazingly, throughout that span of 21 years, the Singapore team lost only two games at home. Singapore’s prewar record in the Malaya Cup definitely suggests that it was a major soccer powerhouse before the war.

#### **The Beginnings of the HMS Malaya Cup**

The game of association football (or football as it is better known today) was established in Singapore in 1889. Maritime or marine engineers, soldiers from the 58th Northamptonshire Regiment (known as the Steelbacks) and members of the Singapore Cricket Club (SCC) were the first devotees. By 1891, 30 years before the Malaya Cup began, interest in the sport had swelled considerably. There were 24 football teams recorded, including one each from the Straits Chinese Recreation Club (SCRC) and the Singapore Recreation Club (SRC). However, there was no official organising body for the game until the Singapore Football Association was established in 1892.1

The Malaya Cup was formed after Captain H.T. Buller of the HMS Malaya donated two silver challenge trophies for football and rugby.2 The battleship was visiting the region to acknowledge the contributions of Malayans to the war effort.3 It arrived in Singapore on 29 January 1921 via Port Swettenham (now Port Klang), and the crew played friendly football matches against the five teams in the Singapore Football Association League: the Staffordshire Regiment (Army), Singapore Chinese Football Association (SCFA), the SCC, the SRC and Sea Defences (troops manning the coastal defences).

Initially, expatriate military personnel in Singapore were permitted to play in the Malaya Cup, but this would last for one season only as it was felt that their inclusion would dominate the competition and limit local participation. After the 1921 competition, there were no representatives from the army or navy until 1932. Members of the SCC were selected in the early competitions, but gradually players from the SCFA, the Malayan Football Association and the SRC formed the backbone of the teams. The Malaya Cup became the preserve of Malay and Chinese players during the interwar period, with rare appearances by Eurasian and European civilian representatives.

#### **The Soccer Legends**

Any list of Singapore’s best footballers will be a subjective one of course. One yardstick for judging the best players in the period 1921–41 could be the number of appearances in a Malaya Cup final. For this piece, I’ve included only local players as heroes. This does not mean that members of the SCC and military personnel did not contribute to Singapore’s successes in the Malaya Cup. Based on the criteria above, we have the following names:.
