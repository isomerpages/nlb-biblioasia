#### **Introduction**
Amid the booming newspaper industry and active Chinese literary scene
in Singapore after the Second World War, two editors of newspaper literary
supplements stood out for their contributions: Xing Ying (杏影; 1911–67)
and Yao Zi (姚紫; 1920–82). The supplements under their editorship were
influential and informed local literary trends in the 1950s and 1960s.
Newspaper supplements played a significant role in promoting literature
and literary aesthetics and developing local literary talent, because they
were published more frequently than literary magazines and had a wider
audience.1 They typically appeared as a half-page section near the end of the
newspaper. For budding writers, these supplements served as a springboard
to the more prestigious literary magazines.2 The arts led to a paucity of reading materials4 and the dampening of the
literary scene.

At the same time, this sociopolitical environment gave rise to a cultural
phenomenon known as “yellow culture” (黄色文化). Yellow culture refers
to activities and behaviour perceived as degenerate, such as dance clubs,
gambling and pornography.5 In October 1953, in what was seen as a tragic
consequence of yellow culture, a 16-year-old girl was raped and killed
at Pearl’s Hill. A public outcry ensued. Cultural institutions, student
organisations and schools organised anti-yellow culture campaigns, and
students from Chinese schools such as Chung Cheng High School and
The Chinese High School initiated the slogan, “Resist yellow culture”
(抵制黄色文化). The anti-yellow culture movement (反黄运动) received
widespread public support.

The movement was another turning point in the development of
Chinese literature and newspapers in Singapore. New compositions such
as songs, dramas, novels and poems emerged, many of which stressed the
importance of a healthy mind,6 in opposition to the corrupting influence of
yellow culture. The number of literary works increased by 25 percent, from
113 before the anti-yellow culture campaign, to 142 in 1955.7 In the same
year, there were 414 Chinese newspapers and publications, more than twice
compared to 163 in the prewar period from 1837 to 1941.8

The vibrant Chinese literary and newspaper scene in the 1950s can be
attributed to three reasons. First, the British colonial government relaxed its editorship of *Wen Feng*, the literary supplement of *Nanyang Siang Pau*, in 1954. Not only was he successful in his journalism career, Xing Ying was a
good prose writer and wrote books such as *While You Are Young* (趁年轻的
时候, 1958), *Books and People* (书与人, 1960) and *Century of the Fools* (愚人的
世纪, 1960), etc. He also contributed regularly to the literary supplements,
*Lü Zhou* and *Shi Ji Lu*, both edited by Yao Zi. Xing Ying passed away in
1967 from illness at Singapore General Hospital at the age of 55.

Yao Zi, whose birth name was Zheng Meng Zhou (郑梦周), was born in
Fujian province, China. As a student, he edited a small newspaper, *Jiang Tao*
(江涛). He subsequently became an editor at *Jiang Sheng Daily* (江声日报)
in China, before coming to Singapore in 1947, where he taught at Tao Nan
School and Jin Jiang School. In 1949, his debut novel, *Miss Hideko* (秀子姑
娘), sold 16,000 copies in a single month; his subsequent novels in the 1950s
and 1960s, such as *The Lure of Coffee* (咖啡的诱惑) and *Storm* (风波), were
also popular. Yao Zi wrote under at least six different pen names in *Shi Ji
Lu*. He was an editor at *Nanfang Evening Post* (南方晚报) from 1952 to 1953,
*Nanyang Siang Pau* from 1953 to 1954, and *Shin Min Daily News* (新明日报)
from 1969 to 1977. Yao Zi passed away in 1982, at age 62.

#### **International Literature and Communication between Editors and Readers: *Lü Zhou* and *Wen Feng***
*Lü Zhou* and *Wen Feng*, edited by Yao Zi and Xing Ying respectively, are
considered the two early literary supplements of the 1950s. The two men had
different editorial philosophies. Yao Zi’s focus on literary aesthetics likely
stemmed from his literary values as a novelist, and under his editorship, *Lü Zhou* published both international and local literature. Xing Ying focused
on developing young writers, and with *Wen Feng*, he created a vibrant
supplement that allowed greater interaction between readers and the editor.
In *Lü Zhou* and *Wen Feng*, Yao Zi and Xing Ying honed their respective
editorial styles, which became amplified in their later supplements.

***Lü Zhou: Bringing Literary Aesthetics into the Nanyang Literary Scene***
Yao Zi was the editor of the literary supplement *Lü Zhou* in *Nanfang
Evening Post* from 15 November 1952 to 3 January 1953, editing a total of 33
issues. *Lü Zhou* published news on regional literature and introduced local
writers, including Xing Ying and Wei Bei Hua (威北华), both of whom later
became renowned writers and editors. *Lü Zhou* was Yao Zi’s first edited
local literary supplement. In his first editorial in 1952, he wrote with palpable *Lü Zhou* usually relied on a few good writers for regular contributions. One of these regulars was Wang Ge (王葛),15 a talented Malayan known
for his novels and essays. *Lü Zhou* published his novels16 such as *Mimosa*
(含羞草), *Sail* (帆) and *Fog* (雾), his
poem titled “Shell” (贝壳), and even
his translation of the English naturalist
Gilbert White’s 1789 essay on swallows.17
Several of the young regular contributors
later became important writers. For
instance, Zhao Xin (赵心), better known
as Zhao Rong (赵戎), contributed many
pieces of literary reviews and criticism,
and Xing Ying’s essays and novels written
under the pen name Li Qi appeared in
almost every issue of *Lü Zhou*.18

Yao Zi broadened the horizons of
local readers by introducing regional
and international literature in *Lü Zhou*.
A column was dedicated to poetry from
Indonesia (Figure 2); featured works
included “Vigil” (守夜), “A Lie” (欺瞒),
“Last Night” (昨夜) and “Palace” (王宫).19
The poems were chosen and translated
by Yue Zi Geng (越子耕), better known
by his other pen names, Wei Bei Hua the 1950s, this column exposed readers to developments in the worldwide
literary scene. Articles covered a wide range of events and topics, such as
“Belgium Issues Stamps Commemorating Writers” (比国发行作家纪念邮票),
“Venice Establishes Literary Award among Nine Countries” (威尼斯创立
九国文学奖), “Children’s Literature in Argentina” (阿根廷的儿童文学) and
“Puppets in Italy” (木偶人在意大利).26 The column also featured articles
on international writers and literary reviews, including “The Experience
of a Reporter cum Writer: François Mauriac” (新闻记者兼作家的莫里亚
克略经历), written by Di Jun,27 and a review, “Turgenev and His Works”
(屠格涅夫及其作品), by the Irish writer Robert Lynd and translated by
Yuan Si (原思). That the review was published in full over three issues of *Lü Zhou* was telling of the significance Yao Zi placed on the Russian writer.
“The works of Turgenev,” he wrote, “are among the greatest in modern
world literature.”28
