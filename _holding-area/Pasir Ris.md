Sun, sand, sea and sax – the popular Malay song “Bila Mama Pakai Celana” had it all. Set to a cha-cha beat, the song was written by actor, musician and filmmaker P. Ramlee and featured in the 1959 film _Saudagar Minyak Urat (Love Crazy)._

In the film, actor Aziz Sattar sings this song – whose title roughly translates as “When Mother Wore Pants” – on a beach surrounded by a bevy of ladies in swimsuits who are gyrating their hips as they twirl hula hoops. A saxophone dangles around his neck, which he holds occasionally but never seems to actually use.

Produced by the Shaw Brothers’ Malay Film Productions, this particular scene was shot on the grounds of a beachside hotel in Pasir Ris.[^1] The now largely forgotten Pasir Ris Hotel on Elias Road was owned by well-known hotelier Ho Meng Quee. Before he took over the place in the 1950s, the building had been the beachfront holiday residence of wealthy Jewish entrepreneur Joseph Aaron Elias, who was also a Justice of the Peace (he and his brother Ezra Aaron Elias gave Elias Road its name).[^2]

It is not surprising that the producers of this lightweight comedy would have chosen Pasir Ris to capture a laidback beach vibe. For much of Singapore’s postwar years, the white sands of Pasir Ris drew city folk looking for a quiet, peaceful respite. At one time, Pasir Ris boasted two seaside resorts and even had a museum of corals and seashells. Its remote location added to its allure, in the way that holidaymakers today seek out beach holidays in Bintan, Tioman and Phuket.

These days, Pasir Ris is no longer quite as quiet and remote. Over 100,000 people live in bustling Pasir Ris town, which is well connected to the rest of Singapore thanks to the MRT (it is a speedy 33-minute train ride from City Hall MRT station). Downtown East, which styles itself as a premier lifestyle, recreational and entertainment hub, draws large crowds on weekends and school holidays. And although it still boasts sandy beaches, if you mention “white sands”, you are more likely to be directed to the six-storey shopping mall next to Pasir Ris MRT station.

#### **An Idyllic Enclave**

One of the earliest mentions of Pasir Ris is in an 1844 map by John Turnbull Thomson, the Government Surveyor for the Straits Settlements. In that map, the area was labelled as Passeir Rice. Other 19th century maps use variant spellings such as Passir Ris and Passir Risa. Charles Burton Buckley’s 1902 book, _An Anecdotal History of Old Times in Singapore_, refers to the place as Passier Reis.[^3]

The origin of the name Pasir Ris is unknown though. According to a study by H.T. Haughton published in the _Journal of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society_ in 1889, the name could have been derived from a combination of the Malay words _pasir_ (sand) and _hiris_ (shred).[^4]

Pasir Ris was once a low-lying and undeveloped area.[^5] Maps from the 1950s to 1970s show that Pasir Ris was then occupied mainly by coconut and rubber plantations, mangrove swamps and ponds, and dotted with Malay kampongs and Chinese villages. The kampongs in the area included Kampong Loyang, Kampong Pasir Ris, Kampong Elias, Kampong Teban, Kampong Beremban and Kampong Sungei Blukar. Two waterways, Sungei Api Api and Sungei Tampines, used to flow through the area.[^6]

Apart from rubber tapping and fishing as their livelihoods, the Malay villagers also produced _belacan_ (fermented shrimp paste) made from _udang geragau_ (small shrimps) caught at Sungei Api Api and Sungei Tampines during high tide. Kampong Tampines, located on Jalan Guan Choon and Tampines Road, was a popular filming location in the 1950s and 1960s for Malay films such as _Hantu Jerangkong_ (_The Skeleton Ghost_), _Antara Dua Darjat_ (_Between Two Classes_) and _Batu Belah Batu Bertangkup_ (_The Devouring Rock_).[^7]

Interestingly, Pasir Ris was used as a film location very early on. In 1913, French filmmaker Gaston Méliès shot _The Poisoned Darts_ in the area. An advertisement that ran in _Moving Picture World_ magazine proudly proclaimed that it was “produced in the jungles of Passir Riz \[Pasir Ris\], a suburb of Singapore, Strait Settlements, Asia, employing natives in many of the roles”.[^8] Author and film director Raphaël Millet, who directed a documentary on Méliès, noted that based on the surviving footage of this film, the actors were most likely inhabitants of Malay villages in Pasir Ris.[^9]

#### **A Seaside Getaway**

Pasir Ris was known for its recreational amenities that attracted local holidaymakers and tourists. Pasir Ris Hotel, the location for the song “Bila Mama Pakai Celana” was a pioneer in beachfront development in Pasir Ris.[^10]

A _Straits Times_ advertisement on 16 May 1952 described the hotel as “Singapore’s Premier Pleasure Resort” that offered “the clearest, beautiful, palm-fringed beaches, swimming, boating and lawn tennis”. Officially opened on 17 May, the hotel comprised 35 fully furnished rooms fitted with modern sanitation, and provided amenities such as a dance hall, tennis courts and an enclosed swimming _pagar_ (fenced-in pool; _pagar_ means “fence” in Malay).[^11]

However, seven years later, the hotel was converted into a transit accommodation for the personnel of the British Royal Air Force and their families. Although the hotel subsequently reopened to the public in 1966, it never regained its former glory and struggled to attract guests.[^12]

In May 1971, _New Nation_ reporter Wendy Hutton described the hotel as a “faded gentlewoman, now reduced to taking in paying guests, who occasionally dreams of the days of her youth and beauty when young men sipped champagne from her dancing slippers”.[^13]

The hotel hung on for another decade before finally shuttering on 31 December 1983. Speaking to the _Straits Times_ that year, Robin Tan, the assistant front manager, recalled the hotel in its heyday. “I remember coming to this place when I was a little boy and seeing only _ang mohs_ (Caucasians) around. It was very exclusive, somewhat like the Singapore Cricket Club. And the sea came right up to the hotel’s doorsteps.”[^14]

The nearby Golden Palace Holiday Resort, which opened in 1969, was another popular spot for holidaymakers. The 20-acre resort at the now-expunged Jalan Ang Siang Kong off Tampines Road was touted as an “ideal retreat for fishing, boating, picnics and parties” with a “beautiful panoramic scenery”. It had chalets, pavilions, restaurants and a nightclub. One of the resort’s key offerings was its boating and fishing pond, which was once a sand quarry.[^15] According to Pasir Ris resident Law Yap Teck, who visited the resort when he was in his 20s, “\[it\] was a place where people came for an eye-opening experience. To have fun, row boats and stay in the holiday resort”.[^16]

The resort wound up in 1971 after a petition by one of the directors over alleged mismanagement by the company’s chairman. In 1973, the government acquired the resort for $870,000, with plans for it to be used for fish-breeding experiments. Today, the resort’s former site forms part of Pasir Ris Park. The pond was converted into a commercial saltwater fishing pond, which opened to the public in October 1990.[^17]

While Pasir Ris Hotel and Golden Palace Holiday Resort targeted a more affluent clientele, the People’s Association Holiday Flats offered affordable rentals that became popular among local families. A three-storey block comprising 30 holiday flats was officially opened by then Minister for the Environment Lim Kim San on 11 November 1973.[^18]

These flats were intended to serve the “average wage-earners” and provide a beach holiday “at a cost within their means”. The daily rate was $7 for a two-room unit and $10 for a three-room unit. Each flat came with a living and dining room, and kitchen facilities.[^19] Noraini Anastasi, who stayed there in 1988, recalled that “\[t\]he seaside scenery is super. My only complaint: mosquitoes. We should have brought mosquito coils but, alamak, we forgot”.[^20]

In addition to the holiday flats, the People’s Association built a sea sports centre to cater to water sports enthusiasts. The Pasir Ris Sea Sports Centre on Elias Road opened in August 1987 “for Singaporeans who love the sun-and-sea type of sports”. Today, the centre is known as PAssion WaVe @ Pasir Ris and offers activities such as dinghy sailing, kayaking, abseiling and sports climbing.[^21]

With its proximity to the sea, water skiing was a popular sport in Pasir Ris back in the day. In February 1955, Pasir Ris Hotel hosted the Malayan Waterski Association’s first water skiing gala, which saw the construction of a 30-foot-long wooden ramp raised four feet above the water. The hundreds of spectators were entertained by the “spectacular tumbles” from the contestants. Pasir Ris was chosen “because it is safe for families to bring along children and also because there is plenty of parking space”, according to the event spokesperson, A.C. Cooper.[^22]

From the late 1960s to 1970s, Pasir Ris was also home to two tourist attractions – Villa Saujana and Dari Laut – located at Jalan Loyang Besar. Dari Laut, which means “from the sea” in Malay, was a museum showcasing 10,000 species of corals, seashells, fishes and other wildlife specimens.

Founded by beachcomber Johnny Johnson and marine enthusiasts John Langham and Jack Fisher, the museum was officially opened by then Finance Minister Goh Keng Swee in December 1969. It was initially accessible only to American troops on rest and recreation here from Vietnam. When the programme ceased a couple of years later, Dari Laut was opened to all tourists. Johnson eventually closed the museum and went on to supervise the establishment of the Coralarium at Sentosa with Fisher in 1974.[^23]

Dari Laut’s neighbour was Villa Saujana, the seaside residence of Englishman Ernest Smith, who was the former assistant manager at Raffles Hotel. (“Saujana” is a variation of _suasana_, Malay for “pleasant environment and view”.) Smith had opened his home, which had a Malay kampong atmosphere, to tourists at $30 a head, inclusive of dinner, cultural shows and drinks. In the early 1970s, Villa Saujana was said to be one of the top tourist attractions in Singapore.[^24]

#### **A Park for All**

In 1956, the Singapore Rural Board announced plans to develop 14.5 acres of land in Pasir Ris to provide more facilities for beachgoers. The plan included clearing coconut trees; building an access road, changing rooms and shower facilities; and repairing the seawall. Works were completed in 1958, and Pasir Ris beach park was officially opened on 17 August 1958 by then Chief Minister Lim Yew Hock.[^25]

From the late 1970s, Pasir Ris beach underwent further developments, which included 44 hectares of land reclamation. Landscape and park specialists from Japan were engaged to develop the park. It would have a pond, flower gardens, jogging and cycling tracks, an area for nature walks and boating, a camp site, chalets, a children’s playground, cafeterias and a sports complex.[^26]

In 1984, the Parks and Recreation Department (today’s National Parks Board) embarked on a project to build an 80-hectare regional park stretching from Pasir Ris beach park to Sungei Loyang, making it the second-biggest park in Singapore after East Coast Park.[^27]

Today, the 70-hectare park – which stretches over 3.2 kilometres – provides pony rides, bicycle and barbecue pit rentals, camping sites and water sports facilities. A highlight of the park is the preserved mangrove forest with a mangrove boardwalk and a three-storey tower for birdwatching.[^28]

Nature lovers can also visit Lorong Halus Wetland, a former landfill along the eastern bank of Serangoon Reservoir. Officially opened in March 2011, the wetland protects the reservoir water from contaminants caused by landfill waste. Spanning Serangoon Reservoir is the Lorong Halus Red Bridge, a great place to catch the sunset and popular with Instagrammers.[^29]

#### **A Residential Town**

One of the earliest housing developments in Pasir Ris was the 57-hectare Pasir Ris Beach Park Estate. The private residential area, developed by property developer Kong Joo in the early 1970s, comprised 328 bungalows, semi-detached houses and terrace houses located near the former Pasir Ris Hotel site. Residents likened it to living in a kampong, and even harvested shrimps from the sea to make their own _belacan_ and _cincalok_ (fermented shrimp product).30

Happy Tay, president of the Pasir Ris Beach Park Residents’ Association, told the _Straits Times_ in 1988: “The atmosphere in this place is just like a kampung. Even if there is a disagreement, we try to solve it in a friendly manner and no one takes offence if we point out their mistakes. And people genuinely like to help each other.”31 Several of these houses today are owned by the government and private corporations as holiday bungalows for their employees.32

The Housing and Development Board (HDB) announced plans for the development of Pasir Ris New Town in its 1984/85 annual report, with construction slated to begin in 1986. The government had acquired land to build the new housing estate from Bukit Sembawang Rubber Company, Shaw Brothers and a number of private individuals in 1983. To attract potential buyers to the far-flung location, the HDB highlighted amenities such as the MRT system that would take residents to Orchard Road in 30 minutes and the new Pasir Ris Park. “Better-quality flats with better finish and better designs” in Pasir Ris were also cited to boost the estate’s appeal.33
