The skeleton of a blue whale was once the centrepiece of the former Raffles Museum. The skeleton was gifted to the National Museum of Malaysia in 1974. 

Another whale skeleton, that of an adult female sperm whale, is currently on display at the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum. The whale carcass was found drifting off the coast of Jurong Island in July 2015.

<style>.embed-container {position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class="embed-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eM1aWlQUvvo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

Professor Yu Chun Yee previously taught at the Royal College of Music in London. At age 18, he won the prestigious Singapore Musical Society’s pianoforte competition in 1955 judged by Julius Katchen. Here, Yu plays on the recently [refurbished Chappell grand](https://biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg/vol-19/issue-3/oct-dec-2023/chappell-piano-repair-zhivko-girginov/) once used by international pianists at the Victoria Memorial Hall. A cheaper replacement for the Memorial Hall’s old Steinway grand, the piano has a [chequered history](https://biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg/vol-19/issue-3/oct-dec-2023/chappell-steinway-piano/) and was widely criticised for its tone. It is now a public piano at the National Library Building.
