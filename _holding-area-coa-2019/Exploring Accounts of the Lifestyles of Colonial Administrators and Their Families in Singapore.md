#### **Introduction**

In 1900, British traveller and sometime political activist Ethel Colquhoun
visited Singapore during a tour of the Pacific with her husband, an imperial
administrator and explorer. During a stay of several days, she recorded
her views on the landscape and society that she observed. One of the
most striking and critical passages of her account deals with Singapore’s
European residents:


  *They live in the baleful atmosphere of a hothouse. They are exiles<br> 
  and prisoners on a cramped little island, from which they cannot<br> 
  even escape for a short holiday at times, only to go “home”. They<br> 
  naturally get to regard Singapore as the hub of the universe, and<br> 
  to feel as if the whole creation centred round their tiny world of<br> 
  small civil, military and mercantile duties. They can’t exercise<br> 
  charity to their poorer neighbours – for neither Chinese nor Malays<br>  are exactly subjects for my Lady Bountiful – so that it is not<br>  perhaps wonderful that that much-abused virtue gets rusty in their<br>    intercourse with social equals*.1

Throughout the period 1870–1920, during which Singapore was
administered as part of the Crown Colony of the Straits Settlements within
the British Empire, visitors and residents were keen to record their thoughts
on the island’s European community. While some accounts were written
by travellers passing through, others recorded the experiences of men and
women who had spent longer periods living and working in British Malaya.

Colquhoun’s comments reflect several key themes that appear throughout
many contemporary accounts. Discussions of the nature of society are
rooted in ideas of separation and isolation, the relationship with Britain as
“home”, and interactions between racial and occupational groups. While
many accounts follow Colquhoun’s lead and criticise the way of life they
observe among the European population, others present a more favourable
view, highlighting the perceived benefits of a tropical lifestyle, the strengths
of the small European community in Singapore and what they believed
were improvements to the outlook and living conditions of Chinese,
Malays and Indians as a result of “the presence of English law and…the
protection of the British flag”.2 While an individual’s views are to an extent
attributable to personal experience, position and perspective, there are wider
themes and ideas relating to the ideologies that structured late 19th- and
early 20th-century colonial society, which are important to consider when
exploring these accounts and the views their authors express.
#### **Source Material**


The Lee Kong Chian Reference Library and the National Archives of
Singapore hold an array of English-language material recounting the
experiences and attitudes of British colonial administrators and their
families during time spent in Singapore, and the Straits Settlements and
British Malaya more widely. The material held in Singapore institutions
takes a variety of forms, from published travellers’ accounts and semiautobiographical
prose produced by members of the island’s European
community, to original and facsimile copies of letters and diaries.
Newspapers and magazines – ranging from broadsheets such as *The Straits
Times* to the satirical *Straits Produce* – record the activities and concerns of Europeans who lived on the island and their relationship to wider regional and international affairs, while official records including census data, the *Civil Service List* and the *Blue Book* further outline the structure and boundaries placed upon the administrative community.3 These texts provide a valuable supplement to existing work on the peopling of the British Empire and the creation of settler communities and identities, much of which focuses on British India, and is interested in governors at the top of the imperial hierarchy, or relies upon official documents held in archives in the United Kingdom.

#### **The Colonial Administration in Singapore c. 1870–1920**

  *It is an article of popular belief that Englishmen are born sailors;<br>    probably it would be more true to say that they are born administrators*.<br> 
  – Frank Swettenham, 19074

British colonial administrators and their families were one small yet significant part of the European population that resided Singapore in the 19th and 20th centuries and were frequently the subject of accounts by residents and visitors. The 1881 census indicates 2,769 European men, women and children as residents in Singapore, of whom 862 were described as “British”. By 1910, the number of British inhabitants had increased to 1,870. However, in a total population of over 228,000, this category still represented less than one percent.

Within this category, an even smaller number made up the “administrative class”, those who were employed as civil servants within government departments. The 1881 Straits Settlement Census gives a figure of 84 Europeans and Americans serving in the civil service in Singapore, out of a total population of 139,208.5

While it remained common for those in the upper ranks of the administration to enter from roles elsewhere in the British Empire, the armyor, less commonly, the home administration, a professional colonial civil service ethos and local identity developed within Malaya in the aftermath of the establishment of the Straits Settlements as a Crown Colony in 1867. Young cadets were recruited through an increasingly formalised system of examination. The nature of this appointment system and the general esprit de corps that permeated the colonial civil service meant that many of the men fit a similar profile, having been raised in the British middle class and educated in British public schools and leading universities.6 

In 1904, the introduction of a colour bar restricted recruitment to the Malayan Civil Service to those of “pure European descent”, although the number of non-whites who had held positions in the civil service or commissioned roles in the police before that date had always been small.7

While women were not appointed to positions within the colonial administration during this period, the white female presence in Singapore grew slowly both as a result of an increasing number of nurses and teachers sent into the imperial sphere, and an acknowledgement that it was acceptable and indeed desirable for wives to accompany their administrator husbands to the Empire.8 Although they continued to be outnumbered considerably by men, there were 1,620 white women recorded in Singapore in the 1911 census, in contrast to 495 European and American women and girls recorded in 1881.9

Although a small population, the nature of imperial power vested these women with significance and the ability to shape society. While valuable work has been done to highlight the voices of other groups in colonial Singapore who have historically been silenced,10 the archival footprint of the men, women and children whose presence in Singapore was tied to the administration of the imperial state allows their lives to be subject to continued analysis.

#### **Imperial Careering**

The concept of “imperial careering” is a useful analytical framework that can be used to explore the time administrators spent in Singapore and how their occupations shaped the way they saw their lives there. It highlights how individuals’ lives and careers were influenced by their movement within and across imperial space, and how these movements formed part of the interwoven networks and stories that invested these spaces and the people who occupied them with specific identities.11

Framing lifestyles with reference to careers is particularly relevant to colonial Singapore due to the belief expressed in contemporary sources that no man should move to the island without a job, both for their own sake and to preserve the prestige of the wider white community.12 For new arrivals, colleagues replaced the networks of friends and family they had left behind in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. The close link between occupation and European presence in Singapore is underscored by the fact that it was rare for administrators to remain in Malaya after their careers had ended, even if they had spent the bulk of their lives there. In 1881, the total number of British residents over the age of 60 in Singapore was no more than 22.13

The *Straits Settlements Civil Service List*, produced annually from the 1880s, presents the names, educational backgrounds and career paths of every individual who joined the administrative service, from newly recruited cadets to the governor. These texts enabled residents and visitors to gain an
understanding of the individuals who made up administrative society and to relate themselves into the hierarchy outlined.14 They can also be used to track the experiences that created individuals’ imperial careers and cross-referenced with other sources, such as newspapers or private correspondence.

#### **Lives Within and Across Imperial Space**

Two case studies highlight how the source material can be used to reconstruct the role that Singapore played within an individual’s career and allow us to attempt to reconstruct how this may have impacted the sense of place and the networks in which they were situated.

Frank Kershaw Wilson came to Singapore in 1914 as an administrative cadet. From January 1915 to December 1916, he wrote regularly to his parents in the United Kingdom – copies of these letters are held as microfilm in the collection of the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library, Singapore.15 Cross-referencing these letters with Kershaw Wilson’s career recorded in the annual *Civil Service List* creates a picture of his career and the part that Singapore played within this. Over a period of more than 25 years in British Malaya, he was posted to eight different locations, spanning the Straits Settlements and the Federated and Unfederated Malay States with no clear regional “base” to which he returned over the course of his career.

In his letters, Kershaw Wilson appears to view his time and early career in Singapore with a sense of frustration. He expresses eagerness for the day that he is relocated upcountry and given the increased workload and responsibility that he yearns for, and laments the costs associated with maintaining the lifestyle required to participate within Singapore’s particular urban society.16

Mapping his career also highlights that alongside his conception of himself within a broader Malayan imperial space, his career is firmly rooted in relation to Britain as “home”. Though his visits to the United Kingdom were infrequent, they were associated with significant events such as promotions, relocations and even his marriage in the late 1920s, as well as being the site of his eventual retirement. It is possible thus to view his career in Malaya as developing within a specific local context framed by movement and the development of particular skills and knowledge, but also mediated by this continued relationship with and dependence on networks of connection to the United Kingdom.

A comparable example of a life spent within imperial space can be seen in an examination of the career of Walter Cecil Michell, who was recruited as a cadet in the Straits Settlements Civil Service in 1887, after completing his undergraduate degree at the University of Oxford. Michell was based in Malaya until his retirement in 1919. His obituary, published in Singapore newspapers in 1939, provides several interesting elements that can be related to considerations of his life and career.17 As with Kershaw Wilson, Michell was posted to a range of locations within Malaya during his career, spending only a short period in Singapore. Despite this, and the fact that he had retired from the Malayan administration two decades earlier, his death was reported in the Singapore press, suggesting he remained part of the community there in some way, despite a gap across space and time. Indeed, that Michell and his wife were living in the south of France when he died rather than in the British metropole acts as a reminder that not all networks tied an individual back to the country that they had originally come from. 

The next generation of the Michell family also continued to operate within multiple networks across space and community. Michell’s daughter Stella,
who was born in Singapore in 1902, features in a two-page spread in the
1907–8 edition of *The Straits Times Annual*, which showcased the offspring
of some of Singapore’s European residents under the heading “Children of
the Empire”. By the age of eight, Stella had been sent back to Britain for
schooling and never again lived in Singapore.18 Despite this, however, her
identity remained tied to the place she was born and the imperial project
that her family contributed to. Several episodes in her life, including her
1937 marriage in France and subsequent commitment to public service as the
wife of a colonel in the British army, were reported in the Singapore press.
Stella remained a child of this imperial community despite her family’s
residence in Singapore having ceased several decades earlier.19

The mobility associated with an imperial career outlined in the above 
examples appears at odds with Colquhoun’s view of Europeans in Singapore
as existing within “a cramped little island”. However, this is an idea that
prevails in several accounts of both residents and visitors. The lethargy often
presented as a defining feature of life for white inhabitants is frequently
linked to references to the position of these men and women far from their friends and families, struggling against the climate and lacking intellectual pursuits.20 An obsession with the coming and going of the mail is a motif often evoked to demonstrate the dependence upon any interaction with the wider world to infuse the community with vitality.21 A contrast thus appears to exist between the long-term, career-spanning movement and networks, and shorter-term feelings of isolation and stagnation.

Studying the sources highlights the existence of networks within and across imperial space that were more complex than simply ties linking points on the periphery back to the metropole and invested Singapore with a particular regional as well as global identity. An 1898 description of Singapore as the “capital of a little Empire” has implications for how we can understand Singapore within a system that did not require constant links to the metropole for its identity and place in the world.22 While there were significant differences between the institutions and norms that governed life in Malaya’s urban centres and the rural upcountry, the nature of imperial careering as presented earlier ensured that it was unheard of for an administrator to spend the entirety of his life in Malaya within one of these social formations.23 The ways that individuals related to Singapore specifically and as part of a wider British Malayan space were often complex and contradictory, illustrating the idea that there were multiple identities and imagined communities that could be drawn upon at particular times.24

It has already been mentioned that Kershaw Wilson perceived his time in Singapore as a precursor to his career proper in upcountry Malaya, while when reflecting back on his time in Malaya, former planter Robert Bruce
Lockhart stated that “to me, Singapore has never been more than an exotic
island. I was an FMS man”.25 However, for others, Singapore functioned as
an important reference point and mediatory that anchored their lives and
careers. Emily Innes, the wife of a colonial administrator who spent time in
Malaya during the 1870s and 80s, took joy in the opportunities presented to
her to escape the isolation of her life with trips to vibrant, busy Singapore.26
Similarly, three decades later, Margaret Birch escaped from her life in Perak
to visit Singapore to shop, visit friends and attend social events such as balls
and the races.27 Singapore was often the place where administrators first
landed to take up posts elsewhere in British Malaya, greeted by recognisable
institutions under the protection of the Union Jack; it may have been
a place where men and women were sent to temporarily recuperate or
prepare to leave the tropics for health reasons; it was frequently the site of
significant life events such as marriages and births; and it was where British
administrators and their wives were sent for dealings with senior judicial or
administrative powers.28

For those who spent longer periods residing in Singapore, improved
communications over the course of the late 19th and early 20th centuries
ensured that at times, the settlement felt more like a British town than an
island thousands of miles from London.29 It was possible to receive weekly
letters and business papers from home even in the midst of the disruption
of the First World War, while advice given in guidebooks aimed at British
men and women relocating to tropical parts of the Empire stress that it was possible, and indeed important, to keep up with the latest British fashions and styles.30 Not only letters, but goods and people were constantly sent across the world, connecting Singapore to elsewhere in Malaya, the United Kingdom and beyond. The fact that many of the middle-class travellers, whose accounts are preserved in the collections of the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library, were able to call on and interact with existing friends, families and social networks upon their arrival in Singapore highlights how the feelings both of isolation and connection to “home” were frequently tested and reinforced by ongoing patterns of movement.31

#### **A Structured and Controlled Social World**

The “tiny world” of European society in Singapore created a particular social milieu which was frequently commented upon in the writings of those who observed or participated within it. In his account of an 1899 visit to Singapore, Walter del Mar laid out some of the tensions that existed within such a society:

  *In small communities of Europeans, settled in the midst of<br>   another race with which there is practically no social intercourse,<br>   the individuals become closely united by ties of friendship and<br>   intimacy as well as by interest and for mutual protection…[they]<br>   assume with little friction the rank in the social scale to which they<br>   are entitled…everybody is “somebody” down to the club inebriate<br>   who is drinking himself to death…*.32
