title: "On the Waterfront: The Making of Singapore’s First High rise Skyline,
  1918–1928"

description: The town of Singapore and its architecture had always attracted
  attention. Even in the earliest days of the Settlement, visitors regularly
  commented on the fine buildings along the Esplanade, the neat and orderly
  streets and tree-lined thoroughfares, and the grand colonial-style residences
  of the European and Asian elites. From the outset, the progress of the town
  and its architectural landmarks were seen, quite rightly, as a reflection of
  the colony’s prosperity.
