#### _Kwa Chong Guan_ from the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies remembers the legacy, contributions, and impact of Dr Goh Keng Swee.

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong declared in his eulogy at the state funeral for Dr Goh Keng Swee that “Dr Goh was one of our nation’s founding fathers.… A whole generation of Singaporeans has grown up enjoying the fruits of growth and prosperity, because one of our ablest sons decided to fight for Singapore’s independence, progress and future.” How do we remember a founding father of a nation? Dr Goh Keng Swee left a lasting impression on everyone he encountered. But more importantly, he changed the lives of many who worked alongside him and in his public career initiated policies that have fundamentally shaped the destiny of Singapore.

Our primary memories of Dr Goh will be through an awareness and understanding of the post-World War II anti-colonialist and nationalist struggle for independence in which Dr Goh played a key, if backstage, role until 1959. Thereafter, Dr Goh is remembered as the country’s economic and social architect as well as its defence strategist and one of Lee Kuan Yew’s ablest and most trusted lieutenants in our narrating of what has come to be recognised as “The Singapore Story”. Dr Goh’s place in our writing of our history will in larger part have to be based on the public records and reports tracing the path of his career.

As a public figure, Dr Goh has left behind an extensive public record of the many policies which he initiated and that have moulded present-day Singapore. But how did he himself wish to be remembered? Publicly Dr Goh displayed no apparent interest in how history would remember him, as he was more concerned with getting things done. Moreover, unlike many other public figures in Britain, the United States or China, Dr Goh left no memoirs. However, contained within his speeches and interviews are insights into how he wished to be remembered.

The deepest recollections about Dr Goh must be the personal memories of those who had the opportunity to interact with him. At the core of these select few are the members of his immediate and extended family.

In contrast to their personal memories of Dr Goh as a family man are the more public reminiscences of his friends and colleagues. Many of these memories have become part of the social memory of the institutions that Dr Goh was at the helm of during the course of his career in public service.

#### **From The Open Public Records**

Dr Goh’s public career is amply documented in the open public records. His accomplishments after assuming office as Singapore’s first Minister for Finance in 1959 were also recorded comprehensively. His pronouncements as a Member of Parliament for Kreta Ayer Constituency from 1959 to 1984 are contained in Hansard. His policy statements during his various tenures as Minister of Finance, Defence and Education are necessary reading for an appreciation of Dr Goh’s analyses of the challenges he perceived as the Cabinet papers that were tabled in his name or which he initiated. A deeper understanding of Dr Goh’s role as a major policy maker who shaped post-1965 Singapore would be possible if these very significant Cabinet memoranda were to be declassified and made available for public consultation.

In the absence of any indication that the archival records of the major policy decisions and their implementation are being made public, we are left with only the recollections of those who helped Dr Goh draft these memoranda or who were at the receiving end of his file notes and minutes. S. Dhanabalan recalls one such memorandum that he was involved in drafting in 1960 when he was a rookie at the Singapore Industrial Promotion Board (SIPB). Dr Goh had assigned him the task of drafting the covering memorandum to seek Cabinet approval for the establishment of an “Economic Development Board”, as Dr Goh coined it. As Dhanabalan recalls, 

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“I spent an entire evening at home thinking about and<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;drafting out the paper. It set out compelling arguments to<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;explain the economic rationale for industrialisation and<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;for the establishment of the EDB and what it would do.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The paper came up to four glorious pages. I was proud of<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;my draft and felt that this would be a historic document<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;since it would mark an important milestone in Singapore’s<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;history. I then sent the paper to Dr Goh for clearance.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;When the paper got back to me, I discovered that Dr Goh<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;had crossed out the entire first part of my masterpiece.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;That was why the paper began rather abruptly with the<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;words: ‘The EDB shall ...” 1
