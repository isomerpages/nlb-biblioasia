Betel chewing is a time-honoured practice in Southeast Asia although the custom has mostly
died out here. In our cover story, [Fiona Lim and Geoffrey Pakiam](/vol-16/issue-3/oct-dec-2020/betel-chewing) explore various aspects of the betel quid. Years ago, I remember asking my husband’s late aunt to make a quid for me to try
but she refused, saying that it would be too intoxicating.

Those intoxicating effects are nowhere near as dangerous as opium smoking. Yet, about a century ago, partaking of this opiate was so prevalent among the Chinese coolie community
that it made up half of the colonial government’s annual tax takings. [Diana S. Kim](/vol-16/issue-3/oct-dec-2020/opium-revenue) explains how the colony ended its dependence on opium revenue.

Violent gun crime also used to be common in Singapore; up until the 1960s, street shootouts
and kidnappings of millionaires were regular occurrences. [Tan Chui Hua’s](/vol-16/issue-3/oct-dec-2020/gunpoint) account of the city’s gun-happy gangsters is a reminder that the “good old days” weren’t always so good.

On a less violent note, this year is the centenary of former French Prime Minister Georges
Clemenceau’s visit here and the 50th anniversary of the opening of Queenstown Library. [Lim
Tin Seng](/vol-16/issue-3/oct-dec-2020/tiger) revisits 1920 while [Paddy Jonathan Ong](/vol-16/issue-3/oct-dec-2020/queenstown) recounts the history of Singapore’s first proper
branch library.

We then turn to the National Archives of Singapore with [Yap Jo Lin](/vol-16/issue-3/oct-dec-2020/building) as our guide. She tells us what the 250,000 plans in the Building Control Division Collection reveal about Singapore’s architecture. The archives are also the focus of [Meira Chand’s](/vol-16/issue-3/oct-dec-2020/diff-sky) essay. By poring over memoirs and listening to oral history interviews, the London-born author was able to recreate in her mind the sights and sounds of mid-20th century Singapore.

As a resident of Marine Parade, [William L. Gibson](/vol-16/issue-3/oct-dec-2020/karikal) became fascinated by two old buildings in his neighbourhood. That led to his essay on Karikal Mahal recounting the colourful history of the two landmarks on Still Road South.

A somewhat larger structure inspired [Erni Salleh](/vol-16/issue-3/oct-dec-2020/borobudur). After completing her Masters degree, the librarian turned her research into *The Java Enigma*, a thriller that delves into the origins of Indonesia’s Borobudur, a Buddhist monument from the 9th century.

Collecting materials that capture present-day events or culture is a way for the National Library to preserve a documentary heritage representative of Singapore. [Janice Loo’s](/vol-16/issue-3/oct-dec-2020/covid19) piece on the  COVID-19 documentation project explains how you can help future generations understand this extraordinary time. [Shereen Tay](/vol-16/issue-3/oct-dec-2020/website), on the other hand, provides an update on a different, but no less important, collection effort: web archiving.

Also, don’t miss [Lee Meiyu’s](/vol-16/issue-3/oct-dec-2020/kim-mui) essay written in Chinese on the Kim Mui Hoey Kuan Collection and [Wan Wee Pin’s](/vol-16/issue-3/oct-dec-2020/book-review) review of the recently published book, *The Year 1000*.

Finally, I would again like to invite everyone to take part in our readers’ [survey](https://efm.jusfeedback.com/Community/se/705E3ED92204BF70). We want to make *BiblioAsia* better than ever, and your feedback is invaluable.
