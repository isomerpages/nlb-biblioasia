**Gek Han**  
Thank you so much for taking the time to do this podcast with us. It’s really thrilling to see a book set in Singapore written by a local writer getting such rave reviews worldwide and locally. How has it been like for you?

**Rachel**
It’s been wonderful. I never db&gt;ared to expect it. When I first started writing the book, maybe five or six years ago, a part of me worried that no one would want to publish, let alone read a book about land reclamation in the 1960s in Singapore. It’s quite a departure from my first book \[_Suicide Club_\], which was speculative fiction with sci-fi concepts. _The Great Reclamation_ is a deep historical fiction with a unique Singaporean setting. But thankfully, it did get published and has received a pretty great response, both in Singapore as well as abroad. And the story seems to be universal in some ways and has spoken to a wide cross section of people across the world.

**Gek Han**  
You’ve really made history come alive. And you’ve made it personal. We’ve read about land reclamation and people resettling. But with these characters, you can really feel the emotions. What gave you the idea to write about this topic?

**Rachel**  
I’ve always been interested in land reclamation. I went to Ngee Ann Primary in Marine Parade, which is built on reclaimed land. And I remember being in probably Primary One, and the teacher saying, “This floor that we’re on right now – this used to be the sea.” This idea that the land didn’t used to be there until quite recently, or that you could make land where there wasn’t land seemed a really exhilarating, but also a frightening thing for a child to hear. And I think that feeling kind of persisted throughout my life in Singapore, because you do see the landscape shift so much when you grow up here, and probably less so in my generation, much more so in the past.

**Gek Han  
**_The Great Reclamation_&nbsp;is your second novel and your first historical fiction work. What do you find challenging or interesting about writing historical fiction?

**Rachel  
**I really loved writing it because I was interested in the topic. And you should probably only write novels on things you’re interested in, because they take a very long time and involve a lot of ups and downs, many downs. And so having the pigheaded persistence to continue, even when you feel like your project is going nowhere, and you will never be able to figure it out. I loved doing the research for this book. I had to force myself to stop researching. I read transcripts of many oral history interviews, a lot of amazing resources on the [_BiblioAsia_ website](https://biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg/)[\[VC(1\]](#_msocom_1)&nbsp; and history books, and I looked at old photographs. But then when it came to writing the book, the challenge was putting aside the facts and the data I had collected – which was quite overwhelming, because there was so much of it – and to try and construct a coherent narrative that felt intimate and personal, and filtered through the characters’ perspectives. Because fiction is about inhabiting someone’s consciousness. And that’s the beauty of fiction. You can live this reality that’s been created through the eyes of the characters. So, including enough but not too much was definitely challenging.

**Gek Han  
**And in your long research process, is there anything that surprised you about Singapore history?

**Rachel  
**I don’t know that it’s anything that surprised me so much as there were many striking details. One detail that made it into the book was the conveyor belt. During the early phases of land reclamation project, a conveyor belt moved the sand dug out to the coasts. Someone asked me if writing historical fiction is a big leap from speculative fiction. Not really because the history is almost science fictional – the way in which the transformation was so audacious and involved technology to that extent – at that time. When you look at the photos, it looks like something out of _Blade Runner_ or something. It’s really fascinating.
