On 10 May 1953, the *Straits Times* ran a story about a film titled *Kampong Sentosa*,[^1] which had premiered in Singapore at the Rex Theatre. In Malay with an all-local cast, the film tells the story of a village in Malaya which was being terrorised by bandits in the surrounding jungle during the Malayan Emergency (1948–60). The story has “love interest and enough suspense to draw Malay-speaking audiences”.[^2]
