In 2016, the National Library Board received a donation of personal papers and documents from the family of Lee Kip Lee and Lee Kip Lin. Lee Kip Lee is a former president of The Peranakan Association, where he still holds the position of honorary life president for his contributions to the association during his 14-year tenure between 1996 and 2010. His younger brother, the late Lee Kip Lin (1925–2011) was equally well known as an architect, university professor and author of several books on Singaporean architecture.

The Lee family papers include documents that the brothers inherited from their father Lee Chim Huk (1889–1958) and uncle Lee Chim Tuan (1880–1955), both of whom were eminent figures in Singapore’s early Peranakan (Straits Chinese) and business communities.

#### **Family Connections**

Lee Kip Lee and Lee Kip Lin hail from a distinguished Peranakan family whose roots in the region date back to more than two centuries ago. Their grandfather Lee Keng Kiat (1851–1917), after whom Keng Kiat Street in Tiong Bahru is named, moved from Malacca to Singapore sometime in the second half of the 19th century and became a partner of a shipping company called Keng Yong Brothers on Telok Ayer Street.

Lee Keng Kiat had six sons and four daughters. His fifth son was Lee Chim Huk (the father of Lee Kip Lee and Lee Kip Lin). Among the siblings, Lee Chim Huk was closest to his brother, Lee Chim Tuan, who was older by nine years. In his childhood memoir *Amber Sands*, Lee Kip Lee recounts that his father and uncle went to the extent of pooling their finances into a common kitty which they called the “Tuan-Huk” account. He remembers that “although the bulk of the income [was] derived from Uncle’s sources, Uncle didn’t mind that Pa, with his wife and five children, were spending more of it than he did”.

Lee Chim Tuan grew up to become a successful entrepreneur. With his younger brother Lee Chim Huk as his partner, they ventured into various businesses in Singapore and Malaya. Lee Chim Tuan was also one of the founding-directors of *The Malaya Tribune* newspaper, which started in Singapore in 1914. But for the most part, he was better known as the “right-hand man” of his father’s first cousin Lee Choon Guan (1868–1924), a prominent businessman1 and the son of Malacca-born Lee Cheng Yan who, in 1858, established Cheng Yan & Co., one of the leading Chinese firms in Singapore at the time and dealing mainly in property and financing.

In 1912, Lee Choon Guan co-founded Chinese Commercial Bank together with the Straits Chinese luminary Lim Boon Keng2 and a few other Chinese merchants, and was appointed its chairman. Lee was also one of the founding directors of Hong Ho Hong Bank in 1917, and sat on the board of several important companies, including the Straits Steamship Company.

Lee Chim Tuan was appointed as general manager of Cheng Yan & Co., and over time became the trusted aide and “confidential manager” to his boss Lee Choon Guan. So close were their ties that in 1921, the younger Lee accompanied his employer, his wife and their family on a long holiday to Europe, America and China. When Lee Choon Guan passed away in 1924, Lee Chim Tuan was named as one of the trustees of the estate in the will.

#### **Overview of the Collection**

The Lee Kip Lee and Lee Kip Lin Family Archives contain approximately 6,000 items, mainly the business and private correspondences of Lee Kip Lee, Lee Kip Lin, Lee Chim Tuan, Lee Chim Huk, Lee Choon Guan and other family members. Besides letters, there are also business documents such as company annual reports, minutes of meetings, business contracts, ledger books and receipts, as well as personal family records such as estate papers, household accounts books, bank statements, remittance slips, invitation cards, postcards and school magazines.

Spanning nearly a century between the 1890s and 1980s, the collection covers critical periods in Singapore’s history, from the colonial era to World War II and the Japanese Occupation, the subsequent return of the British, and the post-independence period.

Assistant Professor Koh Keng We of Nanyang Technological University’s School of Humanities, who has a keen interest in Southeast Asian history and previewed the collection, had this to say: “The collection provides a unique window into the social, cultural, business, and political lives of members of a Chinese Peranakan family over two generations” through which “… we can obtain a detailed picture of their everyday lives, in terms of their business activities, the social and cultural organisations and events that they took part in, their networks, and the social, political, and cultural worlds they lived in”.

#### **Insights into the History of Business**

Indeed, one of the most significant aspects of the collection is the record of business activities and transactions preserved in various letters and documents of the extended Lee family network. These documents serve as primary source materials pertaining to the business and economic history of Singapore – particularly the shipping, banking, mining, rubber and oil industries – from the early 1900s onwards.

Although Singapore did not produce tin or oil, and its rubber yield was negligible, these commodities were the island’s most important exports after the 19th century and once described as “the three pillars” of Singapore’s economic growth. In the first decade of the 1900s, tin was Singapore’s leading export until it was overtaken by rubber in the 1920s. Hence, many of the letters and documents from the early 20th century onwards record the family members’ business activities in rubber and tin as well as their involvement in companies such as Peninsular Tin, Malacca Pinda Rubber Company and Sime Darby & Co.

By the 1920s, oil had overtaken tin to become Singapore’s second most important export. Seizing the opportunity, Lee Chim Tuan and his brother Lee Chim Huk became involved in the oil industry from the very start. Singapore’s oil sector took root in 1891 when Shell (which started out as M. Samuel and Company) began using Pulau Bukom as a storage centre for kerosene. Seeing an opportunity, the two men, along with another brother Lee Chim Teck, established Lee Chim Teck & Co., which provided stevedoring and material handling services to Shell.
