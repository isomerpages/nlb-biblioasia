#### **Introduction**

As a Chinese adage goes, “the sparrow though small, has all five organs”.
Nothing could be truer than this for Tamil writing in Singapore – though
the number of Tamil literary works produced might be small compared
to other countries, Singapore’s Tamil literature is complete in its various
aspects such as heritage, genres and aesthetics. Long before Tamil writing
arrived on today’s postmodern landscape, creative migrant voices were
already heard from Singapore and drew inspiration from well-known writers
from back home in India.

The first collection of poetry from Singapore as well as the region written
in Tamil, *Munajattut Tirattu*, was printed at J. Paton Government Printer
in Singapore in 1872.1 *Singai Vartamani*, the first Tamil newspaper in the
Malay Peninsula, appeared in Singapore in 1875.2 The first anthology of
Tamil short stories, *Navarasa Katha Manjari*, was published in Singapore
in 1930.3 Singapore was the first in the world to launch, on the Internet, an anthology of poems in all four official languages, called Poemnet. In
October 1995, then-president of Singapore Ong Teng Cheong launched the
anthology *Journey: Words, Home and Nation – Anthology of Singapore Poetry
(1984–1995)* on Poemnet.4

Tamil writing in Singapore also portrays changing social realities. “Kudirai
Pandhya Lavani”, a 1893 folk-style poem about horse racing in the country,
describes lively street scenes. After Singapore became independent in 1965,
the Singapore literati grew sensitive to new realities, which was reflected in
their works of that time.

Tamils in Singapore are in the paradoxical position of being the majority
in the Indian community, but yet are a minority of the four races in
the country – this, however, is seldom reflected in their writings. The
journey of Tamil writing in Singapore is akin to travelling on a train in
broad daylight, passing by a variety of landscapes, people and postures.
Similarly, post-independence, literary writing in Tamil has met with starts
and stops. It eventually found its way in the 1970s, settled on its pace in
the 1980s and picked up swift momentum from the 1990s.

For this paper, I have restricted my study to fiction and poetry in Singapore
Tamil literature written between 1965 and 2015. The authors mentioned in
this paper have won coveted literary awards in Singapore and abroad. The
original quotes in Tamil have been listed in Appendix I.
