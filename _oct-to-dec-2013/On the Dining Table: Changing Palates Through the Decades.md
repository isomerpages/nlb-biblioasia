When I was growing up, my grandfather’s elderly cousin would visit us during important festive occasions. The womenfolk in the family would gather to make steamed rice dumplings or 桃粿 (*tao guo*, literally peach dumplings) to use as prayer offerings. I still remember the booming voice of my grandfather’s cousin as her large palms deftly shaped the pink-hued rice dumplings, pressing them into a wooden mould. Nowadays, no one seems to have the time to gather around the kitchen and cook while chatting in the Teochew dialect. These days, my uncles simply buy the *tao guo*; it just tastes different and part of the fun is gone.

#### **My Grandparents'  Generation: 1930s–1950s**
My maternal grandmother arrived in 
Singapore from Guandong province in
China during the late 1930s. As a young
bride, she lived with her husband and
mother-in-law who were farmers. Life
settled into a routine of waking up before
dawn to feed the pigs and chickens,
tending to the vegetable plots, and cooking
three meals a day. My great grandmother
would harvest the vegetables and
sell them at a nearby makeshift market.
