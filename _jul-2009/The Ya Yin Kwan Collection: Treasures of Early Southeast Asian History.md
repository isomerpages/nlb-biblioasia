“*Knowledge is public property and must be shared by all. South East Asia*<br>  i*s situated at the crossroads of the world. In the founding of a new*<br>  s*tate one needs to ponder deeply, and all existing knowledge must be*<br>  *assimilated and collated, before an authentic history can be prepared for*<br>  *posterity to extend the glory of past days*.”<br>             *Tan Yeok Seong*<br>            *Ya Yin Kwan*<br>           *22 July 1964*.
