 #### Lee Kong Chian Research Fellow _Khoo Sim Lyn_ sets out to discover children’s books written in English, which depict World War II in Singapore.
 
#### **Introduction**

To people of my generation, World War II (WWII) in Singapore and Malaya was more than just a historical fact studied in history books because our parents had lived through the war. From their
sporadic recollections, we created our images of what the war must have been like for them: for some, a time of terrible atrocities, and for most, a time of hardship and deprivation. However, as an avid child reader growing up in Malaysia and Singapore, and later as an adult reader of children’s books, it struck me that most of the books I had read depicting WWII were all set in Europe. Thus, the mental images created through my parents were not reinforced in the books I was able to lay my hands on. Imaginatively, at least, it
seemed as if WWII in Europe, with images of children sent to the countryside to escape the bombing, of children coming upon an injured German pilot, of kind families sheltering Jewish refugees, 

was more real to me than WWII in my own region.
Thus, the focus of my research fellowship at the National

Library of Singapore is on children’s books written in English, which

depict WWII in Singapore. As the focus is on imaginative literature,

purely factual materials were excluded, but autobiographies were

included as they resemble fiction in the way the narrative is used.

The Asian Children’s Collection’s definition of children’s books to

mean books “for children up to 14 years of age” (National Library

Board, 2005a, p.33) has also been adopted
