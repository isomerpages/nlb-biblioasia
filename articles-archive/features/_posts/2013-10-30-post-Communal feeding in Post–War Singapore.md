The colonial government’s communal feeding programme was a novel response to chronic food shortages and malnutrition in the aftermath of the Japanese Occupation, and laid the foundation for the basis of social welfare schemes in Singapore.

Political challenges aside, a critical shortage of rice in Southeast Asia also threatened to undermine British au¬thority by worsening malnutrition and a rampant black market.

The communal feeding programme can be attributed to the recommenda¬tions of the Wages and Cost of Living Committee. In May 1946, an inquiry to re¬view the wages of the clerical and working class was commissioned in response to the rising costs of living, particularly the cost of food. After witnessing the desper¬ate conditions of workers, the committee recommended several interim measures, such as temporary cash allowances, cap¬ping of food prices, the setting up of can¬teens by government departments and employers with the means to do so, and opening “in all large urban areas” pub¬lic restaurants “on the lines of British Restaurants in the United Kingdom.”1 The committee also recommended that the canteens and restaurants “should not
