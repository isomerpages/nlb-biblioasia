It has been seven decades since the Hong Kong publisher Union Press (友联出版社) set up an office on the second floor of International Bookstore (国际书店), opposite Clifford Pier, in Singapore in 1952.

Union Press was established in Hong Kong the year before. Its founders had fled the outbreak of the civil war in China between the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party. In 1952, they began publishing *Chinese Student Weekly* (中国学生週报) with editions produced for Singapore/Malaya, Indonesia, Thailand, Myanmar and Vietnam.

To facilitate the distribution of the Singapore/Malayan edition of Chinese Student Weekly, Union Press set up an office in Singapore in 1956 called Union Book (友联书局). And although Union Book was mainly a publisher of books and newspapers, it also had a retail storefront. 

In the 1950s, left-wing influence was strong in Singapore and bookstores that sold publications from mainland China – such as Zhonghua Book Company, The Commercial Press and Shanghai Bookstore Publishing House – were immensely popular. However, Union Book was able to carve a niche for itself because Nanyang University (which had been founded around the same time as Union Book) favoured reading materials from Taiwan. According to retired employee Cai Mingying (蔡明英), who joined Union Book in 1966, the store was always packed on weekends. Most of its customers were Nanyang University students who needed to buy reference books.

Besides selling books, Union Press also produced teaching materials and published magazines. Its most notable publication was the literary magazine Chao Foon (蕉风), which was first published in Singapore in 1955 (the magazine’s headquarters moved to Kuala Lumpur in 1959).

Chao Foon had a profound impact on literature in Singapore and Malaysia, and continues to be influential today. In the last few years, two books that explore its importance to the local literary scene have been published. In 2021, Lim Choon Bee (林春美) wrote Chao Foon and the Non-leftist Mahua Literature (蕉风与非左翼的马华文学),[^1] while Cold War, Localisation and Modernity (冷战、本土化与现代性), which was edited by Tee Kim Tong (张锦忠), Ng Kim Chew (黄锦树) and Lee Soo Chee (李树枝), was published in 2022. A compilation of essays on Chao Foon titled Banana, Coconuts and Hornbill (蕉风·椰雨·犀鸟声), edited by three Japanese researchers, was also published at around the same time.

To commemorate the 70th anniversary of Union Press, A Look Back – Commemorative Book for the 70th Anniversary of Union Book in Singapore (回望—新加坡友联书局70週年纪念特刊) was launched at the Singapore Book Fair on 4 June 2022. Penned by former journalist Zhong Hongzhi (锺宏志), the book traces the history of Union Press and discusses the place of Union Book in the development of Singapore’s society and culture. 

Zhong has always been interested in the history of Chinese bookstores in Singapore. She drafted a dissertation proposal on this topic 10 years ago, but her PhD plans were put on hold when she moved to Hong Kong. When the opportunity came up to commemorate Union Press’s 70th anniversary, Zhong was invited to work on the book. 

She soon realised, however, that there were numerous challenges. Information about the bookstore was sparse and many of its key figures, including former managing director Chow Li Liang (周立良) and former vice-chairman Yu Dekuan (馀德宽), had passed on. But Zhong was able to interview other people, like former general manager Wang Jianwu (王健武), and Xi Huizhang (奚会暲), the former president of Chinese Student Weekly. Unfortunately, some things they brought up could not be verified and had to be left out of the book.
