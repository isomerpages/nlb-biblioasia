#### **Introduction: The Machine Age**
The introduction of mechanised accounting machines in the late 19th century marked a radical break from manual accounting practices. Ranging from punch card readers to cash registers,1 these accounting machines were the ancestors of the modern computer, and constituted a crucial transition stage in Malaya’s technological history.2

From the 1930s to the 1960s, the accounting machine industry in Malaya was dominated by three multinationals, namely the British-based International Computers and Tabulators (ICT) and its American counterparts, National Cash Register (NCR) and International Business Machines (IBM).3 Each of these companies will be examined from three angles: the introduction of their machines, their impact in commerce and
government administration, and their employment and representation
of women. Collectively, a study of these trends helps to reveal Malaya’s
otherwise buried computer proto-history, including a group of unsung
pioneers: women operators.

This paper attempts to construct a subaltern gender narrative from
the dominant masculinist and Eurocentric infrastructure of transnational
corporations, government institutions and commercial media in the first
half of the 20th century. Women may have been the first generation of
operators, but in official documents and media reports, they were often
marginalised. For example, their non-involvement in technological
developments was assumed in a Straits Budget report on a talk on post office
accounts in 1937: “bookkeeping machines and other electronic accounting
devices were demonstrated to the audience, which included non-accountants
and women”.4 In published reports, except for a few European women
supervisors, the women were nameless. In official photographs, women
operators were mostly shown with their backs to the camera or looking
away. Such peripheral representations reflected the perceived status of
these women operators as the “data proletariat” in a male-led industry.
Through assembling these otherwise fragmentary references and images,
the three case studies in this paper make possible a more coherent narrative
of women’s pioneering participation in Malaya’s data mechanisation and
computerisation journey.

#### **“Clever Girls” with the “Queerest Jobs in Town”: The Women Operators of ICT’s Powers-Samas**

The first public mention of modern accounting machines came in the 1920s.
In 1922, replying to open criticisms of the administrative inadequacies of
the Municipality of Singapore by its contracted accountant Major Gooding
Field, the Municipal Commission asserted that “cash registers, Burroughs
Machines, Amco Adders and Merchant Calculators are in daily use in the
Municipal Offices”.5 A decade later, recognising that the bigger and more
sophisticated punch card readers could compile and sort larger volumes of data, the Registrar General announced his intention to purchase the “most
modern accounting machines”.6 Official records from 1935 show the purchase
and installation of a set of mechanised accounting machines for 32,048.07
Straits dollars, together with punch cards (an annually recurring purchase)
for 1,783.04 Straits dollars.7 A few years later, a new system was installed; the
machines were considered a marvel:

     Special cards are punched for each consumer, 
showing consumer names and addresses together with their dealings
with the department. These are automatically sorted and then

     run through a tabulating machine which prints the bills, with

     duplicates which are bound to form a ledger.8

At that point in the late 1930s, 2,000 out of 40,000 of the Municipal
accounts had been mechanised; a full changeover was expected to be
completed within a year.9

This initiative was disrupted by the Second World War, and the system
reportedly suffered from neglect during the Japanese Occupation (1942–45).10
After the war, the machines were in poor condition. Data collected for the
1947 Pan-Malayan Census had to be reconfigured in Ipoh and sent to be
tabulated by the British Tabulating Machine Company in Britain under
the control of the Treasury, with the Malayan authorities bearing the
cost.11 By 1950, the colony had received a consignment of 15 new machines, valued at £12,000, from the United Kingdom.12 These were to be used –
initially alongside their reconditioned older counterparts – to process trade,
financial, salary and demographic statistics.13

The new accounting machines were from the Powers-Samas
organisation, which was part of the Vickers group of companies that was
expanding its operations in Asia through its district office in Calcutta, with
a sales and technical service office in Singapore under Henry Waugh and
Co. Ltd.14 Following the merger with British Tabulating Machine to form
International Computers and Tabulators (ICT) in 1959, the organisation
was further committed to the region. In August 1964, ICT installed the
Federation of Malaysia’s fourth computer – an ICT 1301 system – in the
Public Utilities Board at Singapore’s City Hall, starting the transition out of
the old punch card system to a more automated computerised system.15

From the start, the accounting machines did not just facilitate
bookkeeping and reports, but also provided new employment opportunities,
particularly for women. The participation of this new labour force was
initially not welcomed. In 1932, the <i>Singapore Free Press</i> reported on plans
to install the Powers-Samas machines in three years’ time. The paper’s
comments reflected an underlying anxiety over the accounting machines,
and their women operators:

     It is understood that a proposal has been made to the Crown

     agents to send out about twenty girls with accounting machines

     for the Accounts Department of the F.M.S. [Federated Malay

     States] Railways. The idea, apparently, is to do away with the

     majority of the present staff and train girls for employment.16
