<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>In a musical, the songs carry the emotion. So you must craft all the script
and dialogue to bring it to the point where it is the character's need
to sing. He cannot contain his spoken emotion anymore. He must express
it in a song so that you get all the wonderful songs. In a play, it's not
such a focus on emotional love. You’d have in a musical to interpret love
means not only emotional love but also the desire for self-fulfillment,
self-recognition. There are those differences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Music playing]</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>You're listening to BiblioAsia+, a podcast produced by the National Library
of Singapore. At BiblioAsia, we tell stories about Singapore's past, some
familiar, others forgotten, all fascinating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2024 is the 40th anniversary of the first production of the monodrama
Emily of Emerald Hill, which was written by Stella Kon. The powerful story
of a Peranakan matriarch, reflecting back on her long life, has struck
a chord with audiences here and around the world. According to one estimate,
the play has been performed almost 1,000 times in the last four decades.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My name is Jimmy Yap and I'm the Editor in Chief of <em>BiblioAsia</em>,
a publication of the National Library of Singapore. With me in the studio
is Stella herself. While best known for Emily of Emerald Hill, Stella has
written something like 30 plays, at least 15 scripts for musical theatre,
and a whole bunch of short stories and novels. In fact, her most recent
novel is called <em>4 Pax to Emptiness</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>Thank you for having me, Jimmy. This is very exciting.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Before anything else, can I say a very happy and belated birthday to you.
Eighty is an amazing milestone. How do you feel about reaching your eighth
decade?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>Well, it's a time to take a pause and perhaps reflect and recalibrate.
Perhaps see what new challenges lie ahead.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>You're an inspiration. I know you're probably tired of talking about Emily
of Emerald Hill, so I promise that we won't only talk about that play.
But can I ask though, which was the very first version of the play that
you watched, and how did you feel watching it come to life?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>The first version I watched was oddly not in Singapore, but in Edinburgh.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh!</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>I was living in Edinburgh. My mom rings up and says, you know your play
coming to Edinburgh for the Commonwealth Festival. I said, don't bluff.
It really was. Margaret Chan came to Edinburgh. She visited me and did
the play to an audience of the Commonwealth Festival, which means these
are not just random off the street people, but people selected to, self-selected
to be involved in foreign literature, foreign tropes, and so on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was, for me, really marvellous. I had the opportunity then to see,
as every playwright wants to, to see how you are affecting the audience.
And these are people who are not like our Singapore audience, sensitised
to the Peranakan, that they're going to laugh whenever the matriarch comes
on stage and opens her mouth. They are really following the story. They
are open minded to the dialect that they hear, which at that time, Margaret
wanted to turn down the Peranakan talk. You give it to them just as it
is, which they were, as a foreign audience, they were totally ready to
accept. So you, I watch, I watch, will they laugh in the right places?
Do they look very absorbed? Do they smile when they're just a small little
joke? Do they seem to feel the sorrow and the emotion? And yes, they did.
And that is the most satisfying thing ever for a writer of plays.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>That's amazing. That's such an amazing story. Do you remember when this
was?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>Early, very early, ’85 maybe? Or more like ’84.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>In addition to being staged so many times, like, you know, almost like
1,000 times, right, the play has become a landmark in Singapore's literary
landscape. It has inspired at least one poem, Theodore Lim's <em>Emily of Emerald Hill</em>,
and another play on this Emerald Hill, which is a monologue by Jonathan
Lim.</p>
<p>And we also have a character in <a href="https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/redir/itemdetails?bid=12794467" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Harish Sharma's </a><em><a href="https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/redir/itemdetails?bid=12794467" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Off Centre</a></em> who
thinks that she is Emily Gan. So, now did you have an inkling that Emily
would become so popular? You know, why do you think it's become so beloved?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>Oh, well, I have no idea at the time, but of course some of it is simply
due to the fact that it hit on this whole series of tropes which were just
coming to the consciousness of Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's the Peranakan-ness. And I didn't choose to make her Peranakan, it's
just my grandma is Peranakan. Had she been a Hakka matriarch, it would've
had a rather different play, with a Hakka feel to it. What made it take
off so well is its simple compactness, being made for one actor and a small
backstage crew. Almost low risk for the production team. Because they can
do it anywhere. They can set up upstairs of a bar. Or in the Peranakan
restaurant; anywhere can do.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>And, but it's not just simple, it's so powerful. I'm sure you've watched
many different versions of the play. Which is your favourite? Or, or maybe
if I put it another way, who is your favourite Emily?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>Yeah, I mean, I'm never going to judge which actor is better than others
because each of them has their strengths. Each of them often touches the
audience's hearts in a different way. But the one that is my personal favorite,
for very personal reasons is Neo Swee Lin, because her Peranakan accent
is the closest to the accent that my grandmother had. There are slight
differences between clans and between families. And when Swee Lin opened
her mouth – that's my grandmother's tribe.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>You donated the early drafts of <em>Emily</em> to the National Library a
few decades ago. And because of that, the writer and academic Eriko Ogihara-Schuck
was able to put together a wonderful piece in <em>BiblioAsia</em> about how
the play <a href="https://biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg/vol-20/issue-2/jul-sep-2024/emily-of-emerald-hill-stella-kon/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">evolved from a draft to a final product</a>.
And what was particularly interesting to me is to see how, you know, key
elements change. Namely the, the way in which a key character meets an
untimely demise. In the early draft, that person dies for one reason. In
the final version, that person dies for another reason. So why did you
change the manner of death?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>I think we made it less specific. We made it almost more generic, because
it's not very clear why resulting from being thoroughly taken to task,
but was it enough to push this guy over the edge into seaside? Maybe not.
So then you ask yourself, what's the backstory? What happened? And I don't
want to tell you.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay. Tell us a little about<em> Emily the Musical</em>, I think, which
was staged in 2016. In many ways, it's a, it's a very different work from,
you know,<em> Emily of Emerald Hill</em>. For one, it's a musical. It's
not a monologue. There's more than one character on stage, and you've had
to write new material. And this time you know, you're writing it when you're
a little bit older, right? I think you, when you wrote the original play,
you were probably in your late thirties, maybe?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>Exactly 40. Mainly, what changed was that I'd learned to write musicals.
So the format of a musical, the demands are very, very different. For one
thing, there's more emphasis on feelings, which in a play you do it by
some piece of dialogue, which the audience will have to listen to very
carefully.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And in a musical, you do some music, and she sings big belting song, and
the audience is seized and carried away. That's the main difference. And
also the main theme of the song in the musical is, "Love Was All I Wanted".
In a play, it's not such a focus on emotional love. You'd have in a musical
to interpret love means not only emotional love, but also the desire for
self-fulfilment, self-recognition. So, there are those differences.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>And it's a beautiful song, by the way. I really love it. What's the song
about? Was it hard to write?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>Well, let me tell you, the first thing is, the music comes first. I work
with composer Desmond Moey. I tell him, I'm writing a song, and the hook
line is, love is all I wanted, in which Emily looks back on her life. Please
give me some music. And he writes all the music.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh, I, I thought it was the other way. So he gives you the music and then
you write the words for it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>Because he’s very fussy about his tempos and timing, so I must fit my
dialogue to his notes. I cannot simply play fast and loose with his melody.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>That's amazing.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>I always felt that my job is to give the musician the creative space and
produce his best work. Rather than that, I would impose a certain form
on him. So it's like that. And I think you've heard it. You like the result.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>I love it. I love it. In the mid-1980s, you helped to found a theatre
company that specialises in musicals called Musical Theatre Ltd. Surprise,
surprise. And you've written also at least like 15 scripts for, for musical
theatre. And of course the librettos for them. You know, what draws you
to this genre?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>Yes, when I first was introduced to musicals, I was like going, “Wah,
I'm like someone who's been working in pencils and crayons, suddenly introduced
to oil paints.”&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Is it the music, that the ability of music to move people that appeals
to you?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>Yes, you're, of course, you're quite right. The music carries the whole
emotion. You can see there's so many musicals. It's certainly the most
popular event that can fill up Marina Bay Sands. People go there to be
swept away by the music. And yes, there are all kinds of music. There's
big music and small, small chamber orchestra music and anything can happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>A libretto has a composer and you have to write it to music, but is writing
a libretto very different from writing like a normal play?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>The consideration is you must know where the music is coming in. You must
shape the whole play such that the song fits in nicely. It's no longer
the case that the character, somebody says, “Oh yes, it's a beautiful day.
Oh, what a beautiful morning.” In a musical, the songs carry the emotion.
So you must craft all the script and dialogue to bring it to the point
where it is the character's need to sing. He cannot contain his spoken
emotion anymore. He must express it in a song so that you get all the wonderful
songs. My all-time favourite is <em>Les Mis</em>, <em>Les Miserables</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>I love <em>Les Mis</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>Yes, and each one you look at the emotions. Boy, that's why the stand-alone
songs also are such favorites everybody want to see.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>So your favorite musical is actually Les Mis?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>Yes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>What about the musicals that you've written, you know, which are you proudest
of? Would it be Emily or would it be maybe...&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>Well, proudest is always the most recent, you know. The youngest baby
is the favourite always.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Which was?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br><em>Lim Boon Keng</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br><em>Lim Boon Keng</em>. That was about one of your great-grandfather?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>Yes, my great-grandfather. The writing of Lim Boon Keng has been ongoing
for more than 20 years.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>20 years!&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>Before I really know how to write musicals. I’d just write a play and
fling in some songs that isn't a musical. It was very difficult to shape
the man's life, which has so many twists and turns and ups and downs.</p>
<p>But from early on, I knew it starts about this man was condemned by the
Singapore population for his role in so-called collaboration with the Japanese
in World War II and spent his final years under a cloud. So he died, as
it were, rejected by his Peranakan society. And that was what I really
wanted to write about, was in a way, to rehabilitate him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Around somewhere in the mid- 90s, Lee Kuan Yew spoke about Lim Boon Keng
as the great bilingual communicator, a proponent of speaking Mandarin,
and also a great civil servant in Singapore. And Lee Kuan Yew did rehabilitate
him from the accusation that he had collaborated with the Japanese. So
that was fine, and after that, my need was not so burning<em> lah</em>.
So I think he has been rehabilitated. But anyway, it took a long time for
another 15 years to bring up the musical.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>You've just had a new book published, and by Penguin no less. At the ripe
young age of 79. Tell me about <em><a href="https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/redir/itemdetails?bid=206064640" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">4 Pax to Emptiness</a></em>.
What's it about?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>To begin with, I wrote it in 1997. I was much younger then. To tell the
truth, I've been carrying it around and offering it to various Singapore
publishers. They said, “Very interesting, but it's such a niche interest.”
They are not sure whether they can make the sales that will make it viable.
They tried to even look for ways and means to do, but in the end, Penguin
being a big guy who can have the margins to take a chance on something
like this.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>So without giving too much of the book away, you know, and of course we
want everyone to buy the book, or borrow it from the library, what's the
book about?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>It's about four Singaporeans who discovered that there was a terrible,
bad famine in China, some 30 years before the book opens, but the echoes
of pain, the psychic reverberations, the spirits, in fact, of the hungry
ghosts in China are, to some way, affecting people in Singapore who know
nothing about that situation. They finally decide what they have to do
is to go to China and make offerings at like funeral offerings at one of
the sites which is a focal point of the famine and they get to do this.
And which is what the book is really about.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>All right, you know, you've written plays, you've written scripts for
musical theatre, you've written short stories, you've written poems, and
of course, novels. What are some of the common themes in your work?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>Consciously, one of the earliest themes was Singapore nationalism. Because
as a person coming of age around the early ’60s, it was almost like, well,
your national service duty to write about Singapore’s national subjects.
So, <em>The</em>  <em>Trial</em> is about that. <em>Emily</em>, as well, with
its Peranakan roots. It's about that. And in other ways, it's permeated
everything I've written. I think you could say the people in <em>4 Pax to Emptiness</em> have
very Singaporean profiles.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>They do! I was reading it and recognising a lot of the characters.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>I hope you laughed once or twice. One of the other themes is the quest
for personal redemption.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Ah.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>And that is why you'd find in <em>Emily of Emerald Hill</em>, Eriko pointed
out that Emily, has a moment in which she shows unexpected kindness to
her old friend. She shows a softer side of Emily you never knew she had.
That's her moment of redemption. Most of the characters have that moment
of redemption, except the main character in <em>Trial</em> who sort of turns
his back on it. He has his chance to, or he's offered it and he turns away
from it. So, that is some of it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>That is a possibility of redemption.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>There's always a possibility, yes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Right. Okay, that's very interesting. You're, you're an amazingly productive
writer, I mean.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>Forty years can build up quite a stack of work. What the layperson doesn't
realise is that is the tip of the iceberg. The pile of rewrites, rejects
and sheer projects that collapse is much higher than the pile of what you
see here.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>I can absolutely believe that, but that only underlines the fact, you
know, that you are incredibly productive as a writer. Tell us about your
writing process. Do you have certain, practices or rituals? Do you force
yourself to write 1,000 words a day?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br><em>Aiyo, aiyo</em>! I usually did try to, save the earliest hours of
the day after breakfast immediately to do any writing before you get sidetracked
into the rest of the day's business. I know today I'm going to have this
long, difficult scene to write, and I usually do drafts in pencil, not
on a computer. What I do is I take a long, long bus ride on my senior citizen
pass, go on the bus to the far end of one of the bus rides, and come back.
Do you know the number 36? It's a very nice one. It goes up the sea all
the way to the airport. Turn around, you can even get down and have coffee
at the airport, and then come back again. And it's like the world is passing
by every time you need a bit of break from the work, you look up, you see
nice scenery passing by. Nobody bothers you. You sit in your seat in air-conditioned
comfort. It's very fun.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>And you use that as a break from work? Or when you need to think?</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>It's actually a writing break. Sometimes I go for a walk while I'm thinking.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Do you ever get like writer's block?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>I'm sure I did. When I was writing <em><a href="https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/redir/itemdetails?bid=6322090" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Dragon's Teeth Gate</a></em>,
it was so blocked. I would walk around in sheer frustration until I actually
had a sort of breakdown and had to go to bed for three, for three weeks
till I recovered. Meanwhile, the children had to fend for themselves, give
them money, go and buy fish and chips.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>I'm sure they didn't complain about that.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>I managed to keep them, surviving till then. But the most annoying thing
was after that, they pushed me for deadline. When I delivered it a little
bit behind deadline, nothing happened. No producer wants to take it on
for ages and ages. Annoying. And then, well, you know, after that, in the
end, that script never did get produced. But that'sanother story.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>That is another story. Who has influenced you in your writing?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>First and foremost, from the very beginning is the great, the one and
only J. R. R. Tolkien.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh, okay, you're a Tolkien fan.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>14 years old when I first read it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Which one? The Hobbit or...?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>No, no. Hobbit was 12 years old. I barely counted. <em>Lord of the Rings</em> beginning
to end.
<br>When I finished out that night, I cannot sleep. Got up, sat at typewriter
and bashed out a very derivative pseudo kind of, dragons and guys in armour
kind of story, but that was it. With poetry in it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh, so Tolkien. Anyone else?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>Stephen King, because his writing skill is amazing. He is, you see all
the tricks and types of a good writer are in Stephen King. And others <em>la</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay, okay.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>Actually, all pulp fiction. The ones I read, favourite writers I read
for fun, are John MacDonald, Lois Bujold, Jonathan Kellerman. And the common
element of all of them is extreme readability. You can pick up any of their
books and just dive in, and you will need not emerge for a long time.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>I love those types of books.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>It sucks you in. I believe that's what I've been aiming at in my writing
too.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>So, you know, what's next for Stella Kon? I mean, you're 80 years young.
What else is there to conquer? What are your plans?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>Well, actually, I'm applying to do a MA degree at LASALLE University.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh, fantastic.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>In creative writing. I did an MA at NTU 10 years ago, in creative writing.
Since then, I sort of continued my musicals writing but I feel now I don't
have the energy I had last time. And I would really benefit from stimulation
with young people, workshop teaching, etc, etc. So I hope, I hope this
works out for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>It sounds, it sounds very exciting. Okay, we've come to this part of the,
of the podcast where we, we sort of, you know, turn away from all these
heavy topics and move on to lighter topics. What advice do you have for
writers. Or what's the best writing advice you've ever been given?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>Okay, one was from Rudyard Kipling, who says, always keep on editing and
cutting and shortening your work. Take a big marker pen and cut everything
you can cut. Put it aside, come back one month's time and cut some more.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>But it's very painful, right?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>It's nice, you know. You sort of see the bones of your work showing through.
So, it ends up with my writing, especially in the book called <em><a href="https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/redir/itemdetails?bid=12768090" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Eston</a></em>,
coming out as somewhat gnomic, you know? People sometimes don't quite get
it. But it's fun to puzzle the people a bit.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>What advice would you give apart from Kipling's advice?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>The second thing is, when you start off to write your thing, don't start
at the beginning necessarily. Start with whatever is the part you see most
vividly in your mind, the scene that's the most alive to you. Get that
down on paper. Then maybe there's another one that you can string them
together much later.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh, that's an interesting idea. I didn't even thought of that.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>Before the days of computer, I'd have this all on strips of paper and
punch hole and put in a ring binder and swap the pieces around and clip
and staple and paste the bits into order.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Wow. Okay. Complete the sentence. Okay. Writing is...&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>Most fun.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Is it? Some people will say that, you know, it's so painful.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>Well, on the one hand, if you're doing the part that really comes to your
mind, it is cathartic. You're getting it off your chest, and you have a
chance to make it as best as you can. It's fun.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>So, you know, Stella, you've, you've reached a stage where you no longer
have anything else left to prove. What are you most proud of in your life?
Whether it's your writing or parts of your life.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>I suppose just that I managed to keep the flag flying more or less through
thick and thin.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Is that Stella Kon talking or is that Emily Gan talking?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>It's certainly not Emily. You know, they say of Shakespeare, you never
know which of his characters is really speaking for him. And that's how
it is for a playwright. You speak through the mask of characters. On my
desk, I had a series of little masks of no characters, the things you bring
back as souvenirs.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh yes, yes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>Yes, because that's what the writer of plays does. They fit on all the
different masks and speak for them.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Wonderful, wonderful. Stella, thank you very much for coming on BiblioAsia+
It was a real pleasure having you. Read Stella's latest book, <em>4 Pax to Emptiness</em>.
It's available at bookshops everywhere, and of course at libraries all
over Singapore. And I also want to urge everyone to read Eriko's amazing
article on how <em>Emily of Emerald Hill</em> started out as <a href="https://biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg/vol-20/issue-2/jul-sep-2024/emily-of-emerald-hill-stella-kon/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Betty of Balmoral Road</a>.
Thank you again, Stella for coming.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stella</strong>
<br>Thank you. It's really been a pleasure, Jimmy.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>It is a pleasure and a privilege to have you. I would like to leave all
our listeners with the very moving song from<em> Emily the Musical.</em> And
the song is "Love was All I Wanted".and was published by Penguin Southeast
Asia in 2023. Welcome to BiblioAsia+, Stella. Thank you for coming on this
podcast.</p>
