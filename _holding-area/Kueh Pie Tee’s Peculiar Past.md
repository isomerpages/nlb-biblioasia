#### **Episode summary** ####
Join award-winning cookbook author Christopher Tan as he investigates the mysterious origins of _kueh pie tee_ and its connection to American cuisine, while making the snack from a recipe in Susie Hing’s 1956 cookbook, _In a Malayan Kitchen_.

Using both local moulds and American “patty irons” dating back to the 1950s–70s, Christopher shows us the different shell shapes that can be made, and how the fillings have changed over time – from cream or milk-based sauces in the Western version to those inspired by the local _popiah_.
