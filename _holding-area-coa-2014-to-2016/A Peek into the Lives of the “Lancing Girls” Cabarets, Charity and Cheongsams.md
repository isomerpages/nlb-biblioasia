#### **Introduction**
Who were the so-called “lancing” girls1 of yesteryear? They were the
glamorous dance hostesses from the cabarets of the “big three” worlds of
entertainment in Singapore’s past – New World, Great World and Happy
World – who made a living from “lancing”, a Singlish mispronunciation
of “dancing”. This paper examines the way of life of these women in the
cabaret industry, with a focus on two of them who founded The Happy
School, a Chinese school that provided free education for street kids after
World War II . In a bid to regain their pride after having been being looked
down on for working in the cabaret, the “lancing girls” are shown here to
have contributed generously to charity. Speaking to four research subjects
in their 70s and 80s who had once been associated with the cabaret, we
trace the beginnings of Singapore’s nightclub dance scene, observe the rise
of pop music and the evolution of the *cheongsam* as a “lancing” dress. The
unadulterated accounts of the lives of these people offer a candid look at
Singapore’s unique history through the glitz (and sleaze) of the New, Great
and Happy Worlds.

#### **Background of the Cabaret World**
The New World Amusement Park was the first to open in 1923 at Jalan
Besar. Great World Amusement Park at Kim Seng Road opened next in
1931. Happy World, located between Mountbatten and Geylang roads, was
the last of the three to open, in 1936. Its name was changed to Gay World in
1964 when cinema operator Eng Wah took over the ownership.2

These parks were similar in their entertainment offerings, which included
shopping, film-going and dining. But what really drew the crowds were
the dance halls or cabarets. New World was famous for Bunga Tanjong,
a cabaret that hosted bands playing Malay tunes and* ronggeng* (a couple
dance likely to have originated from Java, also known as *joget*). Great World
attracted British servicemen and the middle class, with free films, Peking
operas as well as wrestling and boxing matches. Happy World was known
for its Sarong Kebaya Nights at the Happy Cabaret.3

During the war, all three worlds were converted into gambling farms. After
the end of the Japanese Occupation, western music could once again be
heard in Singapore. The cabarets resumed happy times, drawing young girls
into their dance halls to work and help their families put food on the table.
Single men, married men, couples and groups of people seeking after-dinner
entertainment all came trooping back. Bands comprised quartets, trios or a
hotchpotch of music lovers forming dance bands.

The repertoire of music ranged from Broadway to those by famous
composers such as Cole Porter and George Gershwin, to the music of the
swing era; anything that would draw in the masses – even local music
played by* keroncong* (an Indonesian musical style) bands – filled the air of
dance halls. Some of the more popular big bands included those led by
Cecil Wilson, Gerry Soliano, H.H. Tan and Peggy Tan, Sid Gomez and
Alfredo (Fred) Libio, who had his “all-star” Filipino Swing Band.4
