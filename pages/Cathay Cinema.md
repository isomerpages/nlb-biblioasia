#### The First Skyscraper in Singapore
The 16-storey Cathay Building was once the tallest building in Singapore, at 70 m. Located at the foot of Mount Sophia in the Dhoby Ghaut area, the building used to house the Cathay Hotel, Cathay Restaurant and Cathay cinema, which was one of Singapore’s oldest cinemas.[^1]

#### A Lavish Interior
The theatre was opulent, with black marble pillars, green-tiled floors, silver curtains, and gold ceilings. On either side of the screen was the shell-shaped acoustic plaster design.[^3] 



#### Opening Film
Cathay was the first cinema with air-conditioning in Singapore. Its opening film was Four Feathers, a British adventure movie about the war in Sudan that was previously banned in Singapore on racial grounds.[^4] 
 
 
#### World War II
In 1941, Cathay Building was rented to the colonial government and the Malayan Broadcasting Corporation.

After Singapore fell to the Japanese in 1942, the building became home to the Japanese broadcasting and propaganda Departments. The broadcasting department began transmissions of Radio Syonan from Cathay building in March 1942. The programme was printed in the newspaper Syonan Shimbun.[^5]

The daytime programme of Radio Syonan usually has Japanese lessons and songs for schools, while the evening programme included a segment for Japanese soldiers, as well as news and entertainment in Japanese, Hindustani, Malay, Tamil, Cantonese, Hokkien and English.[^6]

#### Headquarters for SACSEA
After the war, the Cathay Building became the headquarters for Admiral Louis Mountbatten, Supreme Allied Commander of Southeast Asia (SACSEA), from November 1945 to November 1946. The colonial government occupied six floors of the building. To commemorate the setting up of the SACSEA headquarters, Mountbatten presented a brass plaque to Mrs Loke Yew and Mr Loke Wan Tho, owners of Cathay Building.[^7]

#### Civilian Use of the Building
The cinema reopened in September 1945, but it was only in February 1949 that the colonial government vacated the building and Cathay Organisation regained full control. On 9 January 1954, Cathay Hotel started operations until 30 December 1970. After that, the space was converted into offices. [^8]  

#### Redevelopment
From the 1960s to 1990s, the building underwent various redevelopments, such as the expansion of the cinema from a single-screen to a multiplex in 1992.[^9]

#### Redevelopment

In 1999, Cathay Organisation put up a S$100-million plan to redevelop Cathay Building. Before the plan was approved by the Urban Redevelopment Authority, the Preservation of Monuments Board (now known as the Preservation of Sites and Monuments) identified Cathay Building as a possible landmark for preservation because of its history, especially during WWII.[^10] The cinemas in Cathay Building closed on 30 June 2000. 

By then, the National Heritage Board had erected a WWII plaque outside the building.[^11] 

#### National Monument
On 10 February 2003, Cathay Building was gazetted as a national monument. The art deco facade of the building was preserved, with its geometric forms and curved, stepped walls, and with the name displayed vertically. 

The rest of the building was redeveloped, and the original brown-tiled façade was incorporated into modern glass architecture.[^12].

 In 2006, The Cathay reopened with as a shopping mall and an eight-hall multiplex –  including Picturehouse, which had first opened in 1990 to feature art films.[^13]

The Cathay Cinema ceased operations on 27 June 2022. The last movie to be screened was *Top Gun: Maverick*.[^14]
