#### **INTRODUCTION**
As is well known, Japan started their invasion of Southeast Asia on
8 December 1941, when the Japanese Imperial Army landed at Kota Bharu
in British Malaya. However, amongst historians, debate continues regarding
when the Japanese state officially adopted a policy of southward military
expansion into Southeast Asia. Broadly speaking, their conclusions differ
depending on how they define “the South” in reference to Asia.

For one, researchers who understand the term as referring to southern
China have argued that the Japanese state adopted a doctrine of southern
expansion (南進論; *Nanshinron*) in the latter half of the 1890s. For evidence,
Ito Mikihiko has pointed to the Xiamen Incident in 1900, when a Japanese
temple, Higashi Hongan-ji, in Xiamen, China, was destroyed in an arson
attack. After the cession of Taiwan in 1895, Japan had begun eyeing the
province of Fujian, where Xiamen is located. Recognising the arson attack
as an opportunity to expand into southern China, it dispatched a small
naval brigade to the Chinese city. However, Britain responded by sending a
warship and naval brigade, and Japan agreed to immediately withdraw.1

On the other hand, historians who define “the South” in Asia as
encompassing Southeast Asia and the South Pacific islands hold a different
view. Hatano Sumio, for instance, argues that southern expansion as a
Japanese state policy began in 1914, when Japan first occupied a German
colony in the South Pacific as part of a military campaign during the
First World War. Nevertheless, he acknowledges that full-scale southern
expansion did not commence until the 1930s.2

However, scholars who understand “the South” in Asia as Southeast Asia
have mostly argued that Japan did not officially adopt its policy of southern
expansion until 1936. Yano Toru points out that two doctrines formulated
on 7 August 1936 were important for the cause of Japanese expansionism in
Southeast Asia: the Fundamentals of National Policy (*Kokusaku No Kijun*)
and the Imperial Foreign Policy Doctrine (*Teikoku Gaiko Hoshin*). The
former, in describing Japan’s southward expansion, states that “Japan expects
its national and economic advance into the South, especially into Southeast
Asia, through gradual and peaceful means”. Similarly, the latter underscores
the importance of the South for Japan: “The South Seas…is a strategic area
for world trade and the vital region for the Empire’s industry and defence.”3
Both policies are generally understood to be the earliest official Japanese
documents to stipulate a policy of expansion into Southeast Asia.4

On the whole, most historians agree that Japan’s expansionist policy towards
Southeast Asia began no earlier than in the 1930s. They also largely maintain
that the Japanese navy played a major role in planning the region’s invasion,
for two important reasons. First, the navy’s fleets and aircraft needed oil for
fuel. As the US–Japan relationship deteriorated, the navy began to consider
using military measures to advance into Southeast Asia to secure oil and
other natural resources.5 The second factor was the long-standing rivalry between the Japanese navy and army for limited military funding. Once the army had established the puppet state of Manchukuo in China in 1932, it began demanding more of Japan’s military budget in order to defend the puppet state. At that time, the Japanese navy first proposed its plan to invade Southeast Asia in a bid to keep its budget intact.6

By the end of 1936, as the Washington and London naval treaties approached their expiration, an arms race was expected to begin between Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. To address the impending situation, the Japanese government formulated the Fundamentals of National Policy and the Imperial Foreign Policy Doctrine. It began planning to seize oil fields on Borneo and Sumatra, among other sites, in case oil imports to Japan were blocked.7 In that sense, Japan’s plan to invade Southeast Asia does indeed seem to have first surfaced in the 1930s.

However, several years ago, primary sources that appear to erode this argument were found by Singaporean collector Lim Shao Bin in a shop for used books in Tokyo, Japan. The letters and contracts suggest that long before the 1930s, some staff members of the Japanese army had already devised a plan to invade and colonise Southeast Asia step-by-step. Among those materials, a letter written by Major General Utsunomiya Taro (宇都宮太郎), then chief of the Second Division, Department of the Japanese Army General Staff, titled “On the Preparation for the Nanpo Operation” (南方経略の準備事業に就き) and dated 1 August 1910, is of particular importance. The letter contains Utsunomiya’s master plan to colonise Southeast Asia and even includes concrete directions addressed to Reserve Colonel Koyama Shusaku (小山秋作), Utsunomiya’s former colleague and personal agent, for a secret operation of the Japanese army. According to these documents, Utsunomiya had dispatched Koyama to Singapore to conclude land lease contracts with landowners on the nearby Riau Islands to build military outposts. Nevertheless, the question remains as to how such newly found materials should be interpreted.

Through studying this set of materials, this paper seeks to resolve two dilemmas. First, it examines how and why Utsunomiya’s Nanpo operation was conducted. Because no literature has ever discussed Japan’s plans for invasion made in the 1910s, including the Nanpo operation, revealing the developments of the operation can illuminate that area of study. Second, the paper examines the impact of the Nanpo operation on the conventional assumptions among historians: that Japan’s expansionist policy towards Southeast Asia began in the 1930s at the earliest, and that the Japanese navy played a vital role in establishing that policy. This paper seeks to analyse whether these beliefs should be reconsidered in light of the discovery of the Nanpo operation not as a Japanese naval operation but as Army General Utsunomiya’s secret land-leasing operation, which occurred long before the 1930s. It also traces the origins of the Nanpo operation and presents its developments in chronological order.

#### **Initial Success of the Nanpo Operation**
Utsunomiya initiated the covert Nanpo operation following information shared by Tashiro Kyohachi (田代強八) on 26 April 1910 in Tokyo about the possibility of leasing land on the Riau Islands. At the time, Tashiro was serving as financial adviser to Dao Anren (刀安仁) in Ganya (present-day Yingjiang) in Yunnan province, China. When Tashiro visited Utsunomiya in Tokyo, he told Utsunomiya that he had provisionally agreed to lease land on some islands close to Singapore in the Dutch East Indies and hoped that Utsunomiya would complete the land-leasing operation. Responding affirmatively, Utsunomiya said, “This land lease might become an initial step to serve a bigger purpose.”8

On 12 May, Utsunomiya handed over a set of documents concerning the plan to lease land in the Riau Islands to Army Minister Terauchi Masatake (寺内正毅) and asked him to issue his judgement of the plan at their next meeting. Terauchi responded that he would relay the documents to Minister of Communications Goto Shinpei (後藤新平), and encouraged Utsunomiya to meet Goto. Two days later, Utsunomiya visited Goto and shared his plan. Meanwhile, Terauchi’s secretary, Yoshida, also visited Goto to show him Utsunomiya’s lease documents. In response to Utsunomiya, Yoshida conveyed Terauchi’s opinion that it would be better to remain uninvolved in leasing land on the islands for the time being.

Despite receiving a negative reply from the army minister, Utsunomiya
persisted in his vision, believing the operation warranted further research.9
He wrote a letter dated 25 May 1910, to Lieutenant Matsumoto Gozaemon
(松本五左衛門), a military attaché to the Japanese consulate in Singapore,
ordering him to conduct research about leasing land on the Riau
Islands.10In response, on 23 June, Matsumoto issued a report stating that
Japan had some opportunities to lease land there, though the terrain was
not ideal.11

Around the same time, Utsunomiya began recruiting another agent for the
planned operation – a former colleague, Reserve Colonel Koyama Shusaku.
On 18 June, when Koyama was visiting Utsunomiya at home, Utsunomiya
expressed the necessity of colonising Southeast Asia.12 Two days later,
Koyama visited Utsunomiya’s office and went over several documents on
Southeast Asia. Perhaps as a result of such efforts, Koyama responded with
great interest when Utsunomiya asked for his help to execute the landleasing
operation.13

Shortly after, Utsunomiya wrote a letter to Koyama titled “On the
Preparation for the Nanpo Operation” dated 1 August 1910. As previously
mentioned, this letter contained Utsunomiya’s master plan to colonise
Southeast Asia as well as concrete directions addressed to Koyama. It
identifies the Dutch East Indies as the chief target for future Japanese
territory, where, the letter claims, the Kapuas and Sambas river valleys in
West Kalimantan were considered to be best for leasing land due to their
proximity to British Borneo (present-day Sarawak, Sabah and Brunei).
Banking on the Anglo-Japanese Alliance (1902–23), Japan hoped that the
British would support their expansion into West Kalimantan. Moreover,
the lands were thought to be strategically located, along maritime routes
between Japan and Europe. To secure these areas, the letter continues,  military outposts near Singapore would be pivotal. As a first step, Utsunomiya suggested two desirable areas in which to lease land: some islands located to the west of Pulau Bintan, and some islands to the south of it.14 Given these contents, the letter reveals that some Japanese army staff had already envisioned expanding Japan’s colonies into Southeast Asia as early as the second decade of the 20th century.

To realise the master plan, Tashiro and Koyama were dispatched to Singapore on 6 August, on the same boat departing Kobe, Japan. They had visited their boss separately four days earlier and at different locations, to bid him goodbye. This suggests that the two agents did not have a close relationship.15 Later, Tashiro ran into conflict with Koyama Matsumoto. Tashiro was unable to conclude any land lease agreements,
whereas Koyama succeeded in signing two contracts.16 

Although Utsunomiya provided Tashiro with approximately 700 yen
(equivalent to roughly 2,177,000 yen in 2015)17 and Koyama with 2,000
yen (equivalent to 6,220,000 yen in 2015) before their departure, it was a
continual struggle to raise funds for the operation. To raise the 700 yen
for Tashiro, Utsunomiya had had to ask Lieutenant General Fukushima
Yasumasa (福島安正) to divert funds from Shinbu Gakko (振武学校), a
special school for Chinese students.18 When Matsumoto and Koyama sent
a telegraph, dated 25 October 1910, requesting an additional 5,000 yen
(equivalent to 15,550,000 yen), Utsunomiya again turned to Fukushima
for funding, but was only able to obtain 2,000 yen. He borrowed the
remaining 3,000 yen from a company called Meiji Shogyo (明治商業) by
furnishing his private estate as security. On 26 October, Utsunomiya
visited Minister of Communications Goto to ask whether he could
provide him with 3,000 yen. Although Goto did not reply immediately,
he ultimately prepared the requested sum from a bank called Dai Jugo
Ginko (第十五銀行).19 Utsunomiya faced an uphill task raising funds for
the Nanpo operation because it had not secured the approval of Army
Minister Terauchi.

In time, Koyama’s efforts brought about two contracts, both signed
on 1 November 1910. One was between Uyeda Ushimatsu (上田丑松),
a permanent Japanese resident in the Dutch East Indies who was also
Koyama’s deputy, and Ki Hiong Tje (紀芝發), a Chinese landowner of Pulau
Ayer Raja (Airraja in the present-day spelling);20 and the other between
Uyeda and Abdul Rahman Shah, the sultan of the Riau-Lingga Sultanate, who owned the islands (or *pulau*) of Kila, Momoi and Awi near Pulau
Ayer Raja.21

Pulau Ayer Raja, the largest island of the four leased to Uyeda, is situated
south of Batam Island. According to the mentioned contract, the island was
to be leased for 2,500 Straits dollars, but after owner Ki had received 500
dollars as a down payment,22 he departed for China, never to return to the
Riau Islands. As a result, the transfer of Pulau Ayer Raja’s surface rights to
Uyeda was not completed.23

As for the three small islands of Kila, Momoi and Awi, the transfer of
surface rights was successfully executed after Uyeda paid the sultan 250 dollars.24 On 4 November, Koyama concluded another contract with Uyeda,
stipulating that Uyeda would transfer his surface rights on the four islands
to Koyama unconditionally once Koyama obtained the permanent residency
status in the Dutch East Indies. As a result, Koyama reserved the right to
issue decisions regarding the leasing of land and to use all proceeds from the
land, and Uyeda promised not to intervene. Koyama was to pay Uyeda 2,750
dollars as a fee to purchase the surface rights to the four islands at Uyeda’s
request, and Koyama, in return, would pay Uyeda 1,000 dollars as a reward
once he obtained permits to lease land on the four islands.25

In that way, Koyama managed to acquire the right to use pieces of land
on Kila, Momoi and Awi, all situated near Singapore. But why did Sultan
Abdul Rahman, the owner of the three islands, virtually cede his land to
a Japanese individual? The next section examines the political difficulties
faced by the sultan at the beginning of the 20th century.
