#### Librarian _Kartini Saparudin_ highlights resources held by the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library as well as the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (ISEAS) library and the Central Library of the National University of Singapore (NUS) on the Hadhrami Arabs in Southeast Asia.

#### **Introduction**

Although there has been increasing interest in the Hadhrami communities of Southeast Asia, there has yet to be a single bibliography dedicated to this subject. Therefore, two years ago, a team comprising of librarians and library officers from the National Library, Singapore embarked on a project to compile a bibliography on the Hadhrami Arabs in Southeast Asia. Initially, we thought that literature on the subject would be limited but we were in for a surprise when we found a vast though scattered literature on the subject. It was then that we saw the value this bibliography could bring to researchers and scholars in the field.

The bibliography was published in conjunction with the National Library Singapore’s* Rihlah – Arabs in Southeast Asia Exhibition*. Entitled *The Hadhrami Arabs in Southeast Asia with special reference to Singapore*, it documents resources held by the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library as well as the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (ISEAS) library and the Central Library of the National University of Singapore (NUS).This bibliography is useful as a guide for research but is not exhaustive. Apart from showcasing the resources in these libraries, this aims to be a resource for academics and librarians to further redefine new areas for research and collection development.

This is not the first listing on the Hadhrami Arabs in Indonesia. There was Hisyam Ahmad’s *Bibliografi studi masyarakat Arab di Indonesia* (1981).2 It comprised a six-page listing with key highlights by specialists on Indonesia such as Snouck Hurgronje, J.M van der Kroef and Anthony Reid. As his bibliography was written in 1981 and limited to Indonesia in scope, a more comprehensive and updated bibliography seemed timely as scholarship on Indonesia has since expanded greatly.

Apart from Hisyam’s list, there are existing bibliographical listings that capture the scope of publishing efforts in the Malay world. Although these bibliographies were not focused on the subject of Hadhramis *per se*, these listings reflect the publishing efforts by Hadhramis in the region, because of the dominance of Hadhramis in the publishing industry in the Malay world. The Hadhramis were involved in publishing both Arab language materials for their communities, and Malay publications for the wider Malay market. This is demonstrated in William Roff’s *Bibliography of Malay and Arabic periodicals published in the Straits Settlements and Peninsular Malay States 1876–1941: With an annotated union list of holdings in Malaysia, Singapore and the United Kingdom* (1972); and in Patricia Lim’s *Singapore, Malaysian and Brunei newspapers: An international union list* (1992). Roff lists 15 Arabic periodicals from Singapore and Lim lists 13 such titles, also in Singapore.3

In Indonesia, there is Natalie Mobini-Kesheh’s listing of 36 periodical titles. Her article *The Arab periodicals of the Netherlands East Indies, 1914–1942* includes data of known holdings, in a form consistent with Roff’s bibliography.4 The bulk of these holdings are found in the Perpustakaan Nasional Republik Indonesia (National Library of Indonesia). There are 14 titles which are now also accessible on microfilm at the library of the Royal Institute for Linguistics and Anthropology (KITLV) in Leiden. Additional holdings at the library of the Leiden State University (LU), and some private collections in Indonesia, are also included, although Mobini-Kesheh is quick to add that the listing is far from exhaustive.

Over the decade, a few researchers are beginning to provide details on the publishing output of the Hadhrami communities in Southeast Asia, going beyond territories defined by different colonial experiences. Kazuhiro Arai’s “Arab” periodicals in the first half of the 20th century in Southeast Asia in the *Journal of Sophia Asian Studies*5 combines both Roff’s and MobiniKesheh’s bibliographic listings. He presents a more holistic way of looking at the publishing industry, while reducing the discrepancies found in Roff’s and Mobini-Kesheh’s data. Arai’s list also includes Jawi literature in Southeast Asia, as do Roff’s and Mobini-Kesheh’s.6 However, the writer admits that his list requires further checking for researchers’ accessibility.

Like Arai, David Hirsch creates a list of Hadhrami-published periodicals in his article Hadrami-Arabic press in *Southeast Asia: A historical survey*. From visits to contacts and libraries in Southeast Asia, and even the United Kingdom, he lists and acquires Southeast Asian and Arabic vernacular publications of the Hadhrami communities in Singapore, Penang, Johor, Surabaya, Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur. This list also reflects 28 Hadhrami titles that are currently housed in the University of California (UCLA)’s library.7

In addition to bibliographical listings of Hadhrami periodicals, other basic forms of bibliography exist as reference lists of scholarly literature. Some of them are from theses such as Mohammad Redzuan Othman’s *The Middle East influence on the development of religious and political thought in Malay society, 1880–1940* (1994). Theses or reference lists from secondary literature serve as a starting point for this bibliography. Rather than merely building upon existing bibliographies or reference lists, this bibliography includes unexplored articles found in dailies, serials and ephemera published in the 19th and 20th centuries that are in our collection.

We would like to address this growing need for an organised bibliography in the midst of growing scholarship on the subject. In addition, this compilation is possibly the first fully annotated bibliography to bring together different subjects on the Hadhrami community in Southeast Asia.

As evidenced by a compendium of secondary literature from conferences,8 the creation of new knowledge on this subject matter is increasingly regional. This is due to a long history of shared socio-political experiences in Southeast Asia. Tagliacozzo terms this the *longue durée* 9 , an expression referring to the length of shared history of the region, as explained by Fernand Braudelian.

Apart from addressing scholarship based on this regional scale, there are practical reasons for the birth of this bibliography. First, many of the previous listings focused on holdings in overseas libraries. None showcased the richness, or limitations, of the libraries of Singapore. Singapore was a historical point of reference for wealthy Hadhrami Arabs as well as home to their publishing efforts. Furthermore, these Singaporean Hadhrami Arabs are interconnected to the wider network of Hadhramis in Southeast Asia.

Another pragmatic reason, as shown in listings by Roff and Mobini-Kesheh, the literature on the Hadhramis forms only a subset of a larger documentation of works on other ethnic groups such as the Malays. Thus, the tendency is to overlook Hadhrami sources within a larger corpus of Malay-Muslim literature. This bibliography is an attempt to highlight what lies hidden within this body of Malay literature and present it meaningfully.

#### ***Challenges***

One of the key challenges in the compilation of this bibliography was defining the scope of Hadhrami contributions to Southeast Asia within the vast body of Islamic literature in Southeast Asia. For example, the contributions of Hadhramis to Islam in Southeast Asia and Islamisation in the region in the 19th and 20th centuries are not mutually exclusive. As the *oeuvres* on Islamisation are too broad to be included in this bibliography, the selected Islamic literature of the region is directed at the role Hadhramis play.

The second challenge was defining the subject categories for the bibliography. No amount of planning or conceiving “standard” categories can replace the arduous process of reading and rereading the annotations for a more systematic, effective and meaningful way of grouping the literature on the subject. The parameters we have used to define the Hadhrami community for the purpose of this bibliography include perspectives from both the academic and the community. Such perspectives are merely guidelines to primarily frame and organise the materials selected for this bibliography. For this reason, we hope others find these subject categories useful.

The next challenge is maintaining consistencies in the spelling of Arabic terms, especially Arabic names in English. Apart from the terms used by authors and editors in the titles, we attempted to standardise these names and terms as much as possible. The different names and terms that were derived reflect the varying transliterations used in numerous time periods and various colonial experiences of Southeast Asian places and civilisations during the *longue durée*. Annotations follow the spellings that authors employed in their writings. For this, we seek our readers’ indulgence in the inconsistencies they may come across.

#### **Bibliographic Survey**

The study of Arabs in Southeast Asia is a study of Arab diasporas and communities living across the region. These diasporas are transnational or, for the pre-colonial era when nation-states had yet to exist, translocal.10 These Hadhrami diasporas retained their cultural identity based more on kinship and nasab (lineage) which formed the basis of a unique type of ‘*asabiyya* and less on language. According to Bajunid, the maintenance of this ‘*asabiyya* varies through three distinctive time periods in Southeast Asia: the precolonial, colonial and the post-colonial. Sources written on the subject also reflect this maintenance of identity, or threats to such displays of identity.11
