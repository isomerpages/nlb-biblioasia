It has been more than three months since the National Library reopened its doors and your response to the new library has been very encouraging indeed. With our wide variety of exhibitions and collections, a record breaking of 150,000 library users like yourself visited us. In the first two weeks, the daily number of visits averaged 7,000 on a weekday, and 9,000 on a weekend.

As much as we welcome the flood of visitors and reading enthusiasts, we have enjoyed and appreciated your feedback and suggestions. Many of you have complimented us on the extensive selection of materials and the excellent service given by the staff. For that, we thank you and we want to say it has been a real pleasure serving you. Your compliments, feedback and suggestions will spur us on to new and greater heights in providing for your needs. The National Library will continue to build on our collections and services so as to enrich your library experience.

Meanwhile, do take note in your diaries a very special date – our official opening on 12 November 2005. In conjunction with this momentous event, the National Library Board is organising a major library conference from 13 to 15 November 2005 on the theme “Celebrating Knowledge: The Power and Potential”. Join us in celebrating knowledge with international librarians and knowledge experts, who will gather to discuss topics of common interests. This knowledge-sharing opportunity will allow participants to learn from each other and bring home with them a wealth of information and experience. We are privileged to have Paul Saffo, Director of the Institute for the Future, to shed light on the future of the library. Joining him is Dr Susan Whitfield, who will speak on the International Dunhuang Project, a collaborative international digitisation project between the British Library, the National Library of China and a few other libraries. Dr Whitfield has also kindly agreed to speak to the public on Sunday, 13 November, 2005. Please look out for the details of this interesting talk, and sign up for it.
