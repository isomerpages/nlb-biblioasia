#### The former newsreader AGS Danaraj was also a pioneering town planner, who always made time to help the less fortunate.
By Edgar J. Danaraj

Some people might remember AGS Danaraj as a newsreader on radio and television in the 1960s and 1970s. But many might not know that beyond reading the news, Danaraj was an important figure in the development of Singapore’s urban landscape as one of the nation’s pioneering town planners.

#### **On the News**

Danaraj, who was my father, was a part-time radio and television newsreader with Radio Television Singapura and Singapore Broadcasting Cooperation for 19 years in the 1960s and 1970s.&nbsp; He spent two years on a government scholarship at Durham University in Britain from 1958 to 1960 to study town planning. His interest and love for journalism blossomed while he was there and he would freelance for newspapers during term breaks. He recalled, "I risked my life when I covered the Nottingham racial riots back in the 60s, but I loved every minute of it. I was paid about $50 to $200 for an article.”[^1]

When Danaraj returned to Singapore, he spoke with a British accent, commonly known as pure “received pronunciation” or “The Queen’s English”. This made his voice distinctive and easily recognised. After six months of training, he went on air.

Being a part-time newsreader could occasionally be harrowing. Once, he was so late for a news-reading session because of a traffic jam that he abandoned his car at Mount Alvernia and hailed a passing police car. He asked them for a ride to the broadcasting station and the police not only gave him a lift, they even sounded their sirens to get him there.[^2]&nbsp;

As a newsreader, Danaraj presented more than 38 broadcasts on radio and television. He covered a diverse range of topics, from “Redeveloping Toa Payoh”[^3] and “Rebuilding the City”[^4] to “Batik-Making”[^5] and “Keeping Birds as a Hobby”.[^6]

#### **Career: Planning a Nation**

Danaraj was born in Pahang, Malaysia in 1931. His family moved to Singapore in 1940, where he studied at St Andrew’s School from 1947–49.[^7] In 1950, when he was 19, he joined the Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT) as an officer and was a draughtsman of Sir George Pepler’s Diagnostic Survey Team, whose work involved the preparation of the 20-year Master Plan for Singapore. (Pepler was the Town Planning Consultant to the Singapore government).[^8] Danaraj was also part of the team that organised the exhibition “Homes of Singapore” held at the Victoria Concert Hall in 1951.[^9]

The objective of the Master Plan and survey was to propose land use on the island and act as a guide for its physical growth. Danaraj was part of the team that conducted an island-wide diagnostic survey of Singapore, surveying land and building use of both city and rural areas, as well as traffic flow. It provided detailed zoning and density parameters to guide the country’s physical development.[^10] The survey offered a summary of rural areas requiring improvement, identifying issues such as overcrowding, high congestion, housing, recreation for the growing population, sufficient land reserves, eliminating slums, and establishing a green belt around the city to limit urban sprawl.[^11]

After eight years at SIT, Danaraj received a two-year scholarship to the University of Durham King’s College in Britain in 1958.[^12] There, he completed his Diploma in Town Planning. During that time, he was influenced by modern town planning in other European countries such as France, Italy, Belgium and Germany.[^13] Upon his graduation in 1960, he joined the Planning Department within the Prime Minister’s Office[^14] and took on the role of central planning and commenced work to rebuild the city.[^15]

In 1960, Danaraj joined the Ministry of National Development as an executive planner. The ministry was responsible for shaping the physical development of urban areas, ensuring a balance between economic growth, social progress and environmental sustainability. He worked his way up to become a Senior Planner and later, Principal Planner. In 1972, the Singapore Institute of Planners (SIP) and Royal Town Planning Institute (UK) made Danaraj a Fellow in recognition of his contributions to the profession.[^16] In 1977, he was elected president of SIP,[^17] after serving as its council member (1975)[^18] and vice-president (1976).[^19] After two terms as president of SIP, he continued as chairman of its Practice, Membership and Education Committee in 1979/80. Danaraj was also involved in the formation of the ASEAN Association for Planning and Housing.[^20]

Danaraj was also deeply committed to growing and boosting the pool of town planners in Singapore. He was a part-time lecturer at the Faculty of Architecture at the University of Singapore.[^21] In his speech at SIP’s seventh annual dinner, Danaraj highlighted the role that town planners had in the proper development of the nation and thought that town planners could also work with other relevant professionals, such as architects, and offer their expertise and knowledge.[^22]

#### **Beyond the Call of Duty**

Despite his busy professional life, Danaraj made time to give back to society. [^23] He was an active and dedicated volunteer of the Singapore Red Cross Society, serving as chairman of its Property and Estates Committee since 1965.[^24] Danaraj also deployed his trained voice to good use as a master of ceremonies at numerous Red Cross functions and events.[^25] In appreciation of Danaraj’s contributions, the Singapore Red Cross awarded him its Meritorious Service Award in 1979.[^26]&nbsp;

His work with the Red Cross also gave him the opportunity to work closely with then President Yusof Ishak and First Lady Puan Noor Aishah. Danaraj and Puan Noor Aishah were involved in events such as a variety show raising funds for the Red Cross Children’s Home (1966) and Handicapped Children’s Club Christmas Party at the Red Cross House (1969).[^27]

Danaraj died in July 1981, at age 49, leaving behind his wife Lily Teo and two children, daughter Felicity and son, Edgar.[^28]

My late father was a truly loving man who always prioritised spending quality time with me and my elder sister, Felicity. He had an incredible sense of humour and never failed to make us laugh, filling our home with joy and warmth. His kindness and playful spirit are deeply missed, and the cherished memories of his smiling face will forever remain in our hearts.

<i>This article is dedicated, with the deepest gratitude and heartfelt remembrance, to the memory of the late Dr Malone-Lee Lai Choo, whose unwavering support was instrumental in shaping this work.</i>
