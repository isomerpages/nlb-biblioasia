Step into the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum and one of the first things that will catch your eye is a 10.6-metre-long skeleton of an adult female sperm whale, *Physeter macrocephalus* (Linnaeus, 1758), taking centre stage at the museum’s gallery.

She had been found drifting off the coast of Jurong Island in July 2015. According to the museum, she had probably been hit by a ship as her dorsal hindquarters had a large wound, with broken backbones below the injury.[^1]

Divers from the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore first secured the enormous specimen with ropes, before towing it carefully across the West Johor Strait to the Tuas Marine Transfer Station. There, museum scientists commenced the arduous process of examination, dissection and recovery of the whale for eventual display.[^2]

About eight months later, on 15 March 2016, Jubi Lee (thus named because she had been found the same year that the nation was celebrating its golden jubilee) was officially introduced to the public at the museum.

“As an older Singaporean, I am overjoyed by the return of a whale to our natural history museum,” declared Ambassador-at-Large Tommy Koh who was at the official launch.[^3] What Koh, who was the museum’s chairman, was alluding to was the fact that Jubi Lee’s skeleton is not the first whale skeleton to be exhibited in a museum in Singapore. Between 1907 and 1974, a 13-metre-long skeleton of a blue whale had been a popular attraction at the Raffles Museum (later renamed the National Museum).[^4]

#### **Ikan Besar Skali**

On 25 June 1892, the *Singapore Free Press* reported that the British steamer Bengkalis had spotted “a large whale” that was “stranded on the beach near the Kesang River, nine miles to the north of Muar”.[^5]

The whale was presumed to have washed ashore somewhere around Sebatu, about 30 kilometres south of Melaka, eight days prior. It ultimately drew its last breath on 23 June 1892. According to the *Straits Times Weekly Issue*, the “fish of monstrous size (*ikan besar skali*)” was found to have measured 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and was “rather offensive and swollen with gases from decomposition”. The locals who encountered the specimen could not “call to mind ever having seen such a creature before”.[^6]

D.F.A. Hervey, the resident councillor of Melaka, presented the local *penghulu* (chieftain) with a *hadiah* (gift) in exchange for the whale remains, which Hervey decided to preserve and convey to Singapore. A *pagar* (barrier) had been constructed around the carcass to “prevent it from getting washed back into the sea while the labourers worked” to dissect and prepare the remains for transportation.[^7]

These arrived in Singapore later that year and was acquired by the Raffles Library and Museum (now the National Museum of Singapore) on Stamford Road. While the whale skeleton would go on to become one of the museum’s most iconic exhibits, it took 15 more years for it to see the light of day.

Owing to a lack of space in the building, the whale skeleton was locked up in a shed behind the museum compound before it was displayed. Knowledge about its origin and biology was at the time comparably obscure, admitted Karl R. Hanitsch, the museum’s curator and first director. Hanitsch and his staff quickly recognised that “more room” and “a number of much-needed alterations” were essential.[^8]

Countless negotiations and debates ensued over the next several years. At last, a compromise was reached in 1904. The existing museum building was to be extended, with construction works commencing the same year and wrapping up in 1906.

Thereafter, “a massive reorganisation was undertaken”, during which time the natural history specimens were refurbished and the large central gallery on the upper floor was designated as the home of the new zoological collection. Coinciding with the start of the Lunar New Year, the Raffles Museum reopened its doors to an “over-flowing by dense masses” of visitors on 13 February 1907.[^9]

One particular exhibit stole the limelight. After years spent tucked away, the enormous skeleton of the beached whale finally made its public debut.

#### **Whale Skeleton Reels in Visitors**

Fitted with steel ropes, the skeleton hung proudly from the ceiling of the newly refurbished natural history room at the Raffles Museum. Assembling and mounting it was no easy task, and Hanitsch credited the ingenuity and hard work of the museum’s chief taxidermist Valentine Knight, his assistant Percy de Fontaine and their staff for finding workarounds in the process. The specimen had a couple of missing bones, including a scapula, the “hands”, and various vertebrae and ribs.[^10]

With assistance from John Hewitt of the Sarawak Museum and Edgar Thurston of the Madras Museum, the Raffles Museum team took measurements and drawings of existing whale specimens and used them to model these missing bones in papier-mâché. Only then was the full skeleton made available for viewing.[^11]

Because this occurred before the advent of DNA technology, it took Hanitsch and his team several years before they could accurately identify the mammal. In an earlier report, Hanitsch had originally suspected the specimen to be that of a humpback whale, or Megaptera boops (Van Beneden &amp; Gervais, 1880), but his subsequent morphological analyses would have been at odds with this earlier study. Further work allowed him to correctly identify the specimen as belonging to Balaenoptera indica (Blyth, 1859), which has since been synonymised as B. musculus (Linnaeus, 1758), more commonly known as the blue whale.[^12]

The whale skeleton sparked significant interest and excitement among visitors. When the exhibit was being set up, an elderly Malay man came by and offered a first-hand account of the beaching of the whale. “Bukan satu kapal. Satu ikan!” (“Not a boat. A fish!”). He was, however, wrong on both counts – it was neither a boat nor a fish.[^13]

The whale spawned a tale that was peppered with riveting detail. “Malays…  told their boys the true story of the monster whale whose skeleton hangs suspended near the turtles. How the poor beast was stranded near Malacca and a pagar built promptly around him when for three days his bull-like roars terrified the neighbourhood, then silence and in seven days a corpse.”[^14]

The giant skeleton also attracted international visitors from the wider scientific community. These included William Brigham, the American botanist and ethnologist and founding director of the Bernice P. Bishop Museum in Honolulu. Brigham, who had been on an inspection tour around the world, stopped by the Raffles Museum in 1912. He wrote about the whale in a “handsomely illustrated report”.
