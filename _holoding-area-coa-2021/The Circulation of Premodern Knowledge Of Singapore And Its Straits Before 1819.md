#### **Introduction**

In 1907, the British colonial official Frank Swettenham expressed his
surprise that in the 600 years between the fall of Temasek and the founding
of a trading post on the island, no European had enough curiosity and
application to learn about Singapore’s history nor recognised its potential
as a strategic site.1 Swettenham was implicitly suggesting that there was
knowledge in circulation. All it took was a little snooping about, and he was
right; references to Singapore or its straits can be easily found in European
literature before 1819.

Swettenham was not the only one to have recognised these references.
Other scholars had too, but they were disparaging of their value. Kenneth
Tregonning, then Raffles Professor of History at the University of
Singapore, famously dismissed the study of precolonial Singapore in 1969
as being of no relevance and “of antiquarian interest only”.2 Later historians such as Mary Turnbull and Lim Joo-Jock were equally unenthusiastic about
a search for Singapore’s older roots, adding that the historical record relating
to Singapore and its straits before the 19th century was not only scarce but
also fragmentary, vague and contradictory.3 Not only was making sense of
these references of premodern Singapore discouraged, it was also seen as
unfashionable and unprofitable.4

However, the scholarship in the past three decades has challenged these
assumptions. Archaeological work and archival research, in particular, have
shown that there was a thriving settlement and that precolonial Singapore
was not as irrelevant as once assumed.5 As more testimonies come to light,
historians are now working towards unifying them into the longer narrative
of Singapore’s past.6 Despite this progress, we have yet to tackle these
references found in European literature, as hinted at by Swettenham long
ago. Hence the objective of this paper is to collect these references related to
Singapore and its straits in European literature and question whether they
are as scarce, fragmentary, vague and contradictory as formerly supposed.

Lim Joo-Jock had in 1991 suggested two possible approaches: either one
can summarise all the available evidence and present them in chronological
order, or one can focus on the tangible pieces and draw a series of insights
from them.7 Sophie Sim has rightly deemed these approaches insufficient,
because they lack critical analysis and fail to deal with the power and
ambiguities of memory.8 Here I adapt these suggestions and perspectives in
the following manner. First, I quantify the references about Singapore or its
straits in European literature, focusing on the genre of these publications, the languages they were published in, and their growth in numbers by
the century. What emerges is clear: these references are not as scarce as
previously thought. Second, through a close reading of these references in
European literature, I present the impressions a European reader would have
had of Singapore before 1819. Finally, in putting these references together
across three centuries, I argue that they should not be dismissed, because
they offer us ways to rethink Singapore’s history and contain important
clues for charting the future of Singapore’s pasts.

#### **Quantifying Knowledge**

Unlike what earlier historians have suggested, references to Singapore
and its straits are both copious and varied. Today we can count close to
400 published works that include a reference to either Singapore or its
straits before 1819, sometimes both, and these works range from chronicles
and travelogues to poetry and fiction. The large number of publications
containing references shows that there was sufficient knowledge circulating
in European literature. Several of these, like European travelogues, sailing
rutters, and chronicles have been explored in detail and have been used
to reconstruct Singapore’s past before 1819. Other references can be found
in religious accounts, magazines, pamphlets, periodicals, journals, plays
and anthologies, but not all have been studied in detail. The sheer number
of references points to a widespread cognizance of Singapore, if not of
the region. A very large number of references (about 153) are contained
in compendia, a category that has escaped attention so far. Comprising
publications such as geographies, cosmographies, dictionaries, lexicons and
encyclopaedias, the compendia helped condense and transmit knowledge of
Singapore and showed how the general reader understood “Singapore” at a
particular point in time.

Singapore and its straits feature several times in fiction, such as in the
novels of Daniel Defoe, and can be found in Spanish, Portuguese and
Dutch poems as well.9 Despite the small number of such publications (about 16 so far), they point to creative imaginings of Singapore before the modern
period.10 Another important genre of knowledge is the travel anthology.
Narratives and accounts were plucked from different sources spanning
various languages, regions and periods, and compiled into volumes of
collected travels. Europe has a long tradition of publishing collected travel
accounts, which were often lavishly illustrated and extremely costly.11 By the
18th century, the genre gained popularity and increased in circulation. For
example, the four-volume travel compendium, A Collection of Voyages and
Travels, first issued in 1704 by the brothers Awnsham and John Churchill,
was reprinted with two additional volumes in 1732. A third edition appeared
in 1744–46, followed by a fourth in 1752, published by the bookseller
Thomas Osborne.12 Although this repackaging increased the spread of
knowledge of Singapore and its straits, it also had the effect of recycling
existing knowledge for new readers.

These references are also found in different languages and point to a
wide dispersion and transmission of knowledge across Europe. There is
a substantial number of references to Singapore and its straits in Latin,
especially in the 16th century, when Latin functioned as a scholarly language
for learning. Latin publications with references to Singapore were often
initially textual aids to cartographic material. Later Latin publications
provided more detail, with many describing Singapore as a city within the
Kingdom of Siam. An important work written in Latin were the letters of
St. Francis Xavier (1506–52), a celebrated Jesuit who travelled to the Far
East. His letters dispatched when he was anchored off Singapore (“ex freto
Syncapurano”, Latin for “from the Straits of Singapore”) helped reinforce the
knowledge in religious circles that Singapore was an important station up
to the 19th century.13 After 1650, the Romance and Germanic vernaculars
began to replace Latin, and more references to Singapore appeared in
publications in Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, French, English, German and Dutch. At present, there are many collected publications in English and
French, but larger-than-expected numbers in these languages might simply
reflect current digitisation efforts. It is clear from tracing the circulation
of information that these references were often drawn from a similar set
of sources. For example, English descriptions of the Malay Peninsula,
Singapore and its straits depended heavily on information provided by
English travellers such as William Dampier and Alexander Hamilton. On
the other hand, French publications relied on knowledge translated into
French. Pierre d’Avity’s Le Monde (The World), a popular and widely read
publication in the early 17th century, contains references to Singapore
and the wider straits region. But a closer examination shows that this
information was extensively compiled from the works of the Portuguese
historian João de Barros and the French Jesuit Pierre du Jarric.14 This overreliance
on a few transmitted sources perhaps testifies to how little was
known in England and France about Singapore and its straits before 1819.

Finally, references to Singapore and its straits increased from the 16th
to 18th century, which reflected developments in the print industry and
the growing demand for travel literature. In the 16th century, references
to Singapore and its straits were still limited to the Portuguese chronicles,
translated or otherwise, and a few religious accounts. This number increased
with time. By the 1560s, an increasing number of cosmographies and
geographies, mostly written in Latin, became popular, a development that
mirrored the broader curiosity and interest in the wider world. By the end
of the 17th century, references that touch on Singapore and its straits had
doubled in number. This growth was spurred by the increasing voyages to
and writing of the East and also by the development of the book trade in
major centres such as London, Paris and the Low Countries.15 As Daniel
Roche has shown, European printers published 1,566 travelogues in the
17th century compared to 456 a century before. By the end of the 18th
century, the number of travelogues had more than doubled to 3,540. This
development added considerably to the knowledge base of Singapore and the wider straits region.16 The 18th century was the age when knowledge of
Singapore and its straits reached the growing masses. Technical innovations
in publishing, increased mobility, the development of scientific societies,
and an expanding base of readership meant that more references than before
reached curious audiences.

#### **Qualifying Knowledge**

However, the number of references to Singapore and/or its straits does not
always mean that they contain a wealth of detail. Many publications contain
no more than a name and tell us little about the island or its history. That
said, regardless of length and detail, the reader of the literature would have
possibly formed four impressions of Singapore. These impressions were
consistent within European publications before 1819 and can be summed as
such: Singapore was a place of danger, division, antiquity and concentration.
The impressions occasionally overlap but hardly deviate from these patterns
of description.

***A place of danger***

The immediate impression a reader would have had of Singapore and its
straits was that it was a place of great danger. A combination of fierce
storms, difficult seascape, and vulnerability to ambush led the area around
Singapore, in particular its channel, to gain a certain notoriety. The
Portuguese writers João de Barros and Brás de Albuquerque referred to
Singapore as *falsa demora*, which meant a tricky place to interrupt one’s
voyage or a place where ships were lost while waiting.17 Irregular and rapid
tides, hidden sandbanks and treacherous rocks made navigation risky and
caused many ships to meet with shipwreck. The ships carrying the Japanese
Tenshō embassy to Rome in 1584 met with such a mishap, hitting a shallow rock in the Singapore straits and losing their valuable cargo, although the
crew was thankfully saved from danger.18 Another account was penned
by the Spanish Dominican priest Domingo Navarrete, who crossed the
straits of Singapore around the mid-17th century. Navarrete wrote, too,
about how other sailors in Canton faced difficulties in sailing through the
narrow passage and overdramatised the violent currents that “whirl’d a
ship about with its sails abroad”.19 When the Italian priest Matteo Ripa
travelled from Melaka to Manila in 1708, the Armenian ship he was on
hit submerged rocks in shallow waters and was about to founder off the
island of Singapore. Matteo was said to have performed a miracle, and the
ship eventually sailed on safely.20 These three incidents from three different
centuries are some of the many incidents that made plain to readers the
dangers of geography around Singapore.

There were also numerous instances of local attacks on Europeans in
the Singapore region. Readers today would be familiar with the account
of Jacques de Coutre (not published until the 20th century), who was
ambushed by Orang Laut vessels off present-day Sentosa in the 17th
century.21 Yet his account was not unique. European readers back then
could read the account of Portuguese priest Melchior Barreto, who was
attacked en route to Macao in the 16th century. When Barreto’s Portuguese
caravel ran aground in the Singapore straits in April 1555, the party was
attacked by 50 local Orang Laut perahu22 that fell upon them with loud
screams.23 Occasionally, the area in and around Singapore was the setting
for battles between Malay kingdoms and became perilous for Europeans
caught in the crossfire. For example, the Spanish Friar Diego Aduarte witnessed 80 large galleys belonging to the Sultan of Aceh pitched for battle
in the Singapore straits against those of Johor.24 The incoming Governor of
Macao, Antonio de Albuquerque Coelho, who wintered in Johor in 1717,
wrote his account of Raja Kecil of Siak, who assembled a large and powerful
fleet at the mouth of the Singapore straits in preparation to conquer Johor.25
These accounts in European literature undoubtedly helped to shape the
perception of Singapore and its straits as a place of mortal danger.

***A place of division***

As geographical knowledge expanded with discovery and conquest,
early European cartographers and geographers tried to reconcile the new
information with existing knowledge from ancient Ptolemaic geography. As
sailors relied on visual landmarks to navigate past the maze of islands at the
tip of the Malay Peninsula, prominent outcroppings such as Batu Berlayar
(Batu Berlayar Point, Labrador Park) and Pedra Branca, as well as hilly
landforms such as Mount Berbukit (Bukit Pelali, Pengarang) and Romania
Point (Tanjung Penyusop) in the region became important navigation
markers. This information likely circulated back to Europe and created the
misperception that one of the elevated landforms was Singapore, which
agreed with Ptolemy’s 2nd-century description of a cape and city located at
the southernmost tip of Asia. Singapore thus came to be referenced as a cape
from the 16th century onwards.

Singapore’s mistaken identification as a prominent promontory in texts
and maps led to it being taken as a notional marker of division. Singapore
was cited in the Portuguese poem, *Os Lusíadas* by Luís Vaz de Camões
(1572), as a turning point, and João de Barros’s *Da Ásia* (1562) divided the
sixth and the seventh part of the East Indies from “Cape Singapura”.26
This divisional marker was adopted by later writers such as Faria y Sousa
(1666–75) and the geographer Pierre Duval, the editor of François Pyrard’s travelogue (1679).27 Other writers made this distinction for practical
reasons, since two maritime zones (the South China Sea and the Bay of
Bengal) overlapped around the Singapore region.28 This idea of transition
is memorably expressed in Albuquerque’s *Commentaries* (1576), which
referenced Portuguese ships arriving at the “gate” (*porta*) of Singapore,
demarcating a point of crossing.29 The repeated assertions created by
cartography and writing reinforced the mental geography of Singapore
and its straits as a dividing point between two different regions of Asia
(Figure 1).

Besides dividing the two maritime zones, the “cape” of Singapore
was also seen as separating the Asian mainland from the island world
of Southeast Asia, notably from Sumatra and Java. Thomas Herbert’s
observation that Singapore was a former trading town that marked the
southernly cape of the Asian continent and divided it from Sumatra was a
common impression at the time. This statement would become the standard
definition in most encyclopaedia and dictionary entries in the 18th century.30
These assumptions of Singapore as a cape and dividing marker came to be
deeply entrenched in European thought and proved resilient well into the
19th century.
