Soon after Singapore gained independence in 1965, the government announced that English would be the *lingua franca* that would unite the linguistically diverse 
population. But attempts to forge a common language in Singapore had begun as early as the 19th century, when Chinese migrants to Singapore – the majority of 
whom spoke Southern Min dialects (闽南语) such as Hokkien1 – tried to communicate with the Malay-speaking indigenous population. Several Chinese-Malay dictionaries – listing Malay words with their equivalent 
terms in Chinese – were produced in the 19th century.2
One of the earliest was *Hua yi tong yu* (华夷通语), published in 1883.

This earliest known Singapore-published Chinese-Malay dictionary in the National Library’s collection contains more than 2,800 entries in 25 categories. The entries include terms used in disciplines such as cosmology and geography to mathematics as well as common business terms. The second section categorises the entries 
according to the number of Chinese characters contained in each term, while the third and final section lists verbs and adjectives that could not be categorised in the preceding two sections.3

In the preface penned by Zuo Binglong (左秉隆), the first Chinese Consul to Singapore appointed by the Qing Imperial Court, the writer explains that the dictionary was necessary because large numbers of Chinese 
migrants had settled in Nanyang (南洋 or the “South Seas”) to trade with the Malays in the region. Since the migrants – mainly from the Zhangzhou and Quanzhou regions of Fujian province and Chaozhou in Guangdong 
province – could not conduct their business effectively due to their inability to speak Malay, a dictionary was needed.

The author, Lin Hengnan (林衡南), came 
up with an ingenious solution by devising 
a system that uses native Southern Min 
dialects to phoneticise Malay words. The 
dictionary teaches users how to pronounce 
Malay words by using Chinese characters that sound similar when said in the 
Southern Min dialects.4
 For example, to 
learn the Malay word satu, which means 
”one”, Lin used the Chinese characters 
“沙诛” – pronounced sha zhu in Mandarin 
but sa tu in Hokkien. Tiga, or “three”, is 
“知迓” – pronounced zhi ya in Mandarin but 
ti ga in Hokkien.5
To render the phoneticisation more 
accurate, Lin indicated the tone of the Chinese 
character to be used when pronounced using 
Southern Min dialects. He also switched 
between the tones of the Zhangzhou, Quanzhou and Chaozhou dialects as needed to 
ensure that the words were pronounced 
correctly in Malay.6
