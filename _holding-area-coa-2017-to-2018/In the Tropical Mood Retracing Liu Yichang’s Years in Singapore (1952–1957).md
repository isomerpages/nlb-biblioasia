#### **Introduction**
In 2000, a new generation was introduced to Hong Kong writer Liu
Yichang (刘以鬯, 7 December 1918 – 8 June 2018) through the technicoloursaturated
imagery of Wong Kar Wai’s *In the Mood* for Love and *2046*, two
films inspired by Liu’s seminal novels *Tête-bêche* (《对倒》) and *The Drinker*
(《酒徒》, which was considered the first stream-of-consciousness Chinese
novel) respectively. The films’ protagonist, a cigarette-puffing newspaper
editor and pulp-novelist played by actor Tony Leung, was also loosely based
on Liu himself.

Wong’s films may have been set in Hong Kong in the 1960s, but the prime
of Liu’s life had been a decade earlier in Singapore in the 1950s, where he,
aged 34, experienced the golden era of Singapore’s tabloids, was initiated
into the glitzy *getai* (歌台, live revue) world, fell in love with a beautiful
songstress and married a dancer with a beautiful heart.

The diasporic twinning of Hong Kong and Malaya due to political and
historical events of the time created a wealth of opportunities that prompted
the exchange of commerce, talents and culture. Malaya’s post-war demand
for Chinese talents in the publishing and entertainment industries had made
Liu’s, and his wife’s, brief stint in Malaya possible, thereby shaping his
personal and literary life forever.

In 1952, Liu was headhunted to join the high-profile but short-lived paper
*Ih Shih Pao* (益世报, ISP) in Singapore. He returned to Hong Kong in 1957,
ill and disillusioned, after several false starts at establishing his newspaper
career. From then on, Liu, as a novelist based in Hong Kong, continued
a long and prolific relationship with Singapore’s *Nanyang Siang Pau*,
publishing more than 60 Malayan short stories between 1958 and 1959,
followed by an unbroken serialisation of 55 novels from 1970 to 1985,
out of which three were set in Singapore.

On the occasion of his centenary, my paper retraces Liu’s Malayan years and
attempts to make sense of his life and time here through newspaper archives,
newly unearthed novels and published works, as well as interviews with his
wife and close friends in Singapore.

This paper examines the overlapping influence of the two distinct but
connected worlds that Liu Yichang inhabited in Singapore, specifically the
tabloid industry and *getai* inner circle, which led to the intertwining of the
two personas in his inner world, namely the “newspaper man” (报人, often
featured in his stories and novels) and the “storyteller who entertained the
public” (娱乐大众的小说家). A chronicler of mid-20th-century Singapore
society, Liu created a rich body of Malayan work that, though sadly neglected,
deserves to be preserved and celebrated as part of our cultural heritage.

#### **First Cut is the Deepest**

In June 1952, Liu Yichang had been living in a room on the fourth floor of
Nanyang Khek Community Guild (南洋客属总会) when he came to head
the *Fukan* (副刊, supplement) of the new Chinese newspaper, *Ih Shih Pao*.1
A 10-minute walk down Peck Seah Street, a left turn on Gopeng Street and a right turn took him to his office on Anson Road. He had arrived in
Singapore with four Hong Kong veteran editors, Chung Wen Ling
(钟文苓), Liu Wenqu (刘问渠), Zhao Shixun (赵世洵) and Zhang Bingzhi
(张冰之). Together, they were known as the Five Tigers from Hong Kong.
The newspaper was launched on 7 June 1952, and a well-attended cocktail
party was held at the Cathay Restaurant on 14 June. At the occasion were
the who’s who of Singapore – government officials, Chinese community
leaders and business organisation representatives.2 The paper’s future looked
promising. Liu Yichang did not expect to lose his first job in Singapore in
less than four months.

On 13 October 1952, *Nanyang Siang Pau* (NYSP) reported the abrupt closure
of Liu’s paper: “At 6am yesterday, *Ih Shih Pao* locked down its office and
posted a notice announcing the suspension of its operation.” The headline
read: “Three Years of Preparation and They Lasted Four Months”. Fortyseven
of the 120 workers were editorial staff and all had been locked out
of the building with their personal belongings still inside. Some journalists
only found out that they were out a job after they had returned from
their assignments.3

Liu should have seen it coming. The paper had already run into financial
difficulty barely a month after its launch, and, from mid-August, was unable
to pay its employees.4 Three editorial staff, including Zhao Shixun and Chin
Kah Chong (陈加昌, who joined Pan-Asia News Agency in 1955 and became
Singapore’s first Vietnam War correspondent), submitted a letter signed
by all staff to the labour office to seek recourse in recouping salaries and
severance pay owed to them.5

The exact dates and chronology of Liu’s movements during this time are
muddled. Liu’s biographer, Yi Mingshan (易明善), wrote that the paper had
run into dire financial difficulty by end July. Liu and his four Hong Kong
colleagues negotiated with the publisher and, failing to get him to sort out the finances, quit and left (“罢笔而去，离开《益世报》”). B.H. Tay, a
Singapore Chinese-newspaper historian, however, wrote that the editors had
merely gone on “strike” (实行“罢笔”).6 Yi also wrote that “After leaving *Ih
Shih Pao* by end July, Liu was welcome onboard [at] *Sin Lit Pau* (新力报) as
its chief editor”.7 But ISP’s assistant manager had told NYSP two days after
ISP’s shutdown that “they had notified immigration authorities to prohibit
the Hong Kong employees from staying in Singapore”,8 suggesting that Liu
and the other Hong Kong editors had still been in ISP’s employ until its
closure in October.

One can only imagine Liu’s devastation – the sudden shock of losing his
job, the anger at being unpaid for months (Liu was also battling his ex-wife
over alimony during this time9), and being told that he could no longer stay
in Singapore. A *Lianhe Zaobao* write up on ISP’s rout quoted a line from
Liu’s story “Old Wong” (老王): “It was a weekend afternoon. I walked to
work and was shocked to see the news centre’s door tightly shut…it felt like
someone had punched me in the stomach…everything around me suddenly
lost its balance”.10

The unfortunate debacle at ISP was to set the tone for Liu’s news career in
Malaya over the next six years, playing out against the exciting but volatile
backdrop of the 1950s Chinese tabloid boom. This tide had brought Liu to
Singapore’s shores, but it would also slosh him around from paper to paper.
In Liu’s words, “It was hard for tabloids to survive. After one collapsed,
another one would soon be set up, but it wouldn’t be long before it also
went down”.11
