#### Singapore’s Central Business District didn’t happen by accident. **Lim Tin Seng** recounts how a piece of prime land dubbed as “Golden Shoe” was transformed into a glittering financial hub.

Singapore’s waterfront has seen a remarkable transformation over the last 50 years, marked by the soaring glass-and-concrete towers of Raffles Place and Shenton Way on the one hand to the vast expanse of shimmering Marina Bay on the other, framing the new extension of the Central Business District (CBD). Older skyscrapers such as One Raffles Place (formerly OUB Centre; 1986), UOB Plaza (1992) and Republic Plaza (1995) – all scaling 280 metres, the maximum height allowed in Singapore – hold their own against the shiny new rivals of Marina Bay, led by Marina Bay Sands and the Marina Bay Financial Centre.

All this is testament to the success of the city-state’s urban renewal programme that began in the late 1960s – in a pocket of prime real estate known as the “Golden Shoe”. Golden Shoe may seem like a rather grandiose label today but in post-Independent Singapore, it came to express the ambitious plans of a nascent city that had set its sights on being a major financial centre.
