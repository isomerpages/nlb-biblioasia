#### The Business Collection aims to be the premier stop for professionals, managers, executives and businessmen operating or venturing into local, Asian and overseas markets.

With rapid globalisalion, technological innovations and the emergence of new economic powerhouses, businesses are now operating in an ever-changing and increasingly complicated landscape. Given Singapore's free market system and outward orientation, it is especially critical for local businesses to keep abreast of the most recent developments to ensure timely strategic planning. In order to retain their competitive edge, it is imperative that businesses have ready-access to up-to-date, timely and relevant information on the latest policy changes, market trends, economic news and investment opportunities.

Therefore, the Business Collection of the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library aims to be the premier stop for both local and foreign professionals, managers, executives and businessmen operating or venturing into local, Asian and other overseas markets. Targeted at business practitioners (executives and entrepreneurs) and practical researchers (management consultants, business analysts, policy-makers, financial journalists and business students), the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library strives to meet the information needs of library users by housing an extensive Business Collection on Level 8.

Focusing primarily on the Asia Pacific, Europe and North America regions, the 26,000-strong collection boasts of comprehensive and updated directories, market research reports, statistical and financial sources. It also includes more than 400 trade and business journal titles, world business news as well as management best practices in both print and electronic formats.

#### **Access and Collection Highlights**
The Business Collection's monographs and journal titles are shelved in distinct sections as open access materials and arranged according the Dewey Decimal Classification (DOC) system. Business journal titles and annual reports of Singapore listed companies, selected foreign listed companies and some international organisations are located along the bookwall spanning one end of the library. All business materials are listed as "RBUS" under "Lee Kong Chian Reference Library" branch in the Library's online catalogue (<a href="https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/home">https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/home</a>).

Notable highlights of the collections include a wide range of titles on modem management and economics topics, such as: Economics, Finance, Banking and Investment. International Economics, Entrepreneurship and Business Enterprises, Industries, Business Law, International Trade, Personal Success, Accounting and Auditing, Management, Advertising and Personal Relations.

To supplement the print collection, the Library offers numerous valuable business databases  from reputable companies and information aggregators. At a nominal usage charge of S$0.03 per minute and S$O.30 for printing per page, business researchers, entrepreneurs and students can search for accurate and timely business and market information.
