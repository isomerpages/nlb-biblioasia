description: "The early part of the 20th century saw a conservative shift
  towards the teaching of English to native subjects. This was contrary to the
  19th century when the teaching of English was seen as an imperative civilising
  force â€“ a tool for the enlightenment of the savage barbarians that the British
  ruled over in their colonies. "
