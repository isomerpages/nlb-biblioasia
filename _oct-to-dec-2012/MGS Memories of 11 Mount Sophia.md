#### Founded in 1887, the Methodist Girls’ School (MGS) is among the oldest and most established schools in Singapore. Barbara Quek, a former MGS student, shares with us the history of the school and memories that left a deep imprint on many who passed through its doors.

It was a sentimental Sunday on 3 June 2012 when MGS and the Alumnae Association jointly held an Open House Day and Remembrance Ceremony to bid a final farewell to their former school site at 11 Mount Sophia.

The occasion was a bittersweet homecoming experience for the hundreds of old girls and their families who congregated in the packed hall at the basement area of the former Ellice Handy Building. Since the relocation of MGS in 1992 to 11 Blackmore Drive, succeeding occupants of 11 Sophia included churches and other schools before it was leased to Old School (http://www.oldschool.sg) in 2007. This unprecedented gathering of the MGS family was prompted by the expiration of the lease for Old School at the end of June 2012. It marked the closing of a chapter in history as the site made way for redevelopment plans under the 2008 Master Plan of the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA).


#### **Remembering Roots**

Originally known as Bukit Seligi or Seligi Hill, Mount Sophia was also called Sophia Hill. Seligi is the nibong palm used locally in flooring and fishing stakes. One might casually assume that Mount Sophia Road was named after the school’s founder Sophia Blackmore – much like the naming of Blackmore Drive. However, this affiliation of place to person is mere coincidence as the name “Mount Sophia” was in use prior to Sophia Blackmore’s arrival in Singapore. The hill was, in fact, named in honour of Lady Sophia, the second wife of Sir Stamford Raffles, the founder of Singapore, by Captain William Flint, Raffles’ brotherin-law. “Sophia” was also the middle-name of Flint’s daughter, Mary Sophia Anne.

The impending loss of the former school site, a significant historical landmark perched on a hilltop overlooking bustling Orchard Road, ignited debate across various social media. Former school sites conserved for heritage and commercial use, such as the former St Joseph Institution (SJI) at Bras Basah Road or Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus (CHIJ) at CHIJMES, might have given some hope for a similar fate.

The school’s history could be traced back to 1887 when Sophia Blackmore, an Australian missionary, came to Singapore on a personal calling to provide girls with an opportunity for education. MGS had a humble beginning as the Tamil Girls’ School at a rent-free shop house at Short Street. The school began with a pioneer batch of nine Indian girls, whose businessmen fathers wanted them to be brought up as young women of worth to society. Nonya, Chinese and Eurasian girls also enrolled over time. The school relocated to Middle Road while awaiting the completion of a larger building on Short Street. Then, increased student numbers and space constraints necessitated the move to Mount Sophia where it remained until 1992. Overcrowding and new school demands eventually dictated another shift to its current campus at Blackmore Drive.

From the 1960s through to the 1990s, before the implementation of the Direct School Admission (DSA)2 , most MGS girls enjoyed a full 10-year stint at Mount Sophia from primary school through to secondary school. Set up as a mission school, the Christian education continues to be the hallmark of MGS. An old girl from the last batch of Senior Cambridge girls to graduate in 1941 before the Japanese Occupation remembered how she had carefully glued a “yellowed with age…cyclostyled paper”3 printed with the old pre-war school song to the last page of her old chapel book, *The Abingdon song book*. The red-covered *Hymnal for youth* (1941) was synonymous with worship service at Mount Sophia from the 1960s to the 1980s. This was replaced by a new Y-generation hymn book when the former went out of print.
Tucked away from the hustle and bustle of city streets, a tranquil hilltop haven which once overlooked Eu Tong Sen’s majestic Eu Villa and the treetops of the Istana, MGS Mount Sophia was a “lovely collection of quaint old buildings, ranging from bricked bungalows and colonial structures with high ceilings, sweeping staircases and long verandahs to 1950s style classrooms with French doors covered in green glass, and bare cement floors”.4

Taking its pride of place at Mount Sophia is Olson Building, the oldest in the cluster, the “only one grand dame” that is “to be retained and integrated with new developments in the future”.5 Named after one of the school’s former principals, Mary Olson, this “old girl”, constructed in 1928, has been earmarked for conservation. Responding to queries on why the 84-year old Olson Building was so special, URA spokesman explained that it was “selected because of conservation merits such as a high-pitched tiled roof, elegant geometric masonry corbels (stone brackets), moulded concrete lattices and concrete louvred vents – all visually interesting and suited to a tropical climate”.6

The story of MGS at Mount Sophia is incomplete without some tribute to Nind Home, a boarding house for girls built by the Methodist Mission, and where Sophia Blackmore had worked and stayed. In a memorable speech at the dedication service for the opening of the Ellice Handy Building, the late Mrs Ellice Handy7 shared that the top of Mount Sophia first belonged to Nind Home, “a happy family of nearly 100 girls, sometimes more, and we came from all races…Those were happy days when there was little pressure and plenty of leisure”.8 Nind Home became a part of MGS but was demolished after the war in 1947 when the structure was deemed unsafe. Built in its place was the Sophia Blackmore Memorial Hall.

With the completion of the Kenyon Building named after another principal, Carrie Kenyon, in 1933, MGS started a twosession school. Before its demolition in the late 1970s, this eight-classroom block at the foot of Mount Sophia leading down to Adis Road claimed its fair share of ghost stories – especially those of haunted toilets. The sturdy monkey bars, swings and see-saws were dearly missed when it was subsequently pulled down to make way for a new multi-storey primary school complex. More memories include picking bright red saga seeds in the playfield behind this old Kenyon block.

The Japanese Occupation from 1942-1945 brought schooling to a halt. MGS was renamed Mount Sophia Girls’ School and recorded its lowest attendance of 15 students and a teaching staff of 7 in 1944.

A new horizon awaited post-war MGS in 1945 when the school was reinstated and Mrs Handy became the principal, a position she helmed from 1946 to 1957 during her 51 years of service. The appointment was a historic milestone as she was the first MGS student as well as the first Asian and Singaporean principal of the school. Hers was a tall order to see through the rebuilding of the school after bombs had destroyed some buildings. The sprawling site was scarred by war, dotted with fox holes and lined with slit trenches. Under her dedicated guidance, the Mary Nind Wing was built and housed secondary classes in 1952, followed on a year later by the Sophia Blackmore Memorial Hall. The building program was completed in 1955 with the Louise McKee Wing9 , tuck shop extension and caretakers’ quarters. Mrs Handy had lasting memories of this journeying because “MGS is very dear to me, especially this hilltop on which MGS has finally established itself after many moves in her lifetime”, when “MGS was all in one place now on Mount Sophia”.10

*“I remember being told that at 12 midnight one would hear ‘noise’. Never one to believe such myths and tall stories, I would stay behind in school for campfires overnight and other events past midnight without giving it much thought. One night, I actually heard feet shuffling and desks being moved! Later I was told that the low brick wall in front of the main entrance where the MGS signage stood was the site of a grave. That really kept me on my guard each time we had Girl Guide camps! This story about ghosts and burial grounds at Mount Sophia was not without some history. The Japanese took over Nind Home and made it their Headquarters during the Occupation years. During that time, MGS was used to house prisoners and it was possible that those who died were buried nearby. This might account for the strange going-on at midnight!” *
