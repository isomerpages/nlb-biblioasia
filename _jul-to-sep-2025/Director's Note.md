This year, 2025, the National Library Board (NLB) celebrates its 30th anniversary. The [NLB was formed in 1995](https://staging-lite.d3lqsdaf68v737.amplifyapp.com/vol-21/issue-2/jul-sep-2025/formation-national-library-board/), a move that was recommended in the landmark Library 2000 report. Of course, while the statutory board is three decades old, the history of the National Library goes back much further. As early as 1819, Stamford Raffles had envisaged a library in Singapore to “collect the scattered literature and traditions of the country”. That vision took some time to be realised though. The library got its start in 1837 as a humble school library, and over the next 188 years, it grew in size and scope. Today, the National Library and the National Archives help to make NLB one of Singapore’s key memory institutions.

To celebrate this milestone, do allow us to depart from our regular lineup of fascinating Singapore stories to tell you our stories (just as fascinating we hope). For this bumper issue of *BiblioAsia*, it is not possible to list all the articles in this note, but here are some highlights. I would suggest starting with the [history of the National Library](https://staging-lite.d3lqsdaf68v737.amplifyapp.com/vol-21/issue-2/jul-sep-2025/history-story-national-library-singapore/), which gives a quick, useful overview of the library’s development. Then there is the article on the [Singapore and Southeast Asia Collection](https://staging-lite.d3lqsdaf68v737.amplifyapp.com/vol-21/issue-2/jul-sep-2025/singapore-southeast-asia-collection/national-library/), which is the pride of the library. Nostalgia buffs will enjoy the photo essay revisiting the much-beloved [former National Library on Stamford Road](https://staging-lite.d3lqsdaf68v737.amplifyapp.com/vol-21/issue-2/jul-sep-2025/national-library-stamford-road-photos/) as well as the article on [part-time branch libraries](https://staging-lite.d3lqsdaf68v737.amplifyapp.com/vol-21/issue-2/jul-sep-2025/part-time-libraries/).



We also look at the National Archives, which originally began life as a department in the library. Two fascinating stories – on the [sound and audiovisual records](https://staging-lite.d3lqsdaf68v737.amplifyapp.com/vol-21/issue-2/jul-sep-2025/audio-visual-national-archives-singapore/), as well as the photo collections of [Studio De Luxe and Ronni Pinsler](https://staging-lite.d3lqsdaf68v737.amplifyapp.com/vol-21/issue-2/jul-sep-2025/ps-teo-ronni-pinsler/) – give a flavour of the vast treasure trove that resides in the archives.



This issue is not merely about the history of institutions though. It is also important to also remember the men and women whose contributions have left a mark. [Kung Tian Cheng](https://staging-lite.d3lqsdaf68v737.amplifyapp.com/vol-21/issue-2/jul-sep-2025/kung-tian-cheng-first-clerk-raffles-library/) rose to become First Clerk at the Raffles Library in the early 20th century. He helped compile a catalogue of the library’s holdings and, after leaving the library, lived a colourful life. He went to China where he became a journalist and also joined the library of Republic of China President Yuan Shikai.



Closer to the present day, we pay tribute to [Hedwig Anuar](https://staging-lite.d3lqsdaf68v737.amplifyapp.com/vol-21/issue-2/jul-sep-2025/hedwig-anuar-first-lady-of-the-national-library/), the first local director of the National Library. This larger-than-life woman was synonymous with the library, which is not surprising because she helmed it for more than two decades after Singapore’s independence. That article is accompanied by a personal essay penned by her daughter, Shirin Aroozoo, about what it was like growing up as [Hedwig Anuar’s daughter](https://staging-lite.d3lqsdaf68v737.amplifyapp.com/vol-21/issue-2/jul-sep-2025/mother-hedwig-anuar-shirin-aroozoo/).



This special edition is not just about looking back of course; it is also an opportunity to look ahead. In an age of ubiquitous information and generative AI, do libraries and librarians still have a future? In an interview, NLB Chief Executive Officer Ng Cher Pong sketches out how he thinks the [libraries and archives can remain relevant](https://staging-lite.d3lqsdaf68v737.amplifyapp.com/vol-21/issue-2/jul-sep-2025/toa-payoh-public-library/) in the face of these new challenges. We are certainly optimistic. We have been around for 188 years, and we plan on being around for another 188 more. Thank you for looking back and looking forward with us.
