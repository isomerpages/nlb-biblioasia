#### **Introduction**
Who were the so-called “lancing” girls1 of yesteryear? They were the
glamorous dance hostesses from the cabarets of the “big three” worlds of
entertainment in Singapore’s past – New World, Great World and Happy
World – who made a living from “lancing”, a Singlish mispronunciation
of “dancing”.1 This paper examines the way of life of these women in the
cabaret industry, with a focus on two of them who founded The Happy
School, a Chinese school that provided free education for street kids after
World War II . In a bid to regain their pride after having been being looked
down on for working in the cabaret, the “lancing girls” are shown here to
have contributed generously to charity. Speaking to four research subjects
in their 70s and 80s who had once been associated with the cabaret, we
trace the beginnings of Singapore’s nightclub dance scene, observe the rise
of pop music and the evolution of the *cheongsam* as a “lancing” dress. The
unadulterated accounts of the lives of these people offer a candid look at
Singapore’s unique history through the glitz (and sleaze) of the New, Great
and Happy Worlds.

#### **Background of the Cabaret World**
The New World Amusement Park was the first to open in 1923 at Jalan
Besar. Great World Amusement Park at Kim Seng Road opened next in 1931. 
Happy World, located between Mountbatten and Geylang roads, was
the last of the three to open, in 1936. Its name was changed to Gay World in
1964 when cinema operator Eng Wah took over the ownership.2

These parks were similar in their entertainment offerings, which included
shopping, film-going and dining. But what really drew the crowds were
the dance halls or cabarets. New World was famous for Bunga Tanjong,
a cabaret that hosted bands playing Malay tunes and *ronggeng* (a couple
dance likely to have originated from Java, also known as *joget*). Great World
attracted British servicemen and the middle class, with free films, Peking
operas as well as wrestling and boxing matches. Happy World was known
for its Sarong Kebaya Nights at the Happy Cabaret.3

During the war, all three worlds were converted into gambling farms. After
the end of the Japanese Occupation, western music could once again be
heard in Singapore. The cabarets resumed happy times, drawing young girls
into their dance halls to work and help their families put food on the table.
Single men, married men, couples and groups of people seeking after-dinner
entertainment all came trooping back. Bands comprised quartets, trios or a
hotchpotch of music lovers forming dance bands.

The repertoire of music ranged from Broadway to those by famous
composers such as Cole Porter and George Gershwin, to the music of the
swing era; anything that would draw in the masses – even local music
played by *keroncong* (an Indonesian musical style) bands – filled the air of
dance halls. Some of the more popular big bands included those led by
Cecil Wilson, Gerry Soliano, H.H. Tan and Peggy Tan, Sid Gomez and
Alfredo (Fred) Libio, who had his “all-star” Filipino Swing Band.4

#### **Working in the Cabaret in the 1940s and 50s**
So why were women drawn to work in the cabarets? Were they not afraid
that family and friends would frown upon their choice of work? My
search to speak to a former cabaret woman proved serendipitous when I
encountered a man operating the photocopier at one of the public libraries.
He was once a customer of the cabarets, and was still in touch with some
former cabaret women. When I told him I was working on a research paper
about them, he gave me the contact of Wong Siew Wah. The second woman
I met was Wong’s cousin, Ong Swee Neo.

Ong, 75, recalled: “It was 1952. I only studied until Standard 2. I was 12
years old when my mother brought me into the cabaret.” When probed,
Ong did not seem ashamed that she was 12 when she was brought into the
cabaret. “The money was good. My mother kept all my earnings. All I had
to do was sit, chat and dance. I was big-sized. No one could tell my real age.
Customers were kind. They never forced me to drink hard liquor. I would
only drink Green Spot or Red Lion orange crush.”5

Wong, 69, said, “My adoptive mother, Nancy Ho, worked as a ‘Mummy’ in
the cabaret. Her job was to look after the ‘lancing’ girls under her and make
sure that the clients did not try any funny business. These girls were also
known as taxi dancers or *mou luei* in Cantonese. What I remembered about
them was that they were tough women who had to adapt to hard times.”6

Further research into articles on the cabaret women made me realise that
life for the “lancing” girl wasn’t all hunky-dory. An average cabaret girl
could expect to earn about $200 a month, although the more popular girls
had been known to bring home $1,000 a month. In comparison, a senior
clerk working in the government in 1952 earned about $280 a month.7 For
just about anyone back then, earnings of $1,000 a month was a lot of money!

Cabaret girls were easily hired and fired. They had to be mindful of cabaret
etiquette and cultivate good customer relations. Discipline and patience
were vital for survival. Working from 6 pm to past midnight daily at the rate of one dance every three minutes, girls were expected to know their
music and dance steps. A quick change in tune meant slipping from the
foxtrot or quickstep into the *ronggeng* or *joget*. If hired to sit at a table for $13
an hour, the girl was expected to hold her liquor while drinking with four to
six customers. Girls professed to be able to throw up in 30-minute intervals,
and return to the table to keep on drinking. The worst bit of working in a
cabaret was when a jealous wife or girlfriend showed up to create trouble –
the toilet was the safest place to seek refuge.

In the first meeting of the Singapore Cabaret Girls’ Association held in
1939 at Great World, 180 members were warmly welcomed – the real
test, however, was realising “a potential membership of 500 girls”.8 The
early batch of *mou luei* (meaning dancing girl in Cantonese) hailed
from Shanghai and Hong Kong; they too had been members of similar
associations. What could a member expect from the Singapore Cabaret
Girls’ Association? Strength in numbers and, more importantly, a united
voice in fighting for the right to be treated with respect.

Exactly 10 years later, in 1949, membership figures at the Association stood
at 600. When I asked Wong what she recalled of her mother, she said, “She
was very active. She was always looking out for the girls.” As chairperson
of the association, Ho had fought for her girls to receive a tax deduction of
$125 a month “to keep up good appearances essential to their profession”.9
The amount represented about 15 percent of their total earnings. This was
unusual as the tax relief would have meant an official acceptance of the
Association’s recommendation that the girls’ “dresses, shoes, hair setting and
cosmetics” were an allowable deduction.

Following this, Ho successfully lobbied for the Association to change
their name to Singapore Dance Hostesses’ Association, which was a more
accurate reflection of what they did. In addition, she raised money for the
purchase and furnishing of a clubhouse at Lorong 10 Geylang, which cost
close to $15,000, for use by her dance hostesses.10

When I asked Ong if she missed the glitzy world of cabaret after her
fiancé forced her to leave, she said no, adding: “We were poor, I had little
education. My mother was also a cabaret girl, [and] it was the only job I
could do. Once I left, I never looked back.”

So what was life like for Nancy Ho and Ong Swee Neo after they left the
cabaret?

Ho found love and married a man she met at the cabaret; they adopted
three children, two girls and a boy. She also converted to Catholicism. Ong
married her sweetheart and had five children. Today, she is a grandmother
of 11.

#### **An Infamous Cabaret Girl Turned Striptease Dancer**

Many people I spoke to about cabaret life wanted to talk about the most
famous cabaret striptease dancer of the time, Rose Chan. And although
there was grudging respect for Chan’s daring to strip fully, the person
commenting would invariably call her an impolite term.

Chan had married at 16 to a much older man. After her marriage failed,
she turned to the cabaret for a job at Happy World. She taught herself to
dance and was a quick learner. She finished runner-up in the All-Women’s
Ballroom Dancing Championships in 1949 and was also runner-up in the
Miss Singapore Beauty Contest in 1950.11 Chan’s colourful life attracted
a great deal of attention in the 1950s. She was known as the “Queen of
Striptease” for her sensational acts, which included a circus stunt known as
the “Python Act” where she would wrestle with a python.

In August 2008, Singapore theatre group The Theatre Practice staged
*I am Queen*, a play that told the story of stripper Betty Yong, a character
modelled after Chan. A biopic of Chan’s life, titled *Chinese Rose*, was to have
been directed by Eric Khoo.12 Leading actress, Christy Yow, had been cast,
but for reasons unannounced, the project was called off by late 2009.

The third person I interviewed was Chan’s boyfriend, Edward Khoo, 85. He
had known Chan for five years in the 1950s. He wistfully recalled that Rose was a feisty character. She loved to dance, she loved music, and she never
backed down from a challenge. “She was very popular in the cabaret,” he said.
“I had heard about her, and I wanted to meet her. I finally got the chance.
After I got to know her well, I asked her to be my girlfriend. She agreed and
I put her up in a house in 40F Lorong Melayu at Sims Avenue East. But we
were never married as my parents objected to our relationship.”13

I spoke with Khoo for almost an hour and his face would light up each time
he mentioned the cabaret and his relationship with Chan.

#### **Cabaret Girls and Their Hearts of Gold**
Dancing was not all that the cabaret women did. Not many people are
aware that they were also involved in charity. In a report dated 27 August
1953 in *The Singapore Free Press*, an amount of $13,000 had been raised
by the Singapore Dance Hostesses’ Association in aid of the Nanyang
University building fund.14 The funds were raised through the staging
of several charity night performances. Rose Chan was part of the act
that raised this huge amount of money. Her generosity earned her the
nickname “Charity Queen”. She would donate to charities, including
those benefiting children, old folks’ homes, tuberculosis patients and
the blind.

But Chan wasn’t the only “Charity Queen” in the cabaret world. There were
also two other women who had piqued my interest: the founders of The
Happy School that once stood in Geylang, He Yan Na and Xu Qian Hong.

#### **The Happy School**
In 1946, local cabaret girls from Happy World in Geylang answered the
call from one of their “big sisters”, He Yan Na, to donate money to set
up a Chinese-medium school. He, the chairperson of the Happy World
Dance Troupe (which later became Happy Opera Society), had been
deeply troubled by the large number of idle children roaming the streets of
Geylang. These were the unfortunate children who had had their education
interrupted by the war.

He roped in her fellow dance hostesses to set up the school. She became the
chairperson of the school’s board of governors, and another dancer, Xu Qian
Hong, was recruited to be the accounts head. Other girls from the Happy
Opera Society became board members.

Determined that the children should receive a free education, He insisted
that no school fees would be collected from the families. Whatever books
and stationery the children needed would be provided free. The first
enrolment in 1946 attracted about 90 students. Operating out of a rented
shophouse at Lorong 14, He named the school “Happy Charity School” in
an obvious nod to the most popular landmark in Geylang then – the Happy
World amusement park.15

The first principal of the school was Wong Guo Liang, a well-known
calligrapher. When Wong first met He at the interview for the position, he
related how he had been struck by her charisma and generosity. She in turn
advised him that as a principal, he had to set a good example and live up
to the responsibility of being a role model for his charges and should never
visit the Happy World Cabaret. He also related how her impoverished past,
which led to her missing out on an education, made her determined to help
the children. Education would give the children the means to do something
worthy with their lives.16

Giving insight into how He viewed her position as a cabaret dancer, she
frankly shared her frustration that “the profession of dancing girls is seen
as inferior. If society can abandon its prejudice and be rational, they would
understand that they have misunderstood the art of dancing. They are being
cruel to cabaret girls due to their ignorance. If dancing is corrupt, then this
negative image comes not from the dancers, but the vice that tarnishes the
environment. To punish and shame the girls is ridiculous.”17

The co-founder of Happy Charity School, Xu Qian Hong, was a great
beauty with a generous heart. An article in the *Nanyang Siang Pau* dated
10 June 1947 described her as “enchanting” and “energetic” by turns. A
Cantonese, Xu became a cabaret girl at 16 to help her father support her younger siblings after the death of her mother. She only had two years of
Chinese education at the time. A widely sought-after cabaret girl, Xu earned
about $1,000 a month; from out of her own pocket, she would donate about
$500 each month to help the school defray its expenses.18

What the two women and their comrades did was admirable in the context
of the urgent need to keep children off the streets. An article in *The Straits
Times* dated 23 November 1947 declared that “Singapore Needs More
Schools”. The number of children in need of schooling had increased because
of the interruption of the Japanese Occupation. There were approximately
90,000 children of school-going age.19 The situation was made worse by the
fact that there were not enough teachers, and a shortage of books. During
the Japanese Occupation, the Japanese had targeted the Chinese for the
most severe and cruel treatment. Anti-Japanese imperialist campaigns led
by the Chinese community and Chinese schools in Malaya throughout
the occupation had ensured their persecution. Chinese schoolteachers
were systematically targeted during the Sook Ching (“ethnic cleansing”)
massacre, with many taken away and killed. Chinese books were also not
spared. An estimated 200,000 books were destroyed by the Japanese during
this period.20

In the face of this dire situation, He and Xu became actively involved in the
running of the school from 1946 to 1950. With increasing challenges such as
rising costs and the need to recruit more teachers, the school implemented a
school fee of between $2.50 and $3.50 per student in January 1950. Following
this, the Happy Charity School relinquished its “free” status and renamed
itself The Happy School.21

For unknown reasons, the two women left the school after this period.
Their whereabouts were untraceable, although a search in the Chinese press
revealed a controversial court case that involved Xu, over the purchase of a female child whom she had wanted to adopt.22 In my interview with former
cabaret girl Ong Swee Neo, I learnt that there had been a general acceptance
back in the day for unmarried cabaret women to adopt young female
children to be groomed as cabaret girls. I assumed that these girls would
then be expected to take care of their adoptive mothers after their retirement
from the cabaret world.

The Happy School operated out of Geylang from 1946 to 1979. It moved once
in 1947, from Unit 24 on Lorong 14 to Units 67 and 69 along the same lane,
after receiving financial help from George Lee, the owner of Happy World.

In 1946, The Happy School started with 90 students. By 1959, its enrolment
had ballooned to about 600 students. Due to insufficient space at its
Geylang premises, some lessons had to be conducted out of two rented
classrooms at the Mountbatten Community Centre.23

Unfortunately, in the 1960s and 1970s, the school experienced a similar
trend seen across all Chinese-medium schools in Singapore. As Singapore’s
economy shifted towards industrialisation and English became recognised
as the de facto working language, more and more parents decided to send
their children to English-stream schools. Dwindling student numbers at
Chinese-medium schools islandwide eventually sounded the death knell for
The Happy School.

In 1979, the school announced its closure. By that time, The Happy School
had amassed $400,000 in savings, which it donated to 10 Chinese schools
and grassroots organisations.24 After 33 years, The Happy School closed a
chapter in the history of free schools for children in Singapore. Without a
doubt, its inception was graced with a touch of glamour (and controversy)
by cabaret women. Yet, were it not for the founders He and Xu, many of
these destitute children would not have had a primary school education in
post-war Singapore.

#### **Further Research into the Lives of Cabaret Girls**
Being a cabaret woman back in the day came with some form of social
stigma attached. In three letters that I came across, addressed to the
Chinese news daily *Nanyang Siang Pau* in 1937, 1938 and 1976, the writers,
all cabaret women, shared candid reflections of their lives. The first letter in
1937 sought to paint an accurate picture of cabaret girls, placing them into
two categories. The first comprised girls with mediocre dancing abilities
but who were able to engage customers easily because of their looks and
feminine wiles. These girls were very popular with older, rich men who
were liberal with their wallets. The second category of girls were excellent
dancers. Though not very pretty, they prided themselves on doing their jobs
professionally, which meant dancing and giving their customers an enjoyable
time. These girls usually drew younger men, mostly students.25

The 1938 letter lamented the working conditions of cabaret women:
long working hours in close confines with large crowds, and being often
“manhandled” by customers. The women would fall sick easily, contracting
illnesses such as typhoid fever (characterised by fever, diarrhoea, headaches
and intestinal inflammation). When admitted to the hospital, they could
only stay in third-class wards, the cheapest form of medical care available,
as the dance halls that employed these girls made no provision to help
them financially.26

The 1976 letter shared a brutally honest account of cabaret life: beneath
all the glitz and attraction of the cabaret, life was tough. To survive, the
women had to be extremely wary of their customers. These men could
be businessmen or secret society members, and offending the wrong men
would mean trouble. To stay popular, girls were expected to be welldressed
and to look beautiful. They had to have a demure disposition and
be accommodating and caring. Girls had to learn to be subservient to the
needs of the customer; it would help if they were eloquent or were adept
at socialising. When it came to money or gifts, the writers claimed that
very few girls would be able to reject them. Some girls became mistresses
(kept women) of their customers. This was something affirmed by Rose Chan’s then-boyfriend, Khoo, during my interview with him. The letter
ended with the remark that “the ugly profession of the cabaret girls is an
open secret; *mai yin* (卖淫) [to prostitute oneself for money] is a commonly
accepted practice”.27

So if working in the cabaret subjected women to prejudice and numerous
“sacrifices”, why did they take on such jobs? To answer this question, let’s
take a look at the jobs that were available for women back in the 1940s.

#### **The Lot of Women in the Past**
In 1948 when the National Registration Ordinance was passed, the National
Registration Office (NRO ) of the colonial government began issuing paper
ICs (identity cards) to identify individuals born in Singapore. Women
signed up as clerks to help with the registration process. At a rate of $6 a
day, they reported for work in the writing section of the NRO Headquarters
at Beach Road, filling out particulars of individuals to process their new
ICs. In an article published in *The Straits Times* on 30 October 1948, it was
stated that up to 300 women were on the payroll to perform these tasks.
Work started at 8am and went on until 5pm, with 15-minute breaks every
two hours to provide relief. A large proportion of the 112 female clerks doing
this registration job were cabaret girls who needed a day job to supplement
their earnings from the cabaret.28 Besides the cabaret girls, there were also
European and Eurasian housewives, as well as girls who had just left school.
Filling out 160 cards a day, the girls knew that it was only a temporary job
that would end once the NRO achieved its target to issue all ICs. What else
could women do then?

There were alternative jobs, such as working as barbers. In a *Straits Times*
article dated 23 October 1949, titled “Kindest Cut by Women Barbers”, an
estimated one-third of about 2,000 Chinese barbers were young women. But
the job of a barber was not easy. An hour’s schedule of service involved hair
clipping, shaving, shampooing and ear cleaning. Tending to an average of 50
heads a day, the female barber had to be on her feet for 15 hours daily. They
would only get to keep 70 percent of their takings if they lived on their own; if they were boarding with their salon proprietors, they would only get to
keep 50 percent, with the balance used to pay for food and material costs.29

The average salary for a female barber was about $100 a month, a pittance
compared to working in the cabaret. From 1955 to 1959, other jobs that
were available to women included working as seamstresses, sales assistants,
tour guides, singers in the dance halls and restaurant waitresses. If a girl
was educated, she could consider becoming an office secretary or a private
tutor. Objectively, these jobs did not pay as well as that of a cabaret dance
girl. So if a woman needed cash urgently, cabaret dancing provided a
means to quick and good money.

Most of the cabaret girls probably thought they could take care of
themselves. But Khoo and Wong shared that it was easy to be led astray;
they knew of cabaret girls who had become pregnant on the job. But
because they wanted to keep on dancing, they risked their lives when they
chose to undergo abortions. In an abortion, complications could arise,
such as getting lacerations in the womb or being left with an incomplete,
septic abortion that could lead to severe infection. There were legalised
clinics to turn to, such as the “well-known” clinic in Geylang managed
by a Dr Harold Chan who was quoted as one that women turned to. But
sometimes, these girls turned to cheaper alternatives to terminate their
pregnancies, such as unlicensed medical workers or private midwives, which
sometimes led to disastrous consequences.

Of course, it is not fair to generalise all cabaret women as “unchaste”, for
want of a better word. But the negative perception towards these women
was something difficult to shake off, as seen from this former cabaret
customer’s experience:

   *Happy World Cabaret was the most popular one among the<br>
   three amusement parks. The cabaret girls would live near their<br>
   workplace, so for those working in Happy World, they would live<br>
   in Geylang. I would visit the cabaret five, or up to six, times a<br>
   week. I was working as an engineer in the late 1930s; I had a car,<br>
   so I could drive my friends around. Most of the customers attracted<br>
   to Happy World were the Europeans. The band was really good,<br>
   a Filipino one*.<br><br>

   *When the Navy officers from America and Britain were on shore<br>
   leave and came to visit the cabarets, fights would break out,<br>
   usually over the choice of dance partners. One of the regulations<br>
   of the cabaret was that a girl could not refuse a dance. She could<br>
   complain if the customer was abusive or difficult, but she couldn’t<br>
   say no. These girls were allowed to be booked out when “Mummies”<br>
   came into the picture. They controlled these girls, where they lived,<br>
   what they ate, et cetera*.<br><br>

   *When the “Mummies” said the girls could leave the cabaret,<br>
   usually near closing time, the girls would be booked out an hour<br>
   before they left the cabaret, and this was when prostitution started.<br>
   These “Mummies” would take a cut from the booking ($2 out of<br>
   $12 an hour, this was the rate after the war). The standard of the<br>
   cabaret dropped when [the] more respectable girls left the cabaret<br>
   because of this*.30
	 

If the cabaret girls were expecting, they would find it hard to continue
working, so they would usually choose to terminate the pregnancy. In
the 3 November 1962 *The Straits Times* article “Victim of An Abortionist
Takes Secret to the Grave”, it was apparent that there was a veil of secrecy
surrounding the subject of abortions, even to the extent of shielding the
identities of medical workers who conducted such procedures on the sly. In
this case, a 34-year old bar waitress, Gertrude June Pinto, refused to reveal
the name of the medical worker who had operated on her. Complications
from the botched operation led to tetanus, which eventually took her life.
This was not Pinto’s first operation by the same man, and it was revealed
that the clandestine operation had been performed in the “staff quarters” of
the General Hospital at New Bridge Road.31

Another article in *The Straits Times*, “Bar Girl Tells of An Abortionist, Then
Dies”, dated 21 December 1962, reported that 21-year-old Lim Ai Choo went
to a woman who ran a private maternity service in a garment shop at North
Bridge Road. Lim paid $100 for the abortion, and was rushed to Kandang Kerbau Maternity Hospital when problems arose. Despite an emergency
operation to save her, she died.32

Besides losing their moral compasses, the cabaret girls were also subjected
to another harsh reality of the job – losing their appeal to customers as
they advanced in age. On 5 October 1972, the *New Nation* ran a four-part
report, headlined “Glamour Only a Façade”, on the lives of cabaret girls,
stating that “age is a hard fact of a cabaret girl’s life. The older she gets, the
less marketable she is. The old and unsuccessful usually turn to full-time
prostitution. Only about 5 percent marry and settle down to security and a
home of their own.”33

#### **The Glamour of a “Lancing Girl”**

Much has been said about the tough life of a cabaret girl. On a lighter
note, let us look at the glitz associated with the cabaret. In particular, I was
interested in seeing how cabaret girls dressed from the late 1920s to 1960s.
Looking good and being well-groomed for the job meant spending on
clothes, hair and cosmetics. Advertisements and pictures from newspapers
provide a peek into the fashion of these cabaret girls.

<img src="/images/COA%202014%20to%202016/Lancing%20Girls/A_New_World_Cabaret_1.jpg" style="width:80%;">

Like most women in Singapore, cabaret girls were probably influenced by
fashion trends featured in entertainment magazines. They naturally looked
towards Shanghai and Hong Kong for inspiration, as these cities were
acknowledged as the leading fashion capitals of the time.

What did Chinese women wear back in the 1920s? The *samfoo* (or *samfu*)
was the preferred casual attire, comprising a short-sleeved cotton blouse
with a Mandarin collar and frog-buttons, with a matching pair of trousers
in the same material, which was usually pastel, printed cotton. By the
1930s, women in the upper social classes had turned to the *cheongsam*, or
*qipao* in Mandarin, as their preferred dress. This trend soon cut across all
sectors, with the *cheongsam* being worn as a symbol of strong feminine
expression. After World War II , more women turned to wearing western
clothes, but there were those who remained faithful to the traditional *cheongsam*, preferring its tighter fit. But due to influences from the west,
the cheongsam was embellished and accessorised in line with European and
American trends.34

For Straits Chinese (Peranakan) women, or *nonyas*, the *sarong kebaya*
became increasingly reserved only for special occasions, such as weddings.
However, older Peranakan women still wore the outfit on a daily basis,
throughout the 1950s up until the late 20th century.35

With the influx of Cantonese and Shanghainese tailors who set up shop
along Orchard Road, High Street, North Bridge Road, Bras Basah Road and
Bukit Timah, women who chose to wear *cheongsams* were offered top-class
workmanship as well as a wide range of fabrics in *cheongsam* tailoring. There
were also smaller tailor shops that catered to women with more modest means.

Johnny Chia, in his 60s, a former singer at the Happy World Cabaret whom
I interviewed, recalled the cabaret women he had known and respected:
“They were so beautiful in their *cheongsams*! Many of them were natural
beauties with very little makeup. They loved music and they loved dancing.
It doesn’t matter what I was singing, whether it was Western, Cantonese or
Baba Malay songs, they would know the steps.”

hostesses taken inside a cabaret in

their legs.<i> Courtesy

In the 1950s, when Singapore was a regional distribution centre for textiles
because of its entrepôt trade and free port status, women were able to buy
the trendiest fabrics for their *cheongsams*, which were also made affordable
with the introduction of synthetic textiles. Artificial fabrics were popular
because they were easy to wear and maintain. Durable, lightweight and not
easily creased, they made *cheongsam*-wearing hassle-free for the working
cabaret girl.36

By the 1960s, there emerged the concept of a “national dress” that appeared
on fashion models in advertisements. In Malaysia, women were encouraged
to wear the modern *sarong kebaya*, often together with other models in
*cheongsam* and *sari*, as an expression of multiracial harmony. Chinese
women would wear the *cheongsam*, and Indian women would wear the *sari*. Fashionable pairings, such as wearing a *sarong* and *kebaya* made of the
same *batik* fabric, emerged around this period and inspired the uniform for
Malaysia-Singapore Airlines. *Batik* was also adapted for swimwear, westernstyle
dresses, and of course, the ubiquitous *cheongsam*.37

Fashion aside, Singapore’s music scene, too, could claim to have been
influenced by the cabarets. From the 1920s to the 1940s, music in churches
and at the cinemas provided artistic enjoyment, but the venues of Singapore’s
mass entertainment facilities, the dance halls, also provided a platform for the
growth of music appreciation. The cabarets played a special role in hosting
foreign bands set up along the lines of the European big bands. The audiences
were able to listen to a properly constituted dance orchestra. Comprising three
sections, with saxophones, trumpets and trombones, and rhythm provided
by the pianos, drums, guitars and double bass, cabaret dance orchestras were
no different from European or American swing bands, which were then all
the rage. Popular music from the films of those days was standard fare for the
bands and they made up “combos” of various descriptions.

The three entertainment Worlds, with their multifarious attractions,
restaurants, jugglers, magicians, *wayang* and sporting events, were ideal
places for family outings. The dance halls, with their soothing sounds of
mellifluous saxes, complemented by the steady rhythms of a slow foxtrot or
waltz, could have been the scenes of seduction where many men fell in love
with dance music and the cabaret girls.38

#### **Bunga Tanjong and the Perempuan Joget**
When examining the influences of the cabaret, I came across a play that
was inspired by a well-known cabaret in the Malay-speaking world.
Originally titled *Lantai T. Pinkie*, the play was written by A. Samad Said,
a Malaysian playwright and author. The Institut Terjemahan Negara
Malaysia Berhad republished the play as a book in 2010, with permission
from Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka, Malaysia, using their translated work
published in 2003.

*T. Pinkie’s Floor* was first performed by Teater Kami from 5 to 6 June 1996
at the World Trade Centre Auditorium, Singapore, as part of the Singapore
Arts Festival.

A. Samad Said revealed in an interview that he had written the play based
on his memories of the early 1950s and 1960s, when he used to frequent
New World. He identified himself as one of the gangsters who kept watch
over his “base” around Maude, Syed Alwi, Owen, Kerbau and Hindoo
roads, noting that the area was “a busy world unto itself with hotels and the
entertainment district, and there were gangsters all over!”39

This is the missing element in descriptions of the cabaret world: one of
danger, where secret societies cast their long shadows over the cabaret girls.
In the words of A. Samad Said, gang members “struck terror and [were]
greatly feared”.

The cabaret referred to in the area was none other than Bunga Tanjong. A gang
that was mentioned was the “Gang Jambatan Merah” (Red Bridge Gang),
which operated around the Newton area. A. Samad Said worked for this gang
and was tasked to collect “protection money” from the *joget* dancers under his
watch. He described this world as one where “there were always fights, between
gangs, between the police and the army”. A. Samad Said also added that “if a
fight broke out, the police would arrive in their lorry”.40

A. Samad Said described writing *T. Pinkie’s Floor* as a “document of an era,
a decade, a way of life that when it’s no longer there, it becomes important.
You take all those stories, they all happened around me, and they become a
documentary about an era”.41

The play traces a series of flashbacks unveiled by former accordion player
Muhairi Tirus to a young man named Loiran Sindu, who was piecing
together the story of a lost world that his mother had shared before she
died. This lost world comprised the lives of several *perempuan joget*(female
dancers) of a “dance floor” (hence the title of the play). T. Pinkie was later
revealed to be Loiran’s grandmother, told through a sad account of how she
had been raped and held captive by a gangster head.

In a wistful sharing of how A. Samad Said arrived at the name of “Pinkie”
for the protagonist, he described her as the “most beautiful woman” in the
*joget* world. “Her beauty is represented by her pink *baju* (blouse). Pinkie
epitomises all the desires, the impossibilities, the love and the brawls of men
who want her. Men went to the* joget* world to possess her. If they could,
they would buy 12 or 20 tickets and they would want to give all of them to
Pinkie so that they would be the only one to dance the night away with her.
They would want to have sole monopoly over Pinkie and this was the source
of all the fights and brawls. Pinkie of New World was an amalgamation of
many beautiful women of the *joget* world.”42

#### **The “Singaporeanness” of the Cabaret**
In 1988, as part of the Singapore Arts Festival, four young men got together
for the first time to write, produce, cast and direct Singapore’s first English
musical, *Beauty World*. Writer Michael Chiang, 33, songwriter Dick Lee, 31,
choreographer Mohd Najip Ali, 23, and director Ong Keng Sen, 24, would
later go on to headline the local creative arts scene for several decades. The
cast also featured a stellar line-up of actors, with Claire Wong, Ivan Heng
and Jacinta Abisheganaden, who would all become familiar names in
Singapore’s playwriting and acting community.

Set in the 1960s, the story is about a small-town Malaysian girl from
Batu Pahat, Ivy Chan Poh Choo, who travels to Singapore to uncover
the mystery of her parentage. Her only clue to finding her father is a jade
locket inscribed with the words “Beauty World”, which leads her to join the
seedy cabaret where most of the action unfolds. Within the complex world
of caterwauling cabaret girls and lecherous men, Ivy has to keep her head
above water and still remain true to her boyfriend, Frankie.

The inspiration for the musical was drawn from the cabaret world of the
1960s, replete with music and lyrics reminiscent of the *cha-cha-cha* dance
era. In the style of Broadway, *Beauty World*’s tunes were catchy, although
some criticised that the songwriter had written 1980s contemporary pop
music for a 1960s world.43

When asked why the story was set in a cabaret, Chiang shared that it was
“something nostalgic that was also unique to Singapore”. In a commentary
made in *Private Parts &amp; Other Play Things: A Collection of Popular Singapore
Comedies* by *Michael Chiang*, Ong Keng Sen said that “the performance of
Michael’s plays are charged with a raw community energy and pride which
reverberates in the theatre. His work crosses language and racial boundaries
by celebrating our ‘Singaporeanness’ rather than by dividing us.”44

Echoing the sentiments of this statement, I would say how true it is that
the cabaret is a celebration of a slice of our unique history; its indelible
“Singaporeanness” is affirmed by the attitudes of the people I interviewed
for this paper. Every one of them spoke of the past with whimsical
longing, and even if their lives had been scarred by pain and struggle,
they shared their stories with the quiet pride of having experienced life in
the cabaret.

For Wong Siew Wah, Ong Swee Neo, Edward Khoo and Johnny Chia, I
have no doubt that if any of them were given a chance to relive their pasts
all over again, they would not change a single thing.
