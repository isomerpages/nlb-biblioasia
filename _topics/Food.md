Set up by five Buddhist women in 1946, Loke Woh Yuen was the first&nbsp;[Chinese vegetarian restaurant](https://biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg/vol-18/issue-2/jul-sep-2022/buddhist-women-vegetarian-food-singapore/)&nbsp;in Singapore. It employed an all-female staff, was known for its popular shark’s fin made from maize, and was sometimes so packed that it had to set up dining tents that stretched to the main road. Its efforts to spread vegetarianism were complemented by other Buddhist women and nuns who wrote cookbooks and fundraised for charity.

A tireless steward of Malay culture, Hajah Asfiah worked all her life to preserve and pass on Malay crafts. When she was just 10, she began teaching embroidery and flower arrangement in school. Later in life, she was a&nbsp;_mak andam_&nbsp;(wedding attendant) for more than 20 years and worked with more than 1,000 brides. At age 65, she got her cookbook&nbsp;_Hidangan Warisan Kita_&nbsp;(Our Heritage Dishes; 1986) published by Times Books International; it was the publisher’s first cookbook, written in Malay by a Malay person. The book had recipes for dishes that have since become extinct. Sadly, she died a year later, but thanks to the book she wrote and the many courses she taught, her memory lives on.
