#### **Building Bridges of Mutual Understanding**
Reading clubs serve a vital purpose: building bridges of understanding through literature. The power of literature stems from authors creating diverse characters within narrative frameworks, enabling these voices to explore complex issues from multiple perspectives. When we read these stories, we can step outside our own beliefs and listen to these varied voices, developing empathy for characters whose experiences may be very different from our own. It was with this intent that "The World is Turbulent, We Read" Reading Club was formed online during the pandemic. By bringing together authors and readers from different locations, the club encouraged participants to set aside their prejudices, engage deeply with the stories, and build emotional connections that led to greater understanding of each other.

#### **Creating Shared Memories**
The greatest reward of participating in reading clubs lies not in reading itself, but in creating shared memories and exchanging ideas with fellow readers. What makes the experience particularly special is the occasional opportunity to engage directly with authors and witness their genuine passion firsthand. Our reading club has become something of a spiritual sanctuary. It offers more than just encouragement and motivation to read together; through our interactions with books and each other, we create a unique world that exists within literature and brings together people from different places.

#### **Looking to the Future**
"The World is Turbulent, We Read" Reading Club is now in its fifth year, and we still believe in our founding philosophy: reading should bring people together, transcending borders and languages. We examine texts closely, and we turn our discussions into real action, using literature to better understand and engage with the world around us.
