#### **Lee Geok Boi** looks at what makes Peranakan cuisine unique and delves into old cookbooks to see how Straits-born cuisine came to be. 

Bakwan kepiting. Babi pongteh. Ayam buah keluak. Many Singaporeans would describe these dishes as classic Peranakan or Straits Chinese dishes. However, the Malay word “peranakan” means “local born”, so perhaps a more accurate term for this cuisine is not so much “Straits Chinese” but “Straits-born”. 

The Straits, in this case, refers not only to the territories of the former Straits Settlements, namely Singapore, Melaka and Penang, but also the islands that make up the Indonesian archipelago – an area that historians refer to as Island Southeast Asia. Through centuries of trade and colonisation, the people of Island Southeast Asia melded ancient culinary traditions with colonial culinary cultures and introduced ingredients that gave rise to several hybrid cuisines characteristic of the Straits-born communities – Eurasian (mainly of Portuguese, Dutch and English heritage),1 Chetti Melaka (or Chitty Melaka)2 as well as Penang, Melaka and Indonesian Chinese. 

In Straits-born kitchens, housewives and servants whipped up meals that were rooted in the geography, history and traditional ingredients of Island Southeast Asia. These resulted in a fusion cuisine that we enjoy and are familiar with today.

#####**The Rich Flavours of 
Straits-born Cuisine**

What makes a cuisine Straits-born? Well, it would feature dishes that are an amalgamation of Indian, Chinese and European influences infused with traditional Malay-Indonesian and Southeast Asian cooking. The latter two cuisines evolved from what indigenous cooks first found in the wild and began cultivating in kitchen gardens, along with ingredients sourced from village markets. 

Numerous aromatics such as lemongrass (Cymbopogon) or serai in Malay, and galangal (Alpinia galanga) or greater galangal, also known as lengkuas or blue ginger, are native to Southeast Asia. Several types of ginger such as the common ginger (Zingiber officinale) can be found across Asia – from South Asia through Southeast Asia to East Asia. Locally available plants that yield fragrant leaves used in Straits cooking include those from the kaffir lime or limau perut in Malay (Citrus hystrix), also known as the makrut lime, and the pandan (Pandanus amaryllifolius) or screwpine. 

Certain local flowers are also used in Southeast Asian cooking. The blue pea flower or butterfly pea flower (Clitoria ternatea), known in Malay as bunga telang, is favoured as a natural food colouring in otherwise boring, white glutinous rice desserts while the superb fragrance of the torch ginger bud (Etlingera elatior), or bunga kantan, adds flavour to salads and curries. 

As its scientific name suggests, the blue pea flower originally came from Ternate, one of the fabled Spice Islands of the Moluccas (now Maluku Islands). The Spice Islands are the original source of the world’s nutmeg (Myristica fragrans), candlenut or buah keras (Aleurites moluccana), and clove (Syzygium aromaticum).

In addition to aromatics, various useful plants that yield valuable cooking ingredients can also be found in this region. They include palms such as the coconut palm (Cocos nucifera) and sago palm (Metroxylon sagu). 

East Java is the main source of buah keluak, the hard nut of the kepayang (Pangium edule), a tropical tree native to Indonesia, Malaysia and New Guinea. As hydrogen cyanide, a poison, is found in all parts of the tree, the nuts have to undergo a complicated process to neutralise the poison before they can be sold. Aficionados of buah keluak then go through another process to thoroughly clean and shell the nuts before cooking them with chicken or pork in this unusual-looking dish. 

Global trade and the movement of traders added yet more ingredients to an already well-endowed Southeast Asian culinary tradition.3 Pepper (Piper nigrum), originally native to India, has been cultivated in Java and Sumatra since 200 BCE. Turmeric (Curcuma longa) and cardamom (Elettaria cardamomum), two members of the ginger family, are native to India, as are tamarind (Tamarindus indica), or asam, and the mango (Mangifera indica). 

The Indian traders who introduced Buddhism and Hinduism to Southeast Asia also brought with them seed spices that they had acquired through trade further westwards: coriander (Coriandrum sativum) from the southern Mediterranean, cumin (Cuminum cyminum) from West Asia, fennel (Foeniculum vulgare) from southern Europe and West Asia, and fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum) from southern Europe and West Asia. These spices became essentials in the spice mixes used in Indian and Straits-born cuisines. 

There is also Chinese influence in Southeast Asian cooking. Chinese traders, notably Hokkiens from Fujian province, began arriving in Southeast Asia as early as the 10th century. The Hokkiens describe Fujian as “eight parts mountains, one part water and one-part farmland”.4 They naturally turned to the sea to improve their economic lot and formed trading hubs in Southeast Asian port cities along the maritime Silk Road, stretching from southern China past the waters of Island Southeast Asia westwards to South and West Asia. 

One such hub in 15th-century Melaka evolved into the Baba Malay-speaking Straits Chinese (Baba Malay being a creole language combining Malay and Hokkien) as well as giving rise to the Chetti Melaka. The Straits Chinese hub in Penang, which was founded as a British trading port in 1786, remained primarily Hokkien-speaking. These accidental settlers brought with them traditional Chinese condiments such as soya sauce (made from fermented soya beans) and other soya products. Originally from Southeast Asia, soya beans were domesticated in China as early as 1100 BCE.5

It is believed that the Chinese introduced fermentation technology to the region. However, the inhabitants of ancient Island Southeast Asia probably already knew much about fermented foods. These include belacan (fermented krill paste) and chinchalok (fermented krill), traditional foods that are popular regionally. Ancient Javanese records list some of the food and drinks once consumed in the 10th century such as fermented rice (tapeh) and fermented drinks like palm wine or toddy.6  

The sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) made its way to Indonesia and India perhaps as early as 8000 BCE. But what we call sugar today only became common from the 16th century onwards after sugar plantations using African slave labour in the West Indies produced sugar in quantities large enough to meet popular demand in Europe.7 Southeast Asian desserts were, and still are, sweetened with palm sugar, of which gula melaka (known as gula jawa in Indonesia) is just one kind. Different kinds of palms yield sweeteners in various hues and with different fragrances.  

The arrival of the Portuguese in the 16th century brought about one of the biggest changes to the flavour profile of South Asian and Southeast Asian cooking. This was the introduction of the chilli (Capsicum frutescens) to Goa and Melaka following their colonisation by the Portuguese in 1510 and 1511 respectively. Chilli plants were originally native to Mexico and Central America and the word “chilli” means “hot pepper” in Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs. 

The subsequent arrival of the Dutch and British brought wheat flour and butter, without which Straits-born classics such as sugee cake and kueh lapis8 (also known as spekkoek, meaning “bacon cake” in Dutch) would not be possible. Traditional Southeast Asian kueh (or kuih; bite-sized snacks or dessert foods) were rice-based.
