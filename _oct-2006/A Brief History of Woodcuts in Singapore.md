description: "In 1966, six local woodcut artists held their first group show at
  the National Library on Stamford Road. In 2006, works by the same artists take
  centre stage in an anniversary exhibition at the National Library Building on
  Victoria Street. This introduces the art of woodcut printmaking, and its
  history and practice as an art form in Singapore. "
