***…The ceremonies you have seen today are ancient, and some of their origins are veiled in the mists of the past. But their spirit and their meaning shine through the ages never, perhaps, more brightly than now...***

Most people love parades for they are festive and escapist; day-to-day tasks take a standstill as people congregate at common venues to treat themselves to a spectacle of precision, colours loud music and fireworks. Parades are timeless symbols of unity as they transcend ethnicity and age, and showcase icons of progress that everyone can identify and be proud of.

On 9 August every year, Singaporeans look forward to the National Day Parade (NDP) to celebrate their independence. Military drills, band performances, fly- and march-pasts and fireworks never fail to excite us. As Singapore prepares for her 41st NDP on 9 August 2006, we reminisce the country’s commitment to this pageantry to commemorate the occasion through the *Singapore on Parade* online exhibition. This exhibition aims to recapture the fine moments and grandeur of the grand parades in Singapore from colonial to modern times. The ceremonies in pre-independence parades were of British conception and carried messages of British empire-building. But traditions die hard and many of the parade rituals seen then have continued into present day NDPs. The main difference lies in the spirit and meaning; while pre-independence parades rejoiced at Singapore’s patronage to the greatest empire on earth, NDPs celebrate Singapore’s triumph as a nation united by the country’s own defined ideals of progress.
