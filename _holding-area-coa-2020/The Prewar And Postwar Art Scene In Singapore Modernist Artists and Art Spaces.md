#### **Introduction**
In September 1935, a group of immigrant Chinese artists established the
Society of Chinese Artists (SOCA; 中華美術研究會), or Société des artistes
Chinois, in Singapore. These Modernist artists were distinct from the
preceding generation of artists, who were mostly born in the 19th century
and schooled in the classics under the tutelage of traditional scholars, and
whose works were produced in the traditional mode.

In this paper, I examine the prewar and postwar (late 1920s–early 1950s) art
scene in Singapore: the life and work of the active but lesser-known SOCA
Modernist founders, the relationships among them, the prevalent styles of
their work, the historical and social circumstances that shaped their art, and
the art spaces they used. Although these artists are neither well documented
nor canonised, they were part of the vibrant prewar and postwar art scene.
My study reveals a microcosm of artistic germination and rich human
dynamics in the prewar and postwar art scene and fills the gaps in our
knowledge of early Singapore art history.

The art scene from the turn of the 20th century up to the eve of Singapore’s
independence has been analysed by Yeo Mang Thong as consisting of four
strands of development:1

  1.  the period between the late 19th and early 20th centuries, centring<br> 
    around individuals of cultural influence, such as Khoo Seok Wan, his<br> 
    literary circle and the sojourning scholars who offered their literati<br> 
    skills (calligraphy and painting) to the Chinese mercantile community;

  2. the period corresponding to the Chinese Republican years, which saw<br> 
    the rise of graphic art (woodcut prints and cartoons) as a new form of<br> 
    social expression, and a group of Modernist artists in exile from China,<br> 
    mostly members of SOCA;

  3. Singapore under the Japanese Occupation (1942–45); and

  4. unique artistic personalities, namely Tchang Ju-ch’i, Situ Qiao, both<br>
    prominent patriotic artists of the prewar period, and Austrian sculptor<br>
    Karl Duldig, who lived and worked in Singapore in 1939–40.

The present study focuses on the second strand of development, drawing on
a wide range of materials, including public and private archives, newspapers,
school yearbooks, clan association annuals, business directories, magazines,
periodicals and literary publications. With secondary research, I pieced these
fragments of information together, to create a more comprehensive and
historically framed network of human relations, and reconstruct Singapore’s
early art history.

#### **The Founders of the Society of Chinese Artists**

A group photograph (Figure 1) of SOCA’s founding members around
September or October 1935, shortly after the society had been registered and
their first meeting held, marks the beginning of this investigative journey.
According to the photo’s caption, the artists pictured are as follows: (from
right to left) Lee Kueh Sei, Tchang Ju-ch’i, Shu Chun Lien, Lu Heng,
Zhang Bohe, Lin Dao’an, Chen Chong Swee, Cai Zhuzhen, Nai Wen Chie,
Dai Yinlang, Chang Ming Tzu, Mrs Chang Ming Tzu, Chen Pu Chie, Kau
Chin Sheng and U-Chow.

SOCA was originally a smaller gathering of alumni from art schools in
Shanghai2 called the Syrens Art Association. They must have realised,
however, that limiting membership to Shanghai alumni was denying them
the critical mass needed for a lively art scene, and that there were many
more interested artists out there. Formed in early 1935, Syrens very quickly
opened up for wider membership by September and changed its name to
Society of Chinese Artists.

Thus the Shanghai alumni formed SOCA’s core. Tchang Ju-ch’i, Cai
Zhuzhen, Chen Chong Swee,3 Chen Pu Chie and Lee Kueh Sei were
graduates of Shanghai Art Academy, Shu Chun Lien of Xinhua Academy,
and Zhang Bohe of Shanghai University. Although it has yet to be
established if their periods of schooling coincided, we may infer that their
common Shanghai experience fostered a nucleus of shared interest that
brought them together while in Singapore. Here, they put their connection
to use, forming the art society to organise exhibitions and promote their art.

The society grew year by year, and by 1940 it was 40-strong. Four of its
members died during World War II, but SOCA bounced back after the war,
with 65 registered members in 1948.
