The noun “stack” usually refers to a pile of objects, such as “a stack of books”. It also means, by extension, a large quantity of something, as in the idiom “needle in a haystack”. In digital language, “stacks” can refer to computer memory storage. However, in libraryspeak, “stacks” are shelving units in a section of a library that is usually closed to the public.1 In most libraries, the less frequently consulted publications are usually kept in “closed stacks”.

The exhibition “From the Stacks: Highlights of the National Library” – which takes place from 30 January to 28 August 2016 at Level 10 of the National Library Building – presents over 100 items largely drawn from the library’s Rare Materials Collection. Given the size of the library’s 11,000-item strong collection, the exhibition provides only a snapshot of what its archives contain. But it is nonetheless a snapshot that presents a broad spectrum of materials across various subjects. 

On display are publications, manuscripts, maps, documents and photographs from the early 18th century to more recent times, which taken as a whole, represent a small but significant part of Singapore’s published heritage. Together, these items piece together a fascinating mosaic of Singapore’s history and its socio-political developments, and present stories about people, communities and vignettes of life in times past.

#### **The First School and Library**

As stories go, we must start from the beginning: the exhibition first traces the origins of the National Library, which is closely linked to the formation of the first school, the Singapore Institution – better known today as Raffles Institution.

Stamford Raffles envisioned Singapore as a commercial hub and a centre for learning and culture. Shortly after its founding in 1819, he drafted a proposal for the establishment of an institution of higher learning that would include a library and publishing function. One of the institution’s objectives was:

“To collect the scattered literature and traditions of the country, with whatever may illustrate their laws and customs, and to publish and circulate in a correct form the most important of these…to raise the character of the institution and to be useful 
or instructive to the people.”2

The proposal was not acted upon until 1823 
when Raffles convened a meeting to establish the 
Singapore Institution. At the recommendation of the missionary Robert Morrison, plans for a library, museum and printing press were included in the formation of the institution.3 However, its opening was delayed again for various reasons and deviated from Raffles’ original intent. Eventually, when the Singapore Free School moved into the building that was meant for the Singapore Institution at Bras Basah Road in 1837, it housed a small library that was available for public use for a small fee.

In response to appeals from residents for a proper public library that could be accessed beyond school hours, the Singapore Library eventually opened on 22 January 1845 on the premises of the Singapore Institution. The library, however, could only be used by paid subscribers. Such were the humble beginnings of the first school and library in Singapore.

#### **The First Printing Press**

Several items in the exhibition are rare editions of the earliest publications printed in Singapore. Interestingly, Singapore’s publishing history is closely intertwined with the proselytising activities of early Christian missionaries in the region. The earliest English, Chinese and Malay titles in the National Library are all outputs of printing presses in Singapore that were run by Protestant missions in the early years of the 19th century.

Christian missionaries followed the footsteps of Raffles and started work in Singapore soon after it was founded. The Reverend Samuel Milton of the London Missionary Society (LMS)
