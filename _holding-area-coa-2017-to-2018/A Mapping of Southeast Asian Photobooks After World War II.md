#### **Introduction**
There has been a surge in interest in photobooks since 2004, triggered by the
publication of a series of richly illustrated volumes by publisher Phaidon,
such as *The Photobook: A History Volume I (2004), The Photobook: A History
Volume II* (2006) and *The Photobook: A History Volume III* (2014). The
mastermind behind this series is British collector-photographer Martin
Parr, with critic-photographer Gerry Badger as its lead writer. Today, there
are fairs, festivals and symposiums dedicated to the photobook across the
world. It is fair to say that Parr has been hugely responsible for surfacing the
photobook as a field of interest and an object of desire.

In the preface of *The Photobook: A History Volume I*, Parr claims that
the photobook is the “final frontier of the undiscovered” in the research
of photography. Hence, his promotion of the photobook is an attempt
to “narrate a new history of photography”.1 Together, Badger and
Parr position the photobook at the chasms “between the aesthetic and
contextual battalions in the photo-critical wars”, and between art and the
mass medium, offering, in effect, a third way for photographers, curators,
collectors and art historians to approach photography.2

Because the titles featured in these volumes are largely based on Parr’s
enormous collection of photobooks, the selection is inevitably subjective and
eclectic. Materials – such as company books and propaganda publications
– frequently disparaged by art historians, curators and even photographers
themselves receive serious treatment from the series, partly because Parr is
personally invested in these photobooks. In a limited way, this has helped to
broaden the art of photography. Parr adds, “We have gone out of our way to
be inclusive, welcoming books from countries beyond the usual European-
American axis, which are normally overlooked in other histories”.3 Hence,
out of the 472 books chosen for the first two volumes of *The Photobook* series,
some have been placed in the chapter “Other Territories: The Worldwide
Photobook”, while productions from Japan are featured in the chapter,
“Provocative Materials for Thought: The Postwar Japanese Photobook”.

While Parr repeatedly notes that all histories are subjective, what they
have authored here is, of course, a global history written from a European
perspective. This becomes apparent through a casual reading of the writings
in these volumes where the references are overwhelmingly Euro-American
and the arguments intended as universal proclamations. While they claim
to attempt an “unofficial revisionist history” of photography through the
valorisation of photobooks, their account is based on and inevitably bound to
the official historiography, which continues to operate from imperial centres.4

This explains their claim, 10 years after the publication of *The Photobook:
A History Volume I*, that there is now a global photographic culture and
that the “photobook can be said to have been responsible for at least one
conspicuous success in the ongoing story of globalization”.5 Globalisation,
in this sense, refers to the uni-directional export of the photobook craze to
the rest of the world, as there is little evidence in the publications of Parr
and Badger to suggest that photobooks from any place in Asia, for instance,
have significantly impacted communities of practitioners in the imperial
centres. Furthermore, when they make the universalising claim that the
photobook has been more important to the history of creative photography than the mass-media journal or the gallery print, it is clear that experiences
in Southeast Asia have not been taken into account.6

While Parr and Badger assert that they have no interest in creating a new
canon in photography, the Phaidon publications have effectively accelerated
the canonisation and commodification of photobooks, chiefly benefitting
Parr and his associates.7 In effect, their narrative leaves photobook
productions from Southeast Asia outside of history and historiography.
When a photobook from Southeast Asia appears in their selection, it serves
to legitimise their global and eclectic taste. In other words, when they pick
publications from the “peripheral” regions of the world to fit this global
project, their selection inevitably helps to entrench the universality of the
Euro-American narrative of photography.

#### **Defining the Photobook**
Before turning our focus onto Southeast Asia, it is worthwhile to revisit
the ways in which the photobook has been defined in the current spate of
canonisation. To quote Parr and Badger at length:

   *A photobook is a book – with or without text – where the work’s<br>
   primary message is carried by photographs. It is a book authored<br>
   by a photographer or by someone editing and sequencing the work<br>
   of a photographer, or even a number of photographers…. For the<br>
   most part, we have considered the photobook as a specific ‘event’<br>
   … in which a group of photographs is brought together between<br>
   covers, each image placed so as to resonate with its fellows as the<br>
   pages are turned, making the collective meaning more important<br>
   than the images’ individual meanings…. As we define it, the<br>
   photobook has a particular subject – a specific theme…. And<br>
   in the main, it will not simply be a survey of a photographer’s<br>
   ‘greatest hits’, a career review. Monographs, or anthologies of<br>
   a particular photographer’s work at a given time in his or her<br>
   career have therefore not been included.*8
	 
Having provided what seems like an all-encompassing definition of the
photobook, they immediately temper it by including in their selection
the monographs of Henri Cartier-Bresson (*The Decisive Moment*, 1952)
and Walker Evans (*American Photographs*, 1938), while excluding those
made by some of the most important American Pictorialists, such as
Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Weston and Ansel Adams. According to Parr and
Badger, while the publications of the Pictorialists are typically sumptuous
in production, they are more like anthologies than cogent photobooks.9
And yet, in *The Chinese Photobook: From the 1900s to the Present* (2015),
co-edited by Parr – again based on his ever-growing collection – and
WassinkLundgren (with Badger serving as a contributor), anthologies
and exhibition catalogues such as *Peking Light Society Annual* (1929)
and *Holidays in Hong Kong* (1968) from the milieus of Pictorialism are
included in the selection.10 There is no doubt that these are significant
publications in the history of China photography. The same can be said
of the photobooks made by the aforementioned American Pictorialists,
*vis-à-vis* the historiography of American photography. Why do Parr and
his associates treat the productions of American and China Pictorialists
differently? It is beyond the scope of this paper to delve into the question.
But if I may suggest a possible reason, the discrepancy is perhaps due
to the fact that the imprint of the American Pictorialists has already
been fully acknowledged in the history of global photography, whereas
the historiography of China photography remains a work-in-progress,
especially for the English-speaking world. In this context, it is possible that
Parr and WassinkLundgren had felt somewhat obliged to present a history
of China photography via their valorisation of photobooks.

Returning to the issue of definition, U.S.-based Jörg Colberg, a widely
followed proponent of the photobook, offers a slightly different view. He
defines the photobook as a book that is viewed primarily for its photographs.
This is different from a cookbook, for instance, which is probably read for
its recipes rather than photographs.11 In contrast, Parr and Badger devote
a full chapter in *The Photobook: A History Volume II* to the company book because many of the greatest photographers produced books that had been
subsidised and commissioned by commercial corporations.12
