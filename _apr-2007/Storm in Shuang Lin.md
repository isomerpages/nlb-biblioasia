description: "Shuang Lin Monastery was once used as a training ground for people
  who volunteered their services at the Burma Road, which served as a supply
  route during the Sino-Japanese War in the 1930s. The monastery had a great
  impact on the lives of two men: Wu Hui Min, volunteer for the war effort, and
  Venerable Pu Liang, the abbot of the monastery. "
