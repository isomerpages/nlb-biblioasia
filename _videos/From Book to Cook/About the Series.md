### What Can Old Recipes Tell  Us About History and Food Heritage?

<i>From Book to Cook</i> is a brand new cooking show on Singaporeâ€™s old recipes found in the National Library collection. In every episode, our librarian-host Paddy Ong and a guest cook will make a dish or two from a vintage recipe. What happens when you put a librarian in the kitchen, armed with traditional kitchen tools and recipes from the past? Catch the series to find out!
