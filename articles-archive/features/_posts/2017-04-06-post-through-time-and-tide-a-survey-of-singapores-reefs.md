#### The reefs that fringed Singapore’s coastline and islands have served for centuries as maritime markers, fishing grounds and even homes for island communities. **Marcus Ng** rediscovers the stories that lurk beneath the waves.

*If the tides are high*<br>
*It never will appear,*<br>
*That little winking island*<br>
*Not very far from here;*<br>

*But if the tides are low*<br>
*And mud-flats stretch a mile,*<br>
*The little island rises*<br>
*To take the sun awhile.*<br>

In 1847, Dr Robert Little, a British surgeon, set off on a series of tours to Singapore’s southern islands, beginning with the isle known as Pulau Blakang Mati (present-day Sentosa).2 His journeys were no joyrides; the good doctor was investigating the source of “remittent fever” – a form of malaria – that had killed some three-fourths of the men posted to a signal station at Blakang Mati. The station was indispensable to navigation in the straits, but as no men were willing to serve at the ill-fated site, it was abandoned in 1845.
