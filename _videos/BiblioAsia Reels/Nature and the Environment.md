The Singapore Zoo was set up in 1973, but few people are aware that smaller animal enclosures and private zoos have existed on the island since colonial times. Such menageries, or collections of wild animals kept in captivity, were established by wealthy early settlers in Singapore. Learn about these lesser known zoos, why they were shut down, and how the Singapore Zoo at Mandai came about.

The skeleton of a blue whale was once the centrepiece of the former Raffles Museum. The skeleton was gifted to the National Museum of Malaysia in 1974. 

Another whale skeleton, that of an adult female sperm whale, is currently on display at the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum. The whale carcass was found drifting off the coast of Jurong Island in July 2015.
