#### **Episode summary** ####
For MasterChef Singapore judge Damian D’Silva, sea snail and papaya curry – known in the Kristang language as <i>cari papair cung siput chupaku</i> –  is a dish that brings back fond memories of foraging at the beach and cooking with his grandfather.

Damian explains how seafood has been a traditional protein for the Kristang people as he whips up his favourite childhood dish, while Paddy the host tries his best to ensure the snails don’t make a break for it.

#### **Recipes**
Damian learnt to make this dish while watching and helping his grandfather in the kitchen. Coconut milk is used in both Malay and Eurasian sea snail curry dishes, but the Eurasian version also includes semi-ripe papaya. According to Damian, this is the star ingredient that gives the curry its characteristic taste and sweetness. Since sea snails are seasonal, they can be easily substituted with other seafood such as prawns.

##### <b>Damian’s ingredients and instructions</b>

<b>For the _rempah_ (spice paste):</b><br>
50 g dried prawns<br>
30 g fresh red chillies<br>
15 g dried chillies<br>
400 g peeled shallots<br>
20 g toasted shrimp paste<br>
40 g soaked candlenuts<br>
30 g toasted coriander powder<br>
5 cm lemongrass (from root)<br>
10 g skinned galangal<br>
15 g peeled garlic<br>
6 g skinned fresh turmeric

<b>Other ingredients:</b><br>
1/2 a half-ripe papaya<br>
1 kg sea snails<br>
grated coconut<br>
cooking oil<br>
water

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soak the dried prawns in warm water and drain.

2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soak the dried chillies and drain.

3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blend into a fine paste the prawns, chillies, shallots, shrimp paste, candlenuts, coriander powder, lemongrass, galangal, garlic and turmeric.

4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Skin the papaya. Discard the seeds and cut across into slices.

5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wash the sea snails thoroughly in cold water. Discard broken shells. Use a chopper or a pair of pliers to cut off the pointed end.

6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soak the grated coconut in 800 ml warm water and extract the first part. Add another 800 ml warm water to extract the second part.

7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a pot on low to medium heat, add some cooking oil to the spice blend and cook until most of the liquid has evaporated.

8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bring up the heat and add the second part (thin extract) of the coconut milk and bring to a boil, stirring continuously.

9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lower the heat, add the sea snails and simmer till done, about 15 minutes.

10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Add some water, then the papaya slices, and cook until soft but still a little firm.

11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Add the first part (thick extract) of the coconut milk. Stir continuously until the liquid starts to simmer.

12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Add salt and sugar to taste. The gravy should not be too thick or watery.

The Eurasian community is a small but influential ethnic group that has been present in Singapore since the early 19th century. Eurasians are persons with mixed European and Asian lineage. Most Eurasians in Singapore can trace the European part of their ancestry to the Portuguese, Dutch or British, while others are of Danish, French, German, Italian or Spanish descent. The Asian component of their ancestry is usually derived from the Chinese, Malays or Indians.
