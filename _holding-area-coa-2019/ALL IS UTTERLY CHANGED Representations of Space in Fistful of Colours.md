*All is utterly changed, the map useless<br>
    for navigation in the lost city. Only an echo<br>
    remains*<br>
    – “Change Alley”, Boey Kim Cheng1

In Singapore, progress is inextricably tied up with loss – the disappearance
of landmarks and the displacement of people. This is a common theme
in Singapore literature. In his poem “Change Alley”, Boey Kim Cheng
meditates on one such site of loss, the eponymous lane that was once home
to a bazaar which ran from Raffles Place to Collyer Quay, and had been
famous for its eclectic goods and moneychangers from the early 1930s.2
Boey’s nameless speaker stands where the alley used to be, “searching still
the place / for signs leading home”. The alley’s disappearance becomes
emblematic of the wider physical and cultural erasure that accompanies
Singapore’s urban redevelopment. For Boey, composing this poem in the
1990s just as the “streets lost their names” and “the river forgot its source”,
Singaporeans were being severed from their own history.

Singapore’s growth, being limited by its tight geographical boundaries, is
to a large extent achieved through urban “renewal” projects. Even civic
landmarks, like the National Theatre (demolished in 1986) and the old
National Library (demolished in 2004), are not safe from the insatiable
need for more land and space to build high-rise homes and offices, roads,
MRT lines and other infrastructure. This has been deemed necessary both
to support a burgeoning population and to continually reinvent the city. As
Ryan Bishop, John Philips and Yeo Wei Wei explain, a city’s growth results
from “the spread of urban capitalism”; urban processes are “perpetuated
by a number of forces underpinned by the fundamentally economic ones
that govern modern existence, the locus of which is always the city”.3 For
a city-state like Singapore, urban renewal is critical to survival. Urban
planners and developers must anticipate the changing demands of the global
economy and remake the city in ever-new configurations to attract investors,
tourists and an increasingly international workforce.

But what is lost in the process? Singaporean literature has shown great
interest in engaging with this question. In Boey’s poem, for example, a city
is understood to be an organ of memory. As theorised by Mark Crinson,
redevelopment results in the effacement of this urban memory, so that the
city “can no longer act as a kind of guide or exemplar for the people living
in it”.4 The city is also the site of collective memory according to Steve Clark
– a kind of memory that can be “transferred between individuals and down
through generations”. This is of particular importance to the formation of
Singaporean identity, because “nationhood in a Singaporean context cannot
be defined through ethnicity or language […] Individuals, rather than
possessing personal recollections, are inter-connected through a distinctive
collective remembrance.”5 Singapore’s unceasing redevelopment disrupts the
accretion of this collective memory, affecting Singaporeans’ sense of identity
and history.

This essay explores how literary texts represent space and place by examining four works of Singaporean fiction that were produced after independence in the shadow of modernisation: Suchen Christine Lim’s *Fistful of Colours*, Goh Poh Seng’s *If We Dream Too Long*, and Philip Jeyaretnam’s *Raffles Place Ragtime* and *First Loves*. Spanning three decades after 1965, these works reflect a period when Singapore’s landscape underwent a dramatic transformation. While most of the current discourse about representations of space and place in Singaporean literature has focused on absence, this essay attempts to map the traces of these lost spaces and what has replaced them. As Jini Kim Watson explains, texts that foreground the built environment tell us much more than “immediate and physical changes”, as they preserve all the “competing new and old relations, ideologies, and imaginaries deposited in architectural form”.6 The four chosen texts thus map not only physical space, but also anxieties about modernity and modern life.

#### ***Fistful of Colours and If We Dream Too Long*: History, Memory and Urban Identity**

Published in 1993, Suchen Christine Lim’s novel *Fistful of Colours* is ostensibly set in a single day of the life of its protagonist Suwen, but the narrative spans multiple generations of Suwen’s family – from colonial times, through the Second World War, independence and into contemporary Singapore. While recounting these familial and national histories, Lim also documents Singapore’s urban history, giving particular attention to bygone places like pre-war Geylang and Great World Amusement Park (1929–78). Lim describes the amusement park in its heyday:

    *The Park was humming and buzzing with activities and gaiety.<br>    Within its large fenced-in enclosure were the open-air cinema,<br>    the getai or open-air stage for singing and comic sketches, the<br>    ronggeng platform for Malay dances and the Chinese opera<br>     theatre. Tucked in between the cinema, stages and theatres were<br>    numerous wooden stalls and zinc-roofed huts hawking cheap<br>    plastic wares: pails in gaudy reds and blues, utensils, toys, beads<br>    and buttons; aluminum pots and pans; poor quality clothes, towels;<br>    the minutiae of dressmaking like cards of bright buttons, reels of<br>    coloured threads, rolls of cheap satin lining, bales of cheap checks,<br>     packets of metal clips and boxes of buckles and beads. “Lelong!<br>    Lelong! Lai! Lai! Ten cents! Twenty cents only!” the hawkers called<br>     out to the housewives and their daughters milling under the glare<br>     
of the naked light bulbs and gasoline lamps*.7

Starting with the onomatopoeia of “humming and buzzing”, Lim builds
up layers of sound to recreate the park’s sonic landscape. The alliteration of
“pots and pans”, “cheap checks” and “boxes of buckles and beads” mirrors
the cries of the hawkers, and the contrast of harsh plosive sounds with the
more euphonic “*Lelong! Lelong! Lai! Lai!*” is cacophonous. Coupled with
the runaway acceleration conveyed by the list of items for sale, the noise
and buzz are palpable. In effect, Lim preserves the sense memory of Great
World Amusement Park, allowing us to appreciate it as a place “where lives
have been lived and [are] still felt as physically manifest”.8 With the park
now demolished – replaced by the shopping centre Great World City – it
no longer exists as a physical space. Lim’s novel thus becomes one of the few
ways through which it can still be accessed.

Lim’s portrayal of Great World touches on the novel’s wider theme of space
and ethnicity in Singapore. The hawkers shout in Malay and Chinese,
and the park contains both a “*ronggeng* platform for Malay dances” and
a “Chinese opera theatre”. The reader is invited to see Great World as a
microcosm of Singapore, where people of different ethnic and cultural
backgrounds mix freely. However, Lim problematises this utopian image in
a later scene, when one of the novel’s characters, Zul, waits for his fiancée
in a Housing Development Board car park.9 Zul and Jan are an interracial
couple, and Jan is going home to retrieve her belongings and confront her
father, who objects to the couples’ engagement. While waiting for Jan, Zul
recollects his childhood and reflects on how drastically his neighbourhood
has changed. Gone are “the flame trees, the angsanas, the lallang patch,
the muddy ditch (where he’d caught his first guppy) and the roadside
barber’s stall under the angsana tree”, replaced by the “new concrete boxes”
of a public housing estate. However, Zul still retains a mental map of his
old neighbourhood. When he looks at the “neat row of two-storey HDB
shophouses”, he still sees “the zinc and wood shops of the Chinese grocers and Indian dhobies” that used to be there. The built landscape becomes a palimpsest where traces of earlier forms can still be seen beneath the current forms, at least in Zul’s memories.

Lim links this spatial haunting to a kind of reactionary politics, where “the outer physical rim of our social hub [changes] faster than its core of age-old prejudices, cock-eyed perceptions and irrational fears”.10 Despite the modern and progressive image of Singapore that these landscapes project, racial prejudice still lurks beneath the surface, which in turn plays out in the sharp division between public and private spaces. While people may mix easily in public spaces, private spaces – such as the home and its attendant spaces of domesticity and intimacy – are still segregated. When Jan breaks the news of her engagement to her bigoted father, Zul must wait for her in the car park. He is not allowed into step into her family’s private space, an act that reveals the ethnic divides within Singaporean society. As Jan is eventually disowned by her father for marrying outside her race, their engagement is still transgressive. Lim therefore conveys this hypocritical attitude towards multiculturalism through her representation of space.

While such scenes in *Fistful of Colours* demonstrate how lost spaces linger on in memory, *If We Dream Too Long* suggests a different kind of haunting through the architectural remnants of Singapore’s colonial history. Goh Poh Seng’s 1972 novel follows its protagonist Kwang Meng as he tries to find his place in a rapidly changing world. Kwang Meng spends most of his time wandering through the city alone, and Goh spends the bulk of the narrative exhaustively describing these walks. In the novel’s opening pages, Kwang Meng walks through Singapore’s civic district:

    *To his right, across the street, the Singapore Cricket Club stood<br>     patronizingly at the corner of the Padang. A relic of the colonial<br>    past, but still the same syce-driven cars were parked outside in the<br>     members-only parking enclosure […] The English are durable,<br>     he thought, passing Victoria Memorial Hall and Theatre on his<br>     right, then crossing Connaught Bridge towards the grey imperial<br>     Fullerton Building nearby. All these colonial names, indelibly<br>     stamped everywhere. No wonder the English still feel very much at<br>     home here*.11

This area had been the seat of the colonial government, and most of
the colonial buildings remained even after independence, when urban
redevelopment swept the city. Through his representation of these spaces,
Goh implies that colonial attitudes still linger. The Cricket Club stands
“patronizingly”, an anthropomorphism that perhaps reflects the feelings
of superiority that the British administrators held towards their colonial
subjects. Furthermore, the use of “syce”, a Hindi word used colloquially in
British Malaya to refer to a chauffeur, coupled with the continued existence
of a segregated space – the members-only parking lot – suggests that the
hierarchies that shaped colonial society have simply carried on into postcolonial
Singapore. To Goh, these buildings with their “colonial names,
indelibly stamped everywhere”, are more than just landmarks or heritage
sites; they preserve, in Singaporeans’ urban and collective memories, the
scars of the colonial experience.

At the same time that Goh documents the continuity of selected aspects
of Singapore’s architectural past, he also traces the changes that other
parts of the country undergo. Crucially, he examines the process of land
reclamation:

    *The Government was reclaiming some one thousand acres of land<br>    
from the sea. They could see the yellow raw earth of the reclaimed<br>    
portion, […] Behind to their left, giant excavators were eating into<br>    
the hills […] The massive arms of the painted cranes towering above<br>    
them, were a skein of bright orange against the blue sky. The dusty,<br>    
dry yellow earth was crying out for grass and for trees. No doubt<br>    
they would be planted in the future. Along with the people*.12
