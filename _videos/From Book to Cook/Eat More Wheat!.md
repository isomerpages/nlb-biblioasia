#### **Episode summary** ####
In 1967, the Singapore government launched the Eat More Wheat campaign to reduce rice imports, because it was expensive compared to wheat. Award-winning cookbook author and culinary instructor Christopher Tan tells us about the campaign and makes a unique milk noodle soup dish from a 1969 cookbook, which was published in conjunction with the campaign.

<div style="background-color: white;"> The noodle batter recipe calls for evaporated milk, an unusual ingredient that suggests Dutch legacy in a possibly Indonesian-Chinese recipe. </div>


#### **Recipe**
This recipe by Mrs Choa was submitted to an Eat More Wheat cooking contest organised by Radio TV Singapore in the late 1960s. According to the contest criteria, the ingredients could not cost more than S$3 for a dish to serve four. For this recipe, the ingredients came up to S$1.32.

The recipe has measurements in ounces and *tahil*, as the units of measurements in Singapore were not standardised then. In 1971, two years after the recipe book was published, the metric sytem was adopted, and the use of imperial (e.g. ounces, gallons) and local (e.g. *kati*, *tahil*) measurements was dropped.

Christopher used a *murukku* press to make the noodles, after experimenting with various equipment, including a sieve as recommended by the recipe, and a *chendol* press.
