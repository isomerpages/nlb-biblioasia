title: Chinese Dialect Groups and Their Occupations in 19th and Early 20th
  Century Singapore
permalink: /vol-6/issue-1/Apr-2010/Singapore-chinese-dialect-occupation/
description: Librarian Jaclyn Teo draws on published English resources from the
  Lee Kong Chian Reference Library, and explores why certain Chinese dialect
  groups in Singapore, such as Hokkiens, Teochews, Cantonese, Hakkas and
  Hainanese, seemed to have specialised in specific trades and occupations,
  particularly during the early colonial period until the 1950s.
