#### **Introduction**
Amid the booming newspaper industry and active Chinese literary scene
in Singapore after the Second World War, two editors of newspaper literary
supplements stood out for their contributions: Xing Ying (杏影; 1911–67)
and Yao Zi (姚紫; 1920–82). The supplements under their editorship were
influential and informed local literary trends in the 1950s and 1960s.
Newspaper supplements played a significant role in promoting literature
and literary aesthetics and developing local literary talent, because they
were published more frequently than literary magazines and had a wider
audience.1 They typically appeared as a half-page section near the end of the
newspaper. For budding writers, these supplements served as a springboard
to the more prestigious literary magazines.2 The arts led to a paucity of reading materials4 and the dampening of the
literary scene.

This paper discusses the editorial styles of Xing Ying and Yao Zi
and their contributions to the literary scene in Singapore, such as the
multicultural elements they introduced to the supplements, and their
nurturing of young writers. The first section describes the postwar Chinese
literary scene and the two editors’ backgrounds. Section two focuses on Yao
Zi’s early newspaper supplement, *Lü Zhou* (绿洲, *Oasis*, November 1952–
January 1953), and Xing Ying’s *Wen Feng* (文风, *Literary Trends*, January
1954–August 1958), analysing their differing editorial styles and literary
approaches. The third section compares their mature literary supplements:
Yao Zi’s *Shi Ji Lu* (世纪路, *Century Road*, October 1953–January 1954) and
Xing Ying’s *Qing Nian Wen Yi* (青年文艺, *Youth Literature and Arts*, July
1960–February 1967). The last section focuses on the literary supplements,
*Zhou Mo Qing Nian* (周末青年, *Weekend Youth*, November 1952–December
1952) in *Lü Zhou*, and *Xin Miao* (新苗, *New Sprouts*, March–August 1958) in
*Wen Feng*. This section will also elaborate on the creation of new platforms
for amateur writers and compare the editors’ responses to young readers. 

#### **The Postwar Singapore Chinese Literary Scene, 1945–60**
In the early postwar period from 1945 to 1948 – known as the initial
period of peace or recovery (和平初期/光复初期) – the Singapore Chinese
literary scene flourished.3 Newspapers such as *Sin Chew Jit Poh* (星洲日报),
*Nanyang Siang Pau* (南洋商报) and *Min Pao* (民报), as well as literary
supplements like *Chen Xing* (晨星) and *Feng Xia* (风下), were revived.
Literary organisations and drama groups resumed their publications and
performances, adding to the vibrant arts scene.

A turning point came in 1948. In a bid to fight the communists in
Malaya, the British colonial government declared a state of emergency.
Newspapers such as *Min Sheng Pau* (民生报) and *Nan Chiao Jit Pao* (南侨
日报) closed down, many books from China were banned, and publications
in Malaya and Singapore were censored. The number of newspapers and
publications in Singapore dropped by about 14 percent, from 140 between
1945 and 1948, to 121 between 1949 and 1954. The control of literature and the arts led to a paucity of reading materials4 and the dampening of the
literary scene.

At the same time, this sociopolitical environment gave rise to a cultural
phenomenon known as “yellow culture” (黄色文化). Yellow culture refers
to activities and behaviour perceived as degenerate, such as dance clubs,
gambling and pornography.5 In October 1953, in what was seen as a tragic
consequence of yellow culture, a 16-year-old girl was raped and killed
at Pearl’s Hill. A public outcry ensued. Cultural institutions, student
organisations and schools organised anti-yellow culture campaigns, and
students from Chinese schools such as Chung Cheng High School and
The Chinese High School initiated the slogan, “Resist yellow culture”
(抵制黄色文化). The anti-yellow culture movement (反黄运动) received
widespread public support.

The movement was another turning point in the development of
Chinese literature and newspapers in Singapore. New compositions such
as songs, dramas, novels and poems emerged, many of which stressed the
importance of a healthy mind,6 in opposition to the corrupting influence of
yellow culture. The number of literary works increased by 25 percent, from
113 before the anti-yellow culture campaign, to 142 in 1955.7 In the same
year, there were 414 Chinese newspapers and publications, more than twice
compared to 163 in the prewar period from 1837 to 1941.8

The vibrant Chinese literary and newspaper scene in the 1950s can be
attributed to three reasons. First, the British colonial government relaxed its regulations on publications. Except for those championing extreme antigovernment
views, all other publications could be registered with licences.
This led to a resurgence of publishing activity, including materials with
“yellow” elements. Second, the increased rigour in Chinese education in the
1950s led to a larger readership for Chinese newspapers, which were more
affordable for the masses. Third, the import ban on publications from China
and Taiwan meant a scarcity of reading materials for Singapore’s Chinese
intellectuals, who thus turned to local Chinese newspapers.9

The 1950s also saw local Chinese beginning to reassess their affiliation
with Singapore vis-à-vis China. In 1955, the People’s Republic of China
announced that overseas Chinese would not be allowed to hold dual
nationalities. Local newspapers reflected the shifting sentiments of the day,
with interest clearly moving from China affairs to local developments.10
Articles on issues in China accounted for 69.7 percent of news coverage
in 1946, but declined to 22.5 percent by 1950, while articles related to
Singapore and Malaya rose from 19 percent in 1946 to 84.3 percent in 1959.11
During this period, the newspaper literary supplements edited by Yao Zi
and Xing Ying began to publish discussions on local issues and feature
multicultural elements.
