#### One of Singapore’s founding leaders, S. Rajaratnam, is today best known for drafting the Singapore Pledge and for being the country’s first Foreign Minister. His biographer Irene Ng, who recently edited the collection The Short Stories and Radio Plays of S. Rajaratnam, reveals his little-recognised literary side and discusses its importance to Singapore.




S. Rajaratnam is perhaps best remembered for his visionary role in shaping the national ideology and framing the foreign policy of Singapore as one of its founding leaders charting a yet-unknown future. What is less recognised is the rich literary legacy he left behind. Its creation predates the independence of Singapore in 1965, and even its self-governing status in 1959.

Before there was the politician and ideologue, there was the storyteller and the writer. Indeed, the conception and development of Singapore’s national ideology and foreign policy arguably owes much to the imaginative writer and creative thinker in him.

I would like to divide this essay into three parts. First, a brief introduction to his stories and radio plays. Second, the context in which he wrote the stories and plays. Third, an examination of the importance of his literary legacy.

#### **Introduction**

It is important to recognise that Rajaratnam was not just any writer, but a great one, once acclaimed in London—the centre of the English literary scene—where he lived for 12 years from 1935 to 1947. During the bleak years of World War II, when he turned to writing to eke a living, he proved himself to be a writer of uncommon imagination and talent.

His short stories were published in several journals and anthologies in the 1940s, and caught the attention of literary greats E.M. Forster and George Orwell. Forster described Rajaratnam’s debut “Famine”, published in 1941, as “touching and well-constructed” in one of his radio talks for the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). Orwell, who would later achieve fame for the political novels Animal Farm and *Nineteen Eighty-Four*, was working at the BBC in the early 1940s and invited Rajaratnam to write radio scripts.

By the mid-40s, Rajaratnam was billed “one of the leading Indian short story writers” in some anthologies. His reputation among the literary cognoscenti was sealed when his work appeared alongside those of the literary greats in an international anthology published in 1947. The volume was titled *A World of Great Stories: 115 Stories, The Best of Modern Literature*. The anthology also featured works by Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner, Scott Fitzgerald, Thomas Wolfe, John Steinbeck and James Joyce, to name a few.

His stories addressed themes of disaster and death, oppression and injustice, and the fears and follies of man, but also coursing through them is the transformative power of the human spirit and of reason. Although most of his stories are set against South Asian and Malayan
