**About**:	We recognise a fundamental challenge that many readers face: whilst the intention to read regularly is strong, sustaining this practice in isolation can prove difficult over time. However, we have discovered that reading within a supportive group environment, where participants can share insights and engage in meaningful exchanges, creates a powerful dynamic that naturally maintains reading enthusiasm and fosters long-term commitment to literary engagement. Our mission centres on promoting reading culture whilst creating an inclusive community that welcomes anyone with a genuine interest in literature and learning. 
Our book selections reflect this inclusive philosophy, encompassing a remarkably broad range of genres, topics, and perspectives. Beginning modestly with just three participants in our inaugural session three years ago, we have cultivated a thriving reading circle that now encompasses nearly a thousand members.
