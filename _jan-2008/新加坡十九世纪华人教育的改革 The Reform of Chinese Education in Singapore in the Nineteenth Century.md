description: "Education reforms and the modernisation of education in Singapore
  and Malaya are often attributed to political changes in China during the early
  20th century. Few remember the contributions of local intellectuals in
  spearheading education reforms before the 1900s. These reformers were
  multicultural both in their background and outlook. Two notable pioneers in
  this field are Chan Kim Boon and Khoo Seok Wan. "
