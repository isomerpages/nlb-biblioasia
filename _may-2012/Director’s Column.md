####  To be human is to be creative—to write, to paint and to make music that records our thoughts and dreams. Such artistic endeavours capture the spirit of the times and places in which they were created, transmitting to succeeding generations the hopes and fears of visionaries of the past.

This issue of *BiblioAsia* celebrates the artists among us and their contributions to the rich creative heritage of Singapore.

The lead feature by Irene Ng puts the spotlight on the radio plays of founding father S. Rajaratnam. While he was best known as a politician and statesman, Rajaratnam was also a gifted writer in his early years and produced a number of short stories and radio plays in the 1940s and 1950s. Irene discusses his literary legacy and how his plays outlined his vision of a “Singaporean Singapore” with the ability to transcend racial, cultural and religious divisions.

The art of veteran Singapore painter and calligrapher Lim Tze Peng, whose work graces the cover of this issue, forms the backdrop of our exploration into Singapore’s creative heritage. Yeo Mang Tong examines the changes in Lim’s painting style after 2006, in particular the shift from “painting what one sees” to “painting from one’s heart”.

Singapore’s rich multicultural literary heritage is further explored through the lives and works of local literary pioneers Yao Zi, P. Krishnan and Abdul Ghani Hamid, who each wrote in their mother tongues.
