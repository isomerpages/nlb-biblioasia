#### Lee Kong Chian Research Fellow&nbsp;_Zhang Liyan_&nbsp;examines the phenomenon and role of social innovation in Singapore’s historical and post-independence development through Chinese clan associations and grassroots organisations.

#### **Abstract**

Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have long been a force for social innovation in Singapore society. Along with the government and the private sector, they have been an important part of the “Singapore model” that has built a prosperous, just and caring society with a high quality of life that is the envy of the world. This paper concentrates on two types of NGOs: Chinese clan associations and grassroots organisations (GROs), both of which are extremely important from the specific standpoint of social innovation in Singapore. The influence of Chinese clan associations was at its peak in the colonial period when Singapore was an underdeveloped society with an immigrant Chinese majority. Grassroots organisations became important during the post-independence period of nationbuilding, in tandem with rapid economic development.

***Key Words:** Social Innovation, NGOs, Chinese Clan Association, Grassroots Organisation*

In this paper, I examine the phenomenon and role of social innovation in Singapore’s historical and post-independence development by analysing two types of NGOs – Chinese clan associations and grassroots organisations. I chose to focus on these two types of NGOs for two reasons. First, the Chinese clan associations were the NGOs that affected the most people in Singapore during most of the colonial period, since the Chinese constituted the majority of the population then. Second, the GROs deserve special attention because they are the first community-based NGOs which represented the entire population of Singapore, and also because they have provided a unique platform for cooperation and feedback on social and economic development between the people and the PAP government. Using these two case studies, I will examine the role NGOs played in the social innovation of Singapore.

#### **CASE STUDY 1: CHINESE CLAN ASSOCIATIONS** 
#### **The Emergence of Chinese Clan Associations**

The modern history of Singapore began in 1819 when Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles established a British port on the island. From 1824 to 1872, Singapore’s trade greatly increased as it grew from a trading post to an important port city, attracting many people from China to migrate to Singapore. “In the 1840s, after China lost the Opium War, there was an exodus of Chinese migrants to all parts of South-east Asia”. 1 The 1911 Revolution failed to solve China’s political, social and economic problems, and wars subsequently broke out between the different warlords. The unstable social situation forced many Chinese to leave their homeland to seek a better life elsewhere.

Most of the early Chinese migrants arrived in Singapore virtually penniless and faced such problems as finding employment, lodging and friends. Hence the birth of Chinese clan associations, which offered humanitarian assistance to the early immigrants. These associations helped new immigrants to settle down and seek employment. The other main preoccupations of the associations were sponsoring education and helping destitute members (Wickberg 1994).

In 2005, the Singapore Federation of Chinese Clan Associations published a book entitled *History of Clan Associations in Singapore*.2 This book documented 200 Chinese clan associations, comprising 116 kinship clan associations and 84 locality clan associations. More than 90% of these clan associations were set up before 1960. Table 1 provides information on the founding of some Chinese clan associations.

The development of Chinese clan associations was at least partly a result of colonial policy. Within the colonial structure, the British administration left the various ethnic communities alone to handle their own social, culture, economic and political affairs, seldom intervening at all. The non-interventionist policy of the British colonial government thus led to the necessity for and development of Chinese clan associations.

Before Singapore became self-governing in 1959, Chinese clan associations concentrated on humanitarian assistance, the religious needs and welfare of their members. The associations helped new immigrants find jobs and establish useful contacts, provided shelter and food, and ultimately, a sense of belonging to a community.

The clan associations also provided help to those in financial need. Early migrants had no social security, so clan associations provided welfare services to look after the sick, destitute and widows. The clan associations organised communal social and religious activities that offered much-needed interaction and breaks in the otherwise mundane and routine life of the coolies. One of the most important functions that clan associations served at that time was the offering of funeral services. Clan associations also acted as intermediaries in intracommunity conflicts: “The familiarity of cultural practices reproduced in the alien colonial environment helped many to cope with the monotonous working life, loneliness and homesickness that came with their isolated migrant lifestyle” (Khun Eng Kuah-Pearce 2006:54).

As the Chinese immigrant population grew, education, cultural and other social needs also had to be met. From the late 19th century onwards, these clan associations not only helped newly arrived people in their community to settle down, but also financed schools and scholarships for the children of migrant families.

#### **The Decline of Chinese Clan Associations**

At the Lee Clan General Association’s 86th Anniversary Dinner on 28 October 1992, Brigadier-General Lee Hsien Loong said: “Since independence in 1965, many of the services the clan used to provide have been taken over by the Government and other civic organisations…the government took over the running of schools and public services. Thus the Chinese clan started to lose its appeal and purpose towards the community and thus they experienced a dwindling membership.” 3 Furthermore, English was being taught as the first language in schools. This weakened the link between the clan associations and the younger generations. By the end of the 1970s, Singapore’s housing and urban renewal programme resettled people in new public housing estates, and this further eroded the connectedness of the Chinese community. This was a major factor that led to the decline of Chinese clan associations, some of which became inactive or dormant.
