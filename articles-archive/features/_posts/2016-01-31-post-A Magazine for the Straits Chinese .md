In the 1890s, a group of Peranakan (Straits-born Chinese) intellectuals decided to publish a magazine for the Straits community in Malaya.

With China in the throes of political change, the Straits Chinese in Malaya were politically and financially on the rise. The magazine’s editors, Lim Boon Keng and Song 
Ong Siang, were educated professionals and respected community leaders.1 Against this emerging backdrop, they sought not only to articulate a new definition of being Chinese in British Malaya, but also address the concerns of all who were Straits-born, including Malays, Eurasians and Indians.

Thus was born *The Straits Chinese Magazine: A Quarterly Journal of Oriental and Occidental Culture*. First published in March 1897, the magazine was in circulation for 11 years. As the first English magazine 
entirely edited and published by Malayans,2 it offered a rich collection of some of the earliest published local literary works and social commentaries by the Straits Chinese, with an aim to “promote intellectual activity 
amongst the Straits-born people”.3

Although the magazine was styled 
after similar journals by literary societies 
in London, its contents were influenced by 
a growing interest in Chinese culture – a 
response perhaps by the Chinese against 
a local press that was largely dominated by 
British journalists.4
The magazine’s writers and its audience were primarily the Peranakan community, localised Chinese who having resided 
in the Straits Settlements for several generations, had adopted indigenous practices 
such as speaking in Baba Malay and eating 
spicy food, but at the same time, equally 
at ease with English customs and Chinese 
culture. Many of the magazine’s writers were 
distinguished leaders in the community, 
like Tan Teck Soon, who was educated in 
Singapore and China, and well-regarded 
for his erudite talks on Chinese culture.5
The magazine was a resounding success with 800 copies of its inaugural issue 
selling out in March 1897. Subscriptions 
cost $1.50 a year, and by the turn of the 20th 
century, The Straits Chinese Magazine had 
achieved a wide circulation, both in Malaya 
as well as in “distant corners of the globe”.6
Subsequent issues featured regular columns 
in the form of letters from London, Java, 
Melaka and Penang. By 1904, the magazine 
was read in “quiet homes in England and 
America”,7
 and was found in the collections
