#### **Introduction**
This essay explores the impact of the emerging scholarly discipline of the
“science of religion” on the Confucianist movement in Singapore in the late
19th and early 20th centuries. Anna Sun’s recent study on the modern origin of Confucianism as a “world religion” foregrounds the role of James Legge, a missionary and an Oxford University professor, in the establishment and dissemination of the scholarly category of “Confucianism” in the period.1
However, her study is limited to an exploration of the impact of Legge’s
scholarship on the study of world religions in the Western academic and
missionary circles.

The author hardly mentions Legge’s career in Malacca and the influence his study of Chinese classics had on missionary and Confucian reformist circles in Singapore at the turn of the 20th century. While it delineates a historical arc that connects mutual contestations between the secular and religious interpretations of Confucianism from the 19th century British Empire to present-day China, her book neglects analogous debates articulated in the Confucianist and Christian intellectual circles in the Straits of Malacca.

This essay is an attempt to include the voices of Confucian reformers in the
Straits of Malacca in the study of the history of Confucianism in its modern,
global format. It will highlight the formative role of intellectual exchanges,
between Western scholars and/or missionaries and local Confucianist
thinkers, in the conceptualisation of Confucianism as, simultaneously, a
national (Chinese) religion and transnational (global) political force. Apart
from East Asian societies and states, Confucianism has also played an
important role in Southeast Asia. Historical trajectories behind the relatively
recent (2006) acknowledgement of Confucianism as a state-sponsored
religion in Indonesia, and Confucianism as an ethical regime that governs
the conditions to sociability in postcolonial Singapore, deserve comparative
studies of their own.

As an initial step in that direction, this essay discusses the articulations of
Confucianism through the perspective of the comparative study of religions,
as it was understood by the Confucian reformers in Singapore – led by Lim
Boon Keng – at the turn of the 20th century. I will argue that the debates
between the Chinese reformists and the Straits-based British missionaries
on the religious status of Confucianism cannot be properly understood
without taking Legge’s academic and missionary/theological authority into
consideration. This argument is supported by an analysis of a series of essays
and notes written by Lim during the period. By placing Legge within the
history of the Confucian reformist movement in the Straits of Malacca, I
aim to foreground the constitutive role of Southeast Asian reformers in the
modern history of Confucianism in its global dimension.

Missionaries and scholars of world religions played a role in the debates
where Confucianism was introduced onto the world map as a religion and
promoted as a leading force in a new, China-centred global order as it was
imagined from within the Straits of Malacca. The religion-related debates in
the Straits of Malacca were no exception in the period under consideration.
According to Peter van der Veer, religions in the Chinese and Indian
modern contexts were transformed into “moral sources of citizenship and
national belonging” – rather than marginalised or eliminated – through
their contact with the emerging political project of secularism as a colonial
governing tool of religious and cultural difference.2

Apart from playing a crucial role in the formulation of “national imaginaries”,
the encounter with the imperial West enabled religions to be utilised to form
– or imagine – supranational alliances and “alternative visions of the moral
state”.3 This essay will show that the case of Lim Boon Keng’s articulations
of Confucianism, as a religion and source of transnational moral citizenship,
is an excellent example of the contradictory effect of secularism in a colonial
setting, in van der Veer’s sense. In the spirit of the times, Legge conceptualised
Confucian religion as a defining element of the Chinese race/nation. It was
through a critical study of Legge’s translations, conceived from within the
imperial context of Britain and related global missionary aspirations, that
Lim developed his perspective of Confucianism as, simultaneously, a national
(Chinese) and supranational (global) social and historical force, fit to form the
basis of a new world order. In other words, Lim conceptualised the new world
with a reformed China as its leader.

This essay will show that Lim’s personal engagement in, or substantial
proximity to, the mutually opposing/constitutive social and historical
projects – i.e. Christian proselytisation and the Confucianist movement,
were, in van der Veer’s sense, responsible for the formation of a neutral
cognitive space. That space was contained in the newly established “science
of religion” which, with its authority anchored in rationality and “scientific
objectivity”, had a pacifying effect on the debate between missionaries and
Confucian reformists. In other words, the authority of deciding about the
religious or secular/philosophical nature of Confucianism was placed in the
realm of science, at a distance from ecclesiastic authorities. Lim’s multiple
political alliances (to Britain and a reformed China) also decidedly marked
his image of Confucianism as compatible with liberal democracy. In short,
Lim embraced the lessons learned from his reading of the scientific approach
to the study of world religions and used them to build his view of a new
world history with Confucianism as its progressive goal. In this process, Lim
adopted, contested or elaborated on Legge’s translations of the Confucian
classics and views on Confucianism in relation to Christianity.

Lim’s crucial role in the Confucianist movement in the Straits has already
received substantial scholarly attention.4 However, his engagement with Legge’s scholarly work is noted only in passing.5 In addition, Lim’s
knowledge of the science of religion and its impact on his articulation of
Confucianism as a world religion has entirely evaded the attention of the
scholars working on the topic.

This essay, in turn, foregrounds the historical entanglement, between
Protestant contestations and scholarly world-religion consolidations of
Confucianism, in the construction of Lim’s view of this religion, and its
place in the new world order as a political form of universal humanity,
and a condition to modern, transnational and moral citizenship. Apart
from van der Veer’s study, my approach to the study of the emergence of
Confucianism, as a religion and global ethos in the Straits of Malacca, is
also indebted to Tomoko Masuzawa’s study of the history of the concept
of “world religion” within the discipline of science of religion and, in
particular, the epistemic formation of this concept’s universalistic, supraethnic,
or transnational, character.6

As Masuzawa shows, during the 19th century, the category of “world
religion” emerged to help articulate the self-image of Europe as an ideal
model of universal history, or leader of an international, global order on
the one hand. On the other, this new category also served to (self) portray
Europe as the sole custodian of harmonious regulation of internal differences
within nation-states.7 Stated otherwise, world religions through their study
within the new discipline of science of religion were approached as defining
elements of non-European nations.8 The study presented in this essay, like
those of van der Veer’s and Sun’s, acknowledges the ultimate intellectual
legacy of Talal Asad’s enquiry into the mutual formation of the religious and
the secular through the colonial encounter.9

Only when approached as a singular analytical field of enquiry can Lim’s
views of Confucianism, simultaneously a religion and global political force,
be understood as an effect of mutually transformative historical exchanges
between the opposing social movements of Christian proselytisation (and
related global domination) and Confucianist Chinese emancipation.

#### **James Legge and the Study of Confucianism**
James Legge (1815–1897) was the first professor of Chinese at Oxford
University, where he worked from 1876 until his death. Before becoming
a professor, Legge spent a large part of his life (1839–1873) as a missionary
for the London Missionary Society, with postings in Malacca and Hong
Kong.10 In the contemporary academic world, Legge is best remembered for
his English translations of the Chinese classics, as well as his engagement in
the scientific study of Chinese religions in general – foremost of which was
Confucianism.11 His lasting scholarly reputation was instrumental in shaping
the current global perception of Confucianism as a defining element of
Chinese culture, nation and politics.

Legge’s first missionary posting in Malacca only lasted four years, from
1839 to 1843. Nevertheless, by the time of his death, Legge was a wellknown
Christian proselytiser, scholar and educationalist in the Anglo-
Chinese circles in Singapore. Early in his career, Legge personally financed
the education of Song Hoot Kiam, who was to become one of the most
prominent English-educated Christian Chinese intellectuals in Singapore,
and two other boys in Hong Kong and Scotland.12

Song commemorated Legge’s life in a few obituaries13 published in *The
Straits Chinese Magazine: A Quarterly Journal of Oriental and Occidental Culture* upon Legge’s death in 1897.14 This periodical, in circulation
between 1897 and 1907, was co-founded and co-edited by Song’s son,
Song Ong Siang, a Chinese Christian community leader and an English-educated
intellectual. Along with Lim, Song Ong Siang was a recipient
of the Queen’s Scholarship, the award that enabled both men to study
in Britain.15
During his studies in Britain in the late 1880s or early 1890s, Song Ong
Siang visited Legge at his home in Oxford, where the latter was working on
his translations of Chinese texts.16 Although this visit did not prompt Song
Ong Siang “to take up the study of Chinese classics”,17 his fellow Chinese
reformist Lim showed great interest in Legge’s translations and views of
Confucianism.

*The Straits Chinese Magazine*, or SCM, was intended, among other goals, to
encourage debate among the Straits intellectual elite of “all nationalities who
are in every respect better educated than those of a former generation”.18
Lim, one of the most vociferous Singaporean Confucian reformists of the
period, who was also a founder and co-editor of the SCM,19 published
his critiques of Legge’s understanding of Confucianism and proposed a
different picture of the religion’s role in facilitating the overall progress of
the Chinese people. In so doing, Lim made an invaluable contribution to
the then emerging concept of “objective” or “scientific” study of religion,
which explored Confucianism as a “world religion” within the new scholarly
discipline of comparative religion.20

Masuzawa shows that one of the fathers of the science of religion – known
today as comparative religion – Friedrich Max Müller, developed this
discipline based on his expertise in Sanskrit philology and language.21
Specifically, between 1861 and 1870, Max Müller formulated his science of
religion upon his previous field of expertise, the science of language. His
comparative study of religion was, in fact, based on comparative philology.
The analytical connection between race/nationality, language/culture and
religion, which has endured to the present, has been attributed to Max
Müller. This despite the fact that, as Masuzawa argues, Max Müller was
openly against establishing a relationship of biological or physiological
causality between languages and races.

In other words, Max Müller opposed, unsuccessfully, the development of
racialist philology.22 His opposition was directed at the anthropological
prescriptions for “race” prevalent at the time, which suggested discrepant
origins of different races, where “difference” was treated as a biological
fact. Instead, Max Müller was in favour of a shared origin of humankind,
supported through his comparative study of the family of languages.23
Apart from this particular racial or national aspect of religion, Masuzawa
notes that the imperial conquest and aspirations of Christianity, and also
encounters with Buddhism, simultaneously shaped the transnational or
supra-racial character (or aspirations) of religions.24

Max Müller’s concept of “universalistic humanity”25 and the historical
entanglement between the Chinese race and Confucianism all made a
decisive impact on Lim’s articulation of a Confucianist world order, as
discussed later in this essay. Whereas the intellectual connection between
Max Müller’s science of religion and Lim’s Confucianism remain
unexamined, academic collaboration between Max Müller and Legge is a
well-studied phenomenon.
