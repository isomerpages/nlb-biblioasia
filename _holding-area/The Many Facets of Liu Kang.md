In 1952, four Singapore artists – Chen Chong Swee, Chen Wen Hsi, Cheong Soo Pieng and Liu Kang – embarked on a two-month sketching trip to Java and Bali between 8 June and 28 July. Their aim was to experience and capture a cultural milieu, way of life and landscapes different from what they could find in Singapore. The following year, they presented a group exhibition of more than 100 paintings and sketches arising from the trip.[^1]
