#### Lee Kong Chian Research Fellow _Chia Yeow Tong_ examines the reasons for the emergence of Education for Living, regarded as the de facto civics education programme in 1970s Singapore, and why it was subsequently abandoned.
 
Forging a sense of national identity has always been high on the agenda of the Singapore Government. Ever since the country’s independence, various civics and citizenship education programmes have been set in motion, only to be subsequently discontinued and replaced with other initiatives. Education for Living (EFL) was regarded as the de facto civics education programme in 1970s Singapore. We look at the reasons that led to the emergence of 
the programme and why it was abandoned.

#### **Advent of EFL**

Developed for the purpose of imparting social and moral education, EFL integrated Civics with History and Geography. This was considered necessary to “help pupils to understand and live under the changing conditions” (Chew, 1988, p. 72; Ong, 1979, p. 2).

The objectives of EFL were as follows:

&emsp;To help pupils become aware of the purpose and<br>&emsp;importance of nation building and their duties as<br>&emsp;loyal, patriotic, responsible and law-abiding citizens.<br>
&emsp;To enable pupils to obtain a better understanding of<br> &emsp;how \[Singapore\] developed and of \[its\] geographical<br>&emsp;environment<br><br>&emsp;To help pupils to understand and appreciate<br>&emsp;the desirable elements of Eastern and Western<br>&emsp;traditions<br><br>
&emsp;To guide pupils to perceive the relationship between<br>&emsp;man and society and in turn, between society and<br>&emsp;the world, so that they would be able to live in a<br>&emsp;multi-racial and multi-cultural society in peace and<br>&emsp;harmony. (Ong, 1979, p. 3)

It is interesting to note that while the EFL syllabus aimed to introduce students to the best of Eastern and Western values, there was to be a shift in orientation towards the end of the 1970s wherein the west was demonised and the east valorised.

Like Civics, EFL was taught in the mother tongue. The government believed that “Asian moral and social values, and the attitudes such as closeness in family ties, filial duties and loyalty (could) be conveyed and understood better in Asian languages”, and that pupils would become more aware of their cultural roots and develop a stronger sense of nationhood “if they knew their own language” (Gopinathan, 1991, p. 279). Christine Han (1996) challenged this assumption:
