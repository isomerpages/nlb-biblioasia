#### **Writers and Reading Clubs**
Author: Lee Kok Meng
<br>
Given the challenges of book publishing in Singapore, we pay special attention to local authors' works each year, actively selecting them for book discussions and inviting authors to interact with readers in person. This allows readers to gain deeper insights into the creative process behind the works while providing authors with a valuable platform to receive reader feedback. In recent years, some authors and publishers have proactively invited Xin Zhi Reading Club to host or co-host book launches, fully demonstrating the vital role reading clubs play in reading culture and actively supporting local literary creation.

#### **Diversified Reading Guidance: Emerging Technology, Finance, and Humanities**
Author: Ong Eng Hong
<br>
In today's era of rapid advancement in emerging technology and fintech, we believe there is an even greater need to consider humanistic values in technological development: How should technology enhance human quality of life? What role should humans play in the digital age? Our team continues to focus on these fundamental questions. For example, at our 29 March 2025 session "One Person as a Team – Leveraging AI to Enhance Productivity", we explored how to make AI a capable assistant to humans rather than simply replacing them. We believe that only by developing technology while maintaining humanistic concern can we create truly meaningful progress.

#### **Reading Clubs in the Digital Age**
Author: Xia Xia
<br>
The digital age presents reading clubs with both new opportunities and challenges. While technological tools make reading and communication more convenient, they also bring issues such as divided attention.

#### **The Value of Reading Clubs**
Author: Lim Jie Xi
<br>
The power of literature lies in how authors give voice to diverse characters within narrative frameworks, allowing these voices to explore issues from multiple perspectives. When we read these stories, we can temporarily set aside our own positions, listen to these varied voices, and connect emotionally with the characters. This was precisely the motivation behind “Reading through Turbulent Times” reading club’s decision to move online during the pandemic. By bringing together authors and readers from all over the world, the club aimed to encourage participants to set aside their prejudices, immerse themselves in the stories, and foster empathy that would deepen mutual understanding.
