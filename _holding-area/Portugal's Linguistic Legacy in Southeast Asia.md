#### While Portugal may not have had a large presence in this region, remnants of the Portuguese language continue to linger on, in some places more than others.
By João Oliveira

Learning a new language opens your mind to new experiences. Sometimes, though, it can open your mind to old ones as well. I began learning Bahasa Indonesia a few years ago, first on my own, and then later under a teacher. Along the way, I kept encountering Indonesian words that sounded a lot like Portuguese words, mainly because those Portuguese words had entered the Indonesian language.

An Indonesian person wakes up in the morning when the sun comes through the *jendela* (from the Portuguese *janela*, or “window”). He gets out of bed, and after completing his morning routine, he takes his business *kemeja* (*camisa*; “shirt”) out of his *almari* (*armário*; “closet”) and gets changed for work.

He goes to the kitchen, sits down at the *meja* (*mesa*; “table”) and has bread with *mentega* (*manteiga*; “butter”) or maybe some *keju* (*queijo*; “cheese”) for breakfast. Later, he puts on his *sepatu-sepatu* (*sapato*; “shoes”) and goes to work in his *kereta* (from the archaic *carreta*; “car”). On his way to the office, he sends his daughter, who is holding a boneka (boneca; “doll”) in her hands, to sekolah (escola; “school”). On the weekend, that is, on sabtu (sábado; “Saturday”) and minggu (domingo; “Sunday”), he goes to a pesta (festa; “party”) with his friends.
