#### The former newsreader AGS Danaraj was also a pioneering town planner, who always made time to help the less fortunate.
By Edgar J. Danaraj

Some people might remember AGS Danaraj as a newsreader on radio and television in the 1960s and 70s. But many might not know that beyond reading the news, Danaraj was an important figure in the development of Singapore’s urban landscape as one of the nation’s pioneering town planners.

#### **On the News**

Danaraj, who was my father, was a part-time radio and television newsreader with the Radio Television Singapura and Singapore Broadcasting Cooperation for 19 years in the 1960s and 1970s.&nbsp; He spent two years on a government scholarship at Durham University in Britain from 1958 to 1960 to study town planning. His interest and love for journalism blossomed while he was there and he would freelance for newspapers during term breaks. He recalled, "I risked my life when I covered the Nottingham racial riots back in the 60s, but I loved every minute of it. I was paid about $50 to $200 for an article.”[^1]

When Danaraj returned to Singapore, he spoke with a British accent, commonly known as pure “received pronunciation” or “The Queen’s English”. This made his voice distinctive and easily recognised. After six months of training, he went on air.

Being a part-time newsreader could occasionally be harrowing. Once, he was so late for a news-reading session because of a traffic jam that he abandoned his car at Mount Alvernia and hailed a passing police car. He asked them for a ride to the broadcasting station and the police not only gave him a lift, they even sounded their sirens to get him there.[^2]&nbsp;

As a newsreader, Danaraj presented more than 38 broadcasts on radio and television. He covered a diverse range of topics, from “Redeveloping Toa Payoh”[^3] and “Rebuilding the City”[^4] to “Batik-Making”[^5] and “Keeping Birds as a Hobby”.[^6]

#### **Career: Planning a Nation**

Danaraj was born in Pahang, Malaysia in 1931. His family moved to Singapore in 1940, where he studied at St. Andrew’s School from 1947–49.[^7] In 1950, when he was 19, he joined the Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT) as an officer and was a draughtsman of Sir George Pepler’s Diagnostic Survey Team, whose work involved the preparation of the 20-year Master Plan for Singapore. (Pepler was the Town Planning Consultant to the Singapore government).[^8] Danaraj was also part of the team that organised the exhibition “Homes of Singapore” that was held at the Victoria Concert Hall in 1951.[^9]

The objective of the Master Plan and survey was to propose land use on the island and act as a guide for its physical growth. Danaraj was part of the team that conducted an island-wide diagnostic survey of Singapore, surveying land and building use of both city and rural areas, as well as traffic flow. It provided detailed zoning and density parameters to guide the country’s physical development.[^10] The survey offered a summary of rural areas requiring improvement, identifying issues such as overcrowding, high congestion, housing, recreation for the growing population, sufficient land reserves, eliminating slums, and establishing a green belt around the city to limit urban sprawl.[^11]

After eight years at SIT, Danaraj received a two-year scholarship to the University of Durham King’s College in Britain in 1958.[^12] There, he completed his Diploma in Town Planning. During that time, he was influenced by modern town planning in other European countries such as France, Italy, Belgium, and Germany.[^13] Upon his graduation in 1960, he joined the Planning Department within the Prime Minister’s Office[^14] and took on the role of central planning and commenced work to rebuild the city.[^15]
