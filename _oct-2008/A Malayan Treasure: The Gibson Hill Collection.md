description: Dr Carl Alexander Gibson-Hill was the last expatriate director of
  the Raffles Museum. He was also at one point president of the Malayan Branch
  of the Royal Asiatic Society. On 18 June 1965, Mrs Loke Yew, the mother of
  Loke Wan Tho who had established Cathay Organisation, donated the Gibson-Hill
  Collection to the National Library on Lokeâ€™s behalf, almost a year after his
  death from a plane crash.
