third_nav_title: Hawker Culture in Singapore
---
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>Most people around the world conceive of hawkers as itinerant, transient,
and they move from place to place. So, I think for example Mexico and Malaysia,
or Thailand. Okay, when you go to the streets of Bangkok. People are flanking
the streets selling…&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>They have kiosks, they’re pushing them about.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>Yeah. Sometimes they don’t even have a kiosk, they have a basket. They
carry their basket around, or they sit on the streets. But I think for
most Singaporeans, and especially the younger generations, “hawkers” means
something completely different. When I think of hawker, I think of a hawker
centre, something that’s very formalised, very institutionalised and very
clean.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And Singapore has made that journey from being itinerant, informal in
some sense, to a hawking culture that is very formalised. And this is a
very intentional move, informed by the circumstances of Singapore throughout
our history.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Music playing]&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>You’re listening to<em> BiblioAsia+</em>, a podcast produced by the National
Library of Singapore. At <em>BiblioAsia</em>, we tell stories about Singapore’s
past. Some familiar, others forgotten, all fascinating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chicken rice, <em>mee siam</em>, <em>roti prata</em>. Hawker food is one
of the best things about life in Singapore. Hawkers, hawker food and hawker
centres are part of what makes Singapore so unique. Hawker culture is so
important to us that we succeeded in having it inscribed on UNESCO’s list
of humanity’s intangible cultural heritage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s all well and good, but have you ever stopped to think? What exactly
is a hawker? When you say hawker in Singapore, you think of a person selling
cooked food in a place called a hawker centre, where a lot of other people
are selling cooked food. The food is tasty and perhaps, more importantly,
it’s affordable. However, if you consult a dictionary, the definition you’ll
find doesn’t really match what we see in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Oxford English Dictionary, for example, defines a hawker as a person
who goes from place-to-place selling goods. Wikipedia says a hawker is
a vendor of merchandise that is easily transported. In both these definitions,
mobility is a key concept. However, hawker centres are the opposite of
mobile, and that’s perhaps the first clue that the word hawker is used
differently in Singapore compared to other places where at least today,
it is used differently compared to other places.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here to tell us all about hawker and hawker culture is the aptly named
Ryan Kueh<em>.</em> Ryan is the author of <em>From Streets to Stalls</em>,
which traces the evolution of hawkers in Singapore, starting all the way
back in the 14th century. He has a bachelor’s degree from Yale-NUS, and
a master’s degree from Tsinghua University under the Schwarzman Scholars
programme. Research is a particular passion of his.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the show, Ryan. How have you been?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>Hi Jimmy, thank you for welcoming me to the show. I’ve been well. Looking
forward to sharing my thoughts on hawker culture. And as you’ve introduced,
I think Singaporeans conceive of hawkers quite differently to most people
around the world and I’m very glad to share more about that.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay, I’d like you to perhaps tell me then, how is it that in Singapore
we have this concept of hawker and hawker centres, but that’s different
from everywhere else.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>I think that’s a great question. I think as you rightly pointed out, most
people around the world conceive of hawkers as itinerant, transient, and
they move from place-to-place. So I think for example Mexico and Malaysia,
or Thailand. Okay, when you go to the streets of Bangkok. People are flanking
the streets selling –&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>They have kiosks, they’re pushing them about.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>Yeah. Sometimes they don’t even have a kiosk, they have a basket. They
carry their basket around, or they sit on the streets. But I think for
most Singaporeans, and especially the younger generations, “hawkers” means
something completely different. When I think of hawker, I think of a hawker
centre, something that’s very formalised, very institutionalised and very
clean.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And Singapore has made that journey from being itinerant, informal in
some sense, to a hawking culture that is very formalised. And this is a
very intentional move, informed by the circumstances of Singapore throughout
our history.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I think that was what the book was trying to elucidate. I think the
most unique thing is how these different hawker evolution has come to let
Singaporeans conceive of it as a culture? It’s something that is uniquely
Singaporean, and I think especially for a small country like ourselves,
that’s extremely important.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay. I want to get back to that evolution in a bit, but what I was really
fascinated to find is that you start off your history of hawker culture
or hawkers in Singapore by going back to the 14th century. And I didn’t
know where the fossils of <em>char kway teow</em> were found on Fort Canning.
How did you do that?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>Unfortunately, there were no fossils of <em>char kway teow</em> or chicken
rice in the 14th century. But I think what I really wanted to challenge
was the idea that currently, in common parlance, we conceive of hawkers
as starting during the colonial era. And I wanted to see whether that could
be challenged and whether we could go further back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the way I did this was to relook the pre-conditions of hawking. What
were the conditions that encouraged hawkers to be present in a polity.
And I think I found three conditions. The first condition was transient
travelers and merchants looking to trade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two was a local market that facilitated trade and three is some currency.
So I think looking back at Singapore’s history, Temasek, that empire that
existed in Singapore during the 13th, 14th century, seems to fit those
pre-conditions. It was very intertwined regional trade. It routinely hosted
Arab and Chinese visitors. And literary sources from <em>Sejarah Melayu</em>,
Wang Dayuan points to how there was indeed a marketplace in Temasek and
that’s fascinating. How they used currencies to trade in Singapore. It
could be Sri Lankan coins. We also found cowries, which is a form of seashell.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay, so there was money. There was a kind of market and I think there
were transient travelers or traders but the transient element, why is that
important?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>I think a transient element is tremendously important because if you think
about an empire, if they [were] hosting dignitaries or ambassadors, they
usually would go out to the market and buy their food but what you really
needed was, I would say, a class of individuals who would not be hosted
and who had to go out and buy food in inns or restaurants, that might happen.
In that formalisation, they could have been hawkers themselves. So I think
the transient element is very important.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay, you’re really extrapolating from environmental conditions to say,
well, makes sense, and I agree with you. I mean, a bunch of people, they
come on their ships. They need to eat something. They don’t have a lot
of money, maybe. Restaurants are full because they check their Google Maps
and they say, “Oh, this is like a really good restaurant, but everybody
goes, I don’t want to go there”. And so, an economy springs up around providing
food for these people. But down into the 19th century, we actually have
colonial records of people recording this in action. People springing up,
the ones paying them. They see a gap in the market and they go and fill
it. It wasn’t necessarily welcomed during the colonial period. You want
to talk about that?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>I think hawking during the colonial times wasn’t really welcomed for two
main reasons. I think first is because they provided a lot of administrative
challenges. For example, they would challenge public health. I think hawkers
back then weren’t the cleanest. They would improperly dispose of waste,
they would use one water source to cook your <em>bak chor mee</em> and wash
it and use the same water source to wash your dishes and then cook your <em>bak chor mee</em> again.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>That’s why it tasted so good.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>Perhaps that’s why the food used to taste better. No, I’m joking but yes,
I think it was linked to cholera, typhoid and varying degrees of public
health issues and this was even exacerbated by the fact that people weren’t
inoculated back then.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think the second issue was urban discipline. They would flank the streets.
There weren’t really any licensing or hawker centres back then and they
would go where the crowd was, and this was usually at the docks. This really
caused a lot of administrative challenges. It caused congestion for both
people and motor vehicles. And from the administration’s perspective, those
were a few headaches for them. But I think it is also important to understand
the drivers of why people went into hawking. At the end of the day, there
were a lot of immigrants, especially when they came to Singapore looking
for a job or vocation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were a lot of males of working age, and when they couldn’t find
a job, I think hawking was usually one of the easiest transitory vocations
to go into. For example, [if] I were a bricklayer and the jobs closed or
it was a contract job, I could buy a wok and sell some stuff on the streets
and when I found a job, I could move on again. So, it’s a very low barrier
of entry vocation and that’s what made it so appealing.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Not much capex required.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>Not much capex required and at that time, not much tax.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>The thing is, however, even though they were obviously a nuisance and
clearly you were describing how the hawker was using the same water, cholera
would spread wildly but at the same time, these hawkers were meeting a
need, weren’t they?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>Yes, they were meeting a huge need. I think largely to provide affordable
food to many people. A lot of the immigrants were single males. They didn’t
have family in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They wouldn’t have agriculture, they wouldn’t be fishing. And they would
need to meet their sustenance needs outside. When you're working at the
docks, hawkers congregate around the breakfast, lunchtime period. And they
really sold cheap food for most of these labourers. In some sense, hawkers
were really fundamental in incentivising and encouraging that economy to
go along.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Because if you don’t have food, you’re not going to be able to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>Yeah. So, they were selling to the labourers, the clerks, the coolies
and they stood as a very important part of society back then.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay. And maybe can you tell us a little bit about why the colonial government
struggled to control them? I mean you couldn’t give them licences and get
the police to chase them?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>That’s what they did. A large part of it was getting the police to chase
hawkers around and outside of the areas that were very congested. I think
the administration had issues because they were not large enough, that’s
one. I think running the colonial ports and hawkers was not on their minds.
There wasn’t any legislation, actually. Hawkers were not registered, given
that they were informal. There was likely also a transient problem to some
extent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The municipal government outsourced the issue to the police. The first
legislation really only came about in 1907 and back then it only covered
night hawkers. Day hawkers would be running around and it wasn’t technically
illegal. That law only extended to day hawkers in 1919. There might not
have been a ton of colonial policemen running around. There’s estimated
about maybe around 20 to 30,000 hawkers back then. I don’t think they would
be efficient enough to administer any legislation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Things changed after independence?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>This hawker issue ran about for quite some time, even throughout World
War II and after post-World War II as well. But I think post-independence,
there was a huge push to reform Singapore. And alongside that reform came
hawkers as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think, economically, hawkers were very important because they represented
individuals that could be upskilled. The one hawker, one licence policy
exemplifies that you actually could not get a hawker licence if you were
below 40 years old. And so in the 1970s, if you went to the Ministry of
Environment then and said, “I want to be a hawker”, they would actually
turn you away and say, “Oh, let me refer you to MOM instead”. And you could
be upskilled and go into a productive industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>And what was the reason for that?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>I think the reason was that they wanted to keep hawking as a social need
only. So only perhaps if you could not be upskilled, only if you had some
social circumstance, then you could continue being a hawker. But I think
the government line was that there’s a lot of people in hawking and perhaps
they could be “repurposed” in some ways that could contribute to Singapore’s
economic boom then.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>But what enabled the government post-independence to succeed when the
colonial government could not?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>One was really bureaucratic strength and sophistication. I think the Lee
Kuan Yew government really saw the importance of having a strong bureaucracy.
And this came in the form of specific legislations that governed hawking
operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have, for example, the Environmental Protection Health Act 1969, or
the Sale of Food Act 1973, and that really set the guardrails and frameworks
of how hawking should have been conducted. Second is bureaucratic size.
The Hawkers Department was a department within the Ministry of Environment.
They grew the Hawkers Department by almost two to three times in enforcement
size. It was huge.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>I think within four to five years.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>That’s a sign that they were serious about enforcement.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>Yes. They were serious on enforcement and they were very serious about
policy and planning as well. You had specific divisions within the hawker
department looking at hawker centre policy and hawker policy, relocation
policy and it really showed the intentionality in trying to solve the hawker
problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>So there’s a focus in a way that perhaps there wasn’t there before to
solve this problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>Yes, there was a focus and there was will. And I think that was the changing
factor between pre-independence and post-independence.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay. Now I want to talk about hawker centres – and this goes back to
what you were saying from the beginning. So, hawker centres are actually
pretty unique to Singapore. You can go to a hawker centre and you can eat
in a relatively clean environment. It’s got a wide variety of food and
it’s not expensive. It’s pretty affordable and this is pretty unique.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>Yes. It is tremendously unique. I think nowhere else in the world you
have such, I think highly engineered infrastructure meant for hawkers and
I think Singapore did it at scale as well. I think the initial idea was
to move hawkers off the streets, to formalise them to some extent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think they knew that hawkers were very important to society. They provided
cheap food. It was also a vocation to undertake if they couldn’t fit into
productive society for different reasons. And hawker centres really help
to channel that and set guard rules for how hawkers could have been conducted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I think that was the original intention. And then, as public housing
came along, the hawker centre was built to serve public housing estates
as well. And now we’ve seen hawker centres become a culture as well. A
culture, but also an instrument of redistribution to some extent.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Really, what do you mean?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>For example, in Singapore, it is still quite astounding to get street
food at 2 to 3 Singapore dollars or maybe even like 1 to 2 US dollars.
And that is not a phenomenon that you can see in other developed countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is precisely [why] I think hawkers are very unique, because they’re
built on government land. It’s built by the government, run by the government,
and this allows them to annex some kind of rent control, and they pass
on to the customers eventually. For example, a lot of the legacy hawkers
that were relocated in the 1970s, they’re still paying the same rent, actually.
So some of the hawkers, now –&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh my goodness.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>– they’re paying maybe S$150, $200 per month. And that’s why some hawkers
can still sell the food at S$3 even in 2025, which is amazing and astounding.
I remember reading a report by the Ministry of Trade and Industry that
said that rent constitutes anywhere from 2 percent to 12 percent of a hawker’s
operation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the high end, rent is only 12 percent and in a land-scarce place like
Singapore, I think that is quite amazing. They’re trying to incentivise
the conditions for affordable food. And we see that happening quite effectively.
And that’s why, especially for the lower income in Singapore, these are
still very important circumstances and happenings and I think for most
Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>National University of Singapore did a study on hawker prices across Singapore,
different hawker centres, and they did find that actually in areas where
there are more rental estates, the price of hawker food is cheaper.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh, okay.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>What are the exact mechanisms? I think they didn’t really lay out but
it does seem to show that there is some dynamism with regards to the food
pricing. And it is a very important mechanism of ensuring, depressing the
cost of living in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>What was the first hawker centre in Singapore?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>If I’m not wrong, it’s Newton Centre. If I’m not wrong, but you have to
factcheck me on that.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>The hawkers in Newton actually came from town. Like from the Centre Point
area, Cuppage.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>Cuppage. Yes. I think it is worthwhile to distinguish between hawker centres
and hawker shelters.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay, that’s interesting. Talk about that.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>So, in the past, in the colonial government you had hawker shelters and
those were like&nbsp; more informal, and less tightly regulated hawker
centres. The difference is the hawker shelters could have been privately
run, some of them government run. But in terms of the operationalisation
of the shelter, it was mostly run by the hawkers themselves. Think about,
for example, the markets that you have in Penang or in Malacca. The area
outside the hawkers. I’d say the hawker stall is their territory. Because
it’s the hawkers’ table. So on and so forth.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Yeah.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>But hawker centres are very different because they have public tables
like the tables and chairs that are screwed in, and this really changes
the way people experience hawking both from the hawker’s point-of-view
and from the customer’s point-of-view. Now for hawker centres, I could
go in and I could sit on a public chair and I wouldn’t be touted at.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>I still remember seeing signs on tables that you can sit anywhere you
like or something like that. And I didn’t realise why that was significant.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>I think the government reclaimed a lot of the control, spatial control
at least. For example, in coffee shops in Malaysia, a lot of public spaces
that are actually owned by the government are used by the coffee shop owner.
Reclaiming that space was quite important. Reclaiming that control was
quite important as well. Both from a hygiene point-of-view and from an
urban discipline point-of-view as previously mentioned, but I think the
second unique thing about hawker centres is that they were intentionally
planned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They are meant to be a part of the wider public housing, the amenities
and estates. And that was not something the hawker shelters were; I think
hawker shelters were temporary shelters to co-locate hawkers. When you’re
planning a public housing estate they cater for hawker centres. The new
HDB estates, there’s always still a hawker centre there and it is very
intentional that we have cheap and affordable food in these public housing
areas.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>I think Singaporeans expect that. What’s actually interesting, however,
is that we have all these hawker stalls in Singapore where people travel
all over the world, not over the world, but sometimes from one end of Singapore
to queue up to buy that particular dish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And certain hawkers become famous, and you even have hawkers that get
Michelin stars and Michelin bibs or something like that. And so, on one
hand we have hawker stars, but on the other hand, we also have other phenomena
at work. So, hawkers, like your grandmother you said, were hawkers. And
then your dad helped out in a hawker stall but you’re not helping out at
your grandmother’s hawker stall selling Teochew fish porridge at the moment,
are you?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>No, no. Not anymore. I think they actually stopped selling hawker food
very early on, maybe when my dad was still in his mid-20s. But I, it speaks
to the idea of how hawking was a very attractive vocation to many people,
and I think for a lot of the older generation especially, they have seen
that transition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And for my dad [it] is still a core memory for him, when he was still
chasing my mom. Helping out at the hawker stall was very important to show
like, okay, I am very filial to this. To the ladies I’m very hardworking.
Yes, I will work for no pay as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think the way we experience hawkers is very different, obviously right?
I grew up in a place where there were mostly hawker centres. There weren’t
a lot of street hawkers. Well, there were still a few street hawkers back
then. Those that sold roasted chestnuts in the streets. Sometimes I still
see them, one or two.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Not very often, but you still see them around.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>But yes, I think people in Singapore do travel a lot. I mean, people all
over the world do travel to Singapore to experience street food. And that
idea of tourism is a very interesting and recent phenomenon actually, because
if you think about the principle of building the hawker centre, it was
meant to service the neighborhood it was in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But now with this idea, maybe Singapore is a little bit smaller as well.
It’s almost like a hobby that people [do]. Actually, it’s an industry in
general. You have the CEO Good Food Books award, and people go around giving
a recognition to hawkers. You give reviews online, you get social media
coverage and I think this contributes to the idea of culture and that is
something uniquely Singaporean. And I think it is fascinating. It’s amazing.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>A bunch of things are happening, though. You have the hawkers with them,
the old-timey hawkers who have this amazing dish. But then their kids don’t
want to take over because they’ve seen their parents work 16 hours a day
and they don’t want to do the same thing. Or their parents tell them, no,
please don’t work so hard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go be a doctor or a lawyer? And then but at the same time, you have younger
people coming in. Also some of these old hawker stalls are really dying.
But at the same time, what’s really interesting to me is that in some hawker
centres, you can see gentrification.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>Yes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>So, you can see people selling baked goods that would not look out of
place in a patisserie, for example, or espresso coffee like the Beach Road
hawker centre. Bedok marketplace, which used to be a hawker centre above
a market. But it was taken over by a private company, and the whole place
has been turned around so that what looks ostensibly like a hawker centre,
but it’s much more upmarket. You can get foie gras, you can get handmade
pizzas. To me, that’s that ferment of the change that we’re seeing in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>That is a very astute observation and it’s completely true. Fundamentally,
the way I see it is that the food of individuals is a representation of
their identities. And this can be generational and fully an expression
of perhaps a polity at a particular time, and as Singaporean[s] grew more
cosmopolitan, a little bit more modern, a little bit less attached to the
traditional roots. I think it is quite natural to see them sell different
stuff in hawker centres. I think one good example is this place called
Black Goat.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay. I’ve heard of it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>I think it’s at Jalan Batu hawker centre. And I think the chef previously
worked in a few restaurants and he set up this hawker centre selling Western
food, steak and different meat cuts, and he only opens on weekends and
only for a few hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So he really challenges the idea that you have to work 16-hour work days
as a hawker. But he does find his value proposition. And I think people
really enjoy that too. And I think that’s actually a great microcosm of
how Singaporeans are evolving and how food, as an extension of that, is
evolving as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More traditional hawker recipes are retiring alongside the hawkers and
I think that’s an unfortunate kind of phase. Singapore moves into a different
generation. There are still some individuals who continue and they’ll pick
up the reins from their parents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that’s why it is actually so interesting when, let’s say a 30-year-old
teacher quits and takes over his parents’ stall. I think in some sense
the interesting thing is that the motivation for hawking has changed. In
the past I would go into hawking because it is a vocation of necessity.
But now I think a lot of Singaporeans are going to hawking because it’s
a vocation of choice. I choose to work long hours to preserve my family’s
heritage. For those that maybe don’t have such a long lineage of culinary
expertise, they can sell something else. You have interesting things like
the Golden Mile Espresso hawker who makes espresso using robusta beans.
I think it’s quite unique and I would say almost, it’s very Singaporean.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>No, I mean one of the wonderful things about hawker centres, I think,
is [that it’s] always surprising. And there’s always something interesting.
And so when I retire, my wife and I plan to go around Singapore to every
hawker centre, look online to see which foods we have to eat here and make
our way through every hawker centre in Singapore. I think it may not be
good for my heart, but it’ll be a useful way to spend my retirement years.
Let me ask you, tell us how this book came about?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>The book actually came about first as an independent research project.
I think back then, I was quite amazed. I think it was shortly after we
got the UNESCO awards in 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh, okay.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>I think as an individual, I was quite amazed about why Singapore, I mean
this hawker food would get this UNESCO nomination over let’s say the other
street food heavyweights like Malaysia and Thailand. Because I think as
a Singaporean, you do conceive of it quite similarly. I think they are
all street food. Thai food is equally as good as Malaysian.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Malaysian street food is better.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>In some respect it is better, and I think I was very interested in finding
out why Singaporean food, why only Singapore hawker culture got this UNESCO
award. So I started researching. I spoke to the individual who nominated
the UNESCO award, which was Mr Yeoh Kok Siang from the National Heritage
Board.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And he shared that it wasn’t really so much so about the food per se,
but about the space that hosts his food at the hawker centre itself. And
the hawker centre creates these conditions for these organic interactions.
And after a while it became a culture and within the nomination form, it
was all about the hawker centre and the culture that comes out of the hawker
centre.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>So not the food, but the centre.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>The centre, correct. I turned this into my final year capstone at Yale-NUS
College and went down a deep rabbit hole. I think I did a way longer thesis
than I should have. And at the end of it, my supervisor Professor Tan Tai
Yong said that this was tremendous research and I should try and do something
with it. And that’s what I did. And I’ve never looked back after that.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay. I mean, it’s very interesting. The thing with hawker centres and
hawker food is that it’s such a beloved institution that’s been studied
before. So, what new things do you bring to that?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>Dr Lai Chee Kian and Professor Lily Kong’s books were tremendous influences.
As a politics, philosophy and history major, I really want to situate the
development of hawking and hawker culture alongside Singapore’s own history.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think a lot of the previous books talked about hawker centres as an
infrastructure itself and the infrastructure history behind it. But I wanted
to understand the wider motivations or macroeconomic drivers that encouraged
hawking in Singapore and more specifically, hawker centres. And why did
the government think of creating this specifically highly engineered building?&nbsp;</p>
<p>And why don’t other countries think of it? And secondly, to try and challenge
the colonial narrative of hawker[s]. I think as Singapore grows a little
bit more independent, actually 60 this year, I think we do have some space
to grow that.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>And last but not least, you look at its contemporary relevance. And specifically
what are the economic drivers, what are the sociological nuggets that we
can find from the hawker centre itself? I think one very brief example
is how hawker centres are very important spaces for politics.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh what do you mean? I did not know this.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>For example, your MPs. Your MPs will go to hawker centres and they are
very intentional in being seen because I think most people wouldn’t wear
shirt [and] pants to hawker centres. So they’re there to be seen to hear
the feedback on the ground, but also to challenge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take a case, for example, like when the Progressive Party went to a new
hawker centre, Taman Jurong. I think it was the first foray into a new
GRC and I think the hawker centre was the first place that they went. And
I was actually there. I didn’t know they were going there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was having my meal and I saw a lot of people were over there and I asked
and they said it’s actually their first time in this place, and I thought
that’s fascinating. Another example is how President Tharman celebrated,
I think his win at the Taman Jurong hawker centre, at the same hawker centre.
So I think it points to how such a place of conviviality is such an important
social space where everyone gathers and I think there is so much more left
to be studied about hawker centres and the sociology of hawker centres.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>And yeah, I hope to focus on that in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay, let’s talk about it. Now you are no longer an academic, tell us
about what you’re doing now.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>Now I’m actually a Strategic Consultant with Bain &amp; Company. We work
on management consulting and strategic consulting. I am still trying to
find time to write. I think it is a bit challenging with the consultant
life but I’m still writing a few pieces for the Singapore Chinese Cultural
Centre.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Is it related to food?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>It is related to food. Related to the evolution of Teochew food from China
and how Singaporean Teochew food is different from Chinese Teochew food.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>I’m also writing a few pieces for the National Heritage Board. There’s
some engagement [for the] Singapore Heritage Festival in May, preparing
for that as well. I think I try to balance my professional life and my
foodie life. I do hope to read, research more and write more about food
and hawker culture.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>You are the ideal person to do it because your surname is Kueh and actually,
it’s not a very common name, is it? Last name, Kueh?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>I think it’s not a common anglicised name. In Chinese it’s Guo and traditional[ly]
anglicised as Quek, but I think Guo is usually from individuals who are
of Hokkien descent, but I’m of Teochew descent. I think they pronounce
it as Kueh and it got lost in translation along the way.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Are there many Kuehs in Singapore? I mean, walking Kueh, not the one that
we eat.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>There are many Kuehs in Singapore that are walking Kuehs and I think I
have come across a few online, but I haven’t seen others outside of my
family. So, it’s almost like bird spotting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I’ve been interested in this before and I’ve looked online and there
are quite a few Kueh in Malaysia. What the relationship is, I’m not too
sure, but hopefully I can pull that string sometime in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay, cool. So, having done all this research, what did the research involve?
Do you speak to hawkers? Did you do research in the library?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>I think most of it was primary and secondary research. I spoke to a few
professors but I think the bulk of it was time at the National Library
and National Archives.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay. What were you looking at? There’s not a lot of food, I have to tell
everyone, on the shelves of the National Library and the National Archives.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>I was looking at primary sources of all the different hawker commission
reports, how the colonial governments reported them. I think it’s very
specifically a core memory for me actually, to go to the 11th floor of
the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library, and there’s a small little room in
the middle of the 11th floor.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh, that’s right, the glass room.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>And you can read the different primary sources that are both public and
non-public. For example, I was reading a 1950s Commission report. I never
thought I would see it in person.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ve seen it referenced and through my time with the National Archives,
researching at National archives. It’s usually digitised but it was fascinating
to see an actual manuscript in person and to see how people read and thought
of it, and so a lot of that time was spent doing primary research.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I think I always lose track of time when I’m doing that and I think
it’s truly fascinating.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Did the research involve going to very many hawker centres around Singapore?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>Not too much, I think at the end of the day, this was still a book about
the history of hawker centres. If I ever do publish a next book or research
a next book, it’ll be more about the contemporary relevance and I think
there will be a lot more primary research involving hawker centre visiting.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Which is not too bad of a thing to do.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>It’s a fantastic thing to do.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Despite that, you must have a favourite hawker centre. What is your favourite
hawker centre?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>My favourite hawker centre is Taman Jurong.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay. Which you were saying, you live nearby.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>I live nearby. I actually didn’t use to live in Jurong. I used to live
in Woodlands and my childhood favourite hawker centre is Chong Pang because
that’s where my mum grew up. My grandmother, who grew up in the Yishun
area in Chong Pang, has a lot of nostalgia for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I think now Taman Jurong, simply because it was, as I delve more into
hawker culture, I realise Taman Jurong was actually one of the first few
multi-storey hawker centres. It’s actually three storeys. It contains both
very old traditional hawkers and also new hawkers and it’s always bustling,
like I said, there’s always political activity. I think it’s fun to watch.
And I think the design is very neat because there’s an alfresco area and
it’s also like a sheltered area.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh, there’s an alfresco area.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>It’s a bit like the old umbrellas.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Yeah. Oh, they still have them?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>They still have them, and it’s tremendously fantastic.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Complete the sentence “Hawking is...?”</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>Hawking is a representation of our past, present and future.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Really, our future, in what way?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>Hawking is dynamic and as Singaporeans change, so will hawking. Given
how much interesting stuff Singaporeans are coming up with now in hawker
centres, I’m sure it’ll be a yummy, yummy future.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Do you ever see yourself being a hawker?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>Well, I’ve thought about it many times. Many times when I’m at work...&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>I mean, that’s your grandmother’s fish, what fish soup? Teochew fish soup.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>I myself do not cook a good enough fish soup as comparable.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>
<br>But perhaps sometime in the future, I think being a hawker would be quite
interesting. I mean, maybe a retirement job, maybe.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Maybe a retirement job. Okay, Ryan, I want to thank you for coming on
the show. If you want to read Ryan’s book <em>From Streets to Stalls</em>,
