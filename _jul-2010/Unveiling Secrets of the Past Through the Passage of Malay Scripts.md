#### Teaching Fellow _Mohamed Pitchay Gani Bin Mohamed Abdul Aziz_ explores the heritage of the rich Malay civilisation through its enchanting and spellbinding _aksara_, or scripts.

*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“They neither built pyramids of copper,<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Nor tombstones of bronze for themselves \[…\],<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But they left their heritage in their writings,<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In the exhortations that they composed.”*<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;From the ancient Egyptian ‘Praise to the scribes’ 1

#### **Introduction**

Early civilisations have left behind vestiges of their existence such as artefacts and monuments that glorify their achievements and accomplishments. Their scripts especially allow modern researchers to peer into the soul of their civilisations. Tham2 deduced that there are interplays between language and culture, and between culture and the environment, with regards to the Malay language and its scripts. Such synergies can be observed in the journey of the Malay manuscript from its earliest form to its modern day script. Consequently the interaction culminates with the oldest Malay script in the world, the oldest manuscript in Southeast Asia, and, more importantly resurrecting new insights on ancient stone inscriptions.

The Tarumanegara Stone in west Java is believed to bear the oldest known Malay script dating as far back as AD 400. Such stone inscription artefacts are widely found in and about the Indonesian islands of Sumatra: Kota Kapur in west Bangka (686), Karang Brahi between Jambi and Sungai Musi (686), Kedukan Bukit in south Sumatera (683) and Talang Tuwo in south Sumatra (684).

Forming part of the Austronesian language family, which includes Polynesian and Melanesian languages, Malay is widely used in the Malay Archipelago among about 300 million speakers in Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei and Singapore as well as a diaspora in Thailand and other parts of Southeast Asia, Asia, East Timor and the Malay people of Australia’s Cocos Keeling Islands in the Indian Ocean. It is understood in parts of the Sulu area of the southern Philippines and traces of it are to be found among people of Malay descent in Sri Lanka, South Africa and other places.

#### **Unlocking the Secrets**

Unlocking secrets of the past through critical interpretation of artefacts related to the Malay world is the thrust of the book *Aksara: Menjejaki Tulisan Melayu* (*Aksara: The Passage of Malay Scripts*) published by the National Library Board, Singapore, in 2009.3 Edited by Juffri Supa’at and Nazeerah Gopaul, this book (Aksara4 ) traces the development of the Malay language from its earliest known source in AD 2 to the present. The evidence is captured in the form of manuscripts, books, magazines and newspapers. This coffee table book is divided into four parts: (i) the history and development of the Malay language,(ii) the coming of Islam, (iii) colonial encounters, and (iv) Singapore and modern writing. Each part is developed with a research paper on the subject and pictures of related artefacts. While this compilation may not be comprehensive, it is a valuable addition that forms an outstanding collection of bibliographical reference. The book documents the Malay heritage in the Archipelago and contributes to the effort of generating more discussions and research into the world of the Malay language, literature, scripts and publications.
