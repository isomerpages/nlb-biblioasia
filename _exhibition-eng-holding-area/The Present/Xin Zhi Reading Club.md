**About**:	Xin Zhi Reading Club is a non-political, non-religious, and non-profit cultural organisation committed to fostering intellectual and cultural development within the community. Our mission centres on building a society characterised by comprehensive growth in virtue, education, and wisdom, whilst enhancing humanistic literacy and promoting the rich heritage of Chinese culture. Through our programmes and activities, we strive to cultivate well-rounded individuals who embody moral integrity, pursue lifelong learning, and appreciate the depth of cultural traditions. By nurturing these qualities, we aim to contribute to a more enlightened and culturally aware society that values both personal development and collective wisdom.
