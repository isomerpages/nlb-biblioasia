#### **Introduction**
On 29 May 2016, the Javanese Association of Singapore (JAS) conducted
the opening ceremony of the exhibition *Pusåkå* held at the Malay Heritage
Centre. Posing for group photos in front of a Malay-style building on a
typical day in Singapore were people dressed in full Javanese attire – women
in *kebaya* (traditional blouse-dress) with *batik* sarong, and men in *blangkon*
headdress complete with *kris* (a dagger with a wavy-edged blade). *Pusåkå*,
meaning heirloom or legacy in Javanese, showcased the heritage and
cultural history of the Javanese who settled in Singapore, as well as the ways
in which they nurtured their Javanese identity. *Pusåkå* featured a diverse
range of artefacts and everyday objects including a number of Javanese
family heirlooms passed down from one generation to the next. During
the exhibition’s opening speech, as reported by *The Straits Times*, Malay
Heritage Centre curator Suhaili Osman said that *Pusåkå* was an excellent
example of how we live and breathe heritage in our daily lives
sometimes without realising it (Kao, 2016).

Besides *Pusåkå*, seminar sessions were also organised, including a special
discussion on the roots journey conducted by Singaporean-Javanese Nori
Norindah Joyhana Ahmad, author of *The Roots of My Ancient Journey*. Nori’s
self-published book recounts a Singaporean-Javanese’s journey of self-discovery
and her experience on reconnecting with her Javanese ancestral
roots. After experiencing this journey, Nori began to nurture her Javanese
identity more seriously.

The roots journey is a massive phenomenon experienced by Singaporean-
Javanese living in the diasporic condition. These Singaporean-Javanese are
often interested in the romanticism of Javanese history and journeying to Java, Indonesia in search of their roots. They trace their ancestry in Java
according to oral history or historical documents that have been and are
still handed down through generations. By going on a roots journey to Java,
they can cultivate more historical stories about Singapore from the Javanese
perspective. For many of them, this journey represents how they can
nurture their ancestral heritage and cultivate their identities as Javanese. This
phenomenon is intertwined with the history of the Javanese in Singapore
when Tumasik (Singapore’s ancient name) was one of the vassals of the
Javanese-Majapahit empire, as recorded in 14th century Javanese annals
*Nagarakrtagama* and *Pararaton* (Kriswanto, 2009:106; Riana, 2009:99). This
has also been supported by archeological evidence1 of jewellery typical of the
Javanese-Majapahit kingdom unearthed around Bukit Larangan (present-day
Fort Can ning in Singapore) (Kwa, Heng and Tan, 2009:14; Miksic and Gek, 2004:17). This begets the question of how Singaporean-Javanese can
nurture Javanese cultural heritage in their daily lives in Singapore, and how
this would in turn encourage them to go on a roots journey to Java.

In the 2010 census of Singapore, 88,646 Singaporeans identified themselves
as “Javanese” (Singapore Department of Statistics, 2010:46). However, many
Singaporeans are still unaware of the history of the Javanese in Singapore.
The Javanese have been present in Singapore since the Majapahit empire,
when Singapore (then known as Tumasik) had been its vassal according
to the royal court poem of *Nagarakrtagama* written in 1365 (Anshory and
Arbaningsih, 2008:84; Purwadi, 2005:12; Poesponegoro and Notosusanto,
1992:92; Robson, 1995:35). Javanese mass migration continued after the
arrival of the British in the early 19th century. In short, there have been four
main phases of Javanese migration in Singapore: the Nusantara ancient era
of Tumasik, the British colonial era, the Japanese Occupation era and the
modern era of Singapore.

As such, it might be surprising to some that there is little literature
examining the Javanese in Singapore, and what exists are student theses,
such as: “The Javanese of Singapore” by Abdul Aziz bin Johari (University
of Malaya, 1961), “The Baweanese and the Javanese in Singapore: A
Comparative Analysis of Integration in a Plural Sociology by Juliana
Khusaini (National University of Singapore, 1989) and “A History of
the Javanese and Boyanese in Singapore” by Hwee Hwee Jeanette Chia
(National University of Singapore, 1992). Despite the existence of such
theses, there are no published books on the subject. Moreover, little has
been said about the contemporary movement in the form of the roots
journey undertaken by Singaporean-Javanese. This study thus seeks to
bridge the gap in Singapore’s knowledge about the Javanese in Singapore.

Ethnohistory combines the approaches of history, philology, cultural
anthropology and archaeology (Calloway, 1983:97; Carmack, 1972:230;
Chavez, 2008:487; Gadacz, 1982:148). Ethnohistory, in short, is based on
historical documents, but are written with anthropological insight (Harkon,
2010:113; Sluis and Edwards, 2013:72, Wood, 1990:81). By combining
historical and ethnographic approaches according to Fontana (1961:10), this
ethnohistorical study will examine historical data through empirical facts
in the field. The historical explanation in this paper can be positioned as an
integral part of understanding the dynamic picture of the development of
the Javanese in Singapore.

In the case of diasporas, the romantic memory of ancestors is the main pillar
of nurturing a distinctive identity and strengthening the diaspora’s sense of
belonging to their ancestral homeland. In the context of the Singaporean-
Javanese, the Javanese identity is built upon two main elements: the
history of the Javanese in Singapore and the way Javanese culture has been
assimilated into the Malay culture in Singapore. Nurturing the Javanese
identity in Singapore, which is “unique” compared to being Javanese in
Java, compels the Singaporean-Javanese go on a roots journey to Java,
motivated not only by the desire to trace their roots but also to reminisce
about Java’s history in Tumasik in the context of Singapore.

Crafted from something new and rereading existing historical sources,
this study attempts to present an alternative perspective of the Javanese in
Singapore and examine how the roots journey is nurtured by analysing two
aspects: identity and history. This paper is centred around these two aspects,
explaining history and identity as integral parts of understanding the roots
journey undertaken by the Singaporean-Javanese diaspora.

#### **Navigating Diaspora and the Notion of Homeland**

In many studies, diaspora is linked to the notion of homeland (see e.g. Basu,
2007; Clifford, 1994; Cohen, 2008; Falzon, 2003; Knoot and McLoughlin,
2010; Levy and Weingrod, 2005; Morawska, 2011; Rozen, 2008; Sheffer,
2010; Tololyan, 2007). Levy and Weingrod (2005:3) reveal that home in
this context is much more than a physical structure (a house), but also an
imagined place with a set of feelings and imaginative realms. Home is a
process of creating and understanding forms of living and belonging. This
means home can evoke a sense of belonging, a memory of the past and
variable emotions. As a result, links with the ancestral homeland are often
decorative and deeply embedded in memories of diasporic people (Clifford,
1994:304). Falzon (2003:664) states that homeland is generally understood as
a sacred place filled with forms of longing and memory, either about culture
or ancestors, and diasporic people dislocated from their homeland will
maintain their imagined-homeland “by making a new home” while living in
their host countries. According to Tölölyan (2007:649), the continuation of
home-maintaining can be performed by commemorating and reconstructing
a collective identity that preserves elements of the homeland’s language,
religion, social practice and cultural heritage.

In this study, the ethnographic data shows that the historical explanation
of the Javanese in Singapore since the 12th to 14th centuries (according to
archaeological remains found in Singapore) is part of the foundation of
nurturing Javanese identity and maintaining links with their homeland
by means of cultural preservation. Subjects we interviewed affirmed the
importance of this to them:

   united Nusantara by means of Palapa expedition) was here…”*<br><br><br>

Many Singaporean-Javanese share Sri’s (a third generation Singaporean-
Javanese) sentiment – the romanticism of the ancient history of the Javanese
in Tumasik is a part of respecting their ancestors and understanding the
lineage of Javanese migration to Singapore to the present day. From that
story, it can be inferred that the oral tradition is the foremost method in
transmitting stories of one’s roots in human culture. Supporting this idea
is existing literature that states that remembering ancestors is a basic part
of human culture (Fairley, 2003; Geana, 2005; Levitt, 2010; Schenider,
2008;, Schraam, 2010). Generally, tales about one’s ancestors are passed
down through the generations through storytelling, at least within families.
Among the Singaporean-Javanese, there are several stories that are recalled
and shared, such as the story of Javanese Singhasari-Majapahit kingdoms
in Tumasik, the story of ancestral migration during Islamic Hajj during
the colonial era, the story of being Javanese and Malay, and the story of
reconnecting with one’s roots.

According to Geana (2005:349), one of the most ancient and elaborate
cultural acts is the devotion of the ancestral cult by remembering and also
worshipping the deceased, the so-called memorialisation of ancestors that
answers a fundamental need of humans – the need to remember. This can
be done by recalling a story of origins that employs genealogies of human
history (Schraam, 2010:23). According to Schenider (2008:2), telling stories
is how people construct meaning from memory, but the process is selective and many factors influence which stories are told. Repeating stories of and
about ancestors, or so-called *Ngeling-eling* in the Javanese language, is one
of the pillars of Javanese culture. Repeating ancestral stories is also linked to
a search for selfhood for diasporic people. *Ngeling-ngeling* can be deduced
as a part of cultivating Javanese identity and maintaining Javanese heritage.
This can be done by several modes: retelling stories of one’s roots, as well as
cultivating and finding one’s roots.

This is in line with the wise Javanese saying: “Javanese people without
the knowledge of their past history is [sic] like a tree without roots, *koyo
kacang lali kulite* (such as a peanut forgetting its nutshell)”. This is what
Arora and Sanos (2011:91) call the melancholia of diaspora, where the
diasporic imagination is filled with stories of loss, past memories and
recalling history. In the case of Singaporean-Javanese diaspora, recalling
a story of ancestors can be done by referring to the archeological
evidence found at Bukit Larangan that shows the Javanese Singhasari-
Majapahit civilisation in Tumasik as well as modern migration during
the colonial era.

In fact, the archaeological evidence comprising Javanese-Majapahit
jewellery, unearthed during excavations in Bukit Larangan between
1926 and 1928, indicates that Javanese civilisations existed in Singapore
since the 14th century (Anne and Lim, 2017:4; Bastin, 1994:5 Kwa, Heng
and Tan, 2009:14; Miksic and Gek, 2004:17; Turnbull, 1989:19; Yeo,
2017:24). According to a verse in *Nagarakrtagama*2 written in Kawi, an
ancient Javanese language (Riana, 2009:99),3 Tumasik was a vassal of the
Javanese-Majapahit kingdom (Robson, 1995:2).

In line with *Nagarakrtagama*, Singapore is also mentioned in the
majestic pledge4 of Gadjah Mada during his inauguration as Majapahit
Amangkubhumi (prime minister) in 1336 CE (Hazra, 2007:40). In addition,
in 1275 CE (prior to the Majapahit period), Kertanegara from the Singhasari
kingdom invaded Malayu under the Pamalayu expedition as narrated in
*Pararaton* and *Nagarakertagama* after Kertanegara’s great victory in attacking
Jambi and Palembang (Adji and Achmad, 2013:94; Barwise and White,
2012:69; Blagden, 1909:23; Hall, 1960:67; Munoz, 2006:262; Ricklefs,
2001:22; Rouffaer and Winstedt, 1922:56). The Pamalayu expedition in 1187
caka, or 1275 CE, is also mentioned in the texts *Pararaton*, *Kidung Panji
Wijayakrama*, *Kidung Harsawijaya* and *Nagarakrtagama pupuh 41* (Muljana,
2011:112-113).

Written historical records depicting the Javanese civilisation in Singapore
after the decline of Majapahit are scarce.5 Singapore was subsequently
governed under the reign of the Johore-Riau-Lingga Sultanate (Rahim,
2006:521).6 When Raffles arrived in Singapore, there were already
indigenous people, including Malays living in *kampongs* (villages) and
Orang Laut (sea gypsies comprising the Orang Kallang, Orang Seletar/
Slitar, Orang Selat and Orang Gelam), living around the mouth of the Singapore River, Kallang River, Telok Blangah and along the Johor Straits
(Diagana and Angresh, 2013:21).

The story of the Javanese in Tumasik can be considered as the pride of
Singaporean-Javanese in modern Singapore, representing the spirit of
exploration of the Javanese in modern Singapore. The story of the
Javanese during the Majapahit and Singhasari eras in Tumasik also
underscores the importance of commemorating *simbah* (literally
translated as ancestors in Javanese) as part of nurturing ancestral
roots and cultivating Javanese identity.
