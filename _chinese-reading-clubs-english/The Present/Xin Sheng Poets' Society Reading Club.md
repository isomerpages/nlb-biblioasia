**About**:	Xin Sheng Poets' Society is dedicated to the scholarly study of Chinese poetry and the promotion of literary elegance within the community. Our programme is held on the first four Sunday afternoons of each month, during which two experienced instructors provide guidance and explanation of classical poetry for members and other students who love Chinese poetry. We aim to cultivate learnersâ€™ enthusiasm, appreciate and promote traditional poetry, and improve their writing skills.
