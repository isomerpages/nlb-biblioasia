**Belacan: Caviar or Vile?**<br>
Even Munshi Abdullah wasn’t a fan of _belacan._ He referred to it as <i>makanan yang busuk-busuk</i> (smelly food). During the 19th century, people were fined for illegally storing _belacan_ in the city. Toffa Abdul Wahed sniffs out the condiment’s long history. </p><p>
