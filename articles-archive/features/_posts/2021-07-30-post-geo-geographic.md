"You can render space and suspend time." So writes American author Ronlyn Domingue of the powers of the map-maker, or cartographer, in her fantasy novel The Mapmaker's Wad.

The act of graphically representing the world around us is an early human impulse -judging from the prehistoric engravings of landscapes found in caves and rock shelters.<sup>2</sup> Perhaps the earliest surviving example of a world map is a 2,600-year-old clay tablet<sup> 3</sup> dating to around 600 BCE, representing a Babylonian's view of the world. Some might debate that the tablet cannot be considered a map as it is neither drawn to scale nor does it accurately capture the geographical landscape - for example, the river Euphrates is drawn as a set of parallel lines. From a scientific perspective, this clay tablet would certainly not qualify as a map. What, then, constitutes a map?

According to J.B. Harley and David Woodward, editors of a multi-volume series <i>History of Cartography</i> first published in 1987, "maps are graphic representations that facilitate a spatial understanding of things, concepts, conditions, processes, or events in the human world. "<sup>4</sup> Most scholars who study maps have come to accept this definition of a map. This inclusive definition challenges the generally accepted view of maps as utilitarian, geographical and scientific, and its evolution as a move towards objective "truth". It opens up the discourse on maps as objects that combine both the visual and the textual, as shaped by their makers. Maps need not depict places that are found on our physical earth, such as cosmological maps of paradise and other worlds, nor do they have to be tangible in the way the maps in our smart phones are.

All maps are, in a sense, mental maps as they reflect not only the cultural and historical backgrounds but also the personal perspectives of their makers. This is because maps are simplified representations of space within which map-makers have to decide what details to include or exclude. Maps that claim to provide "accurate descriptions" of a place may be overstating their assertion.<sup>5</sup> Aside from reflecting the worldview of the map-maker, maps can be used to reinforce accepted values and power structures. 

Maps, atlases and globes are often used metaphorically to represent power (real or imagined) and domination over territories. For instance, Queen Elizabeth I has been depicted in a portrait standing on the map of the British Isles,<sup>6</sup> and in other paintings with her hand poised over a globe. In ancient China,the handing over of maps by the defeated state was a sign of submission to the victor,<sup>7</sup> and 17th-century Mughal emperor, Jahangir, was depicted in portraits as standing atop a terrestrial globe.<sup>8</sup>

Maps have a special significance in Singapore. Given the dearth of historical material on Singapore before the arrival of Stamford Raffles in 1819, pre-19th-century maps depicting the island act as important visual records of our early origins. The National Library's latest exhibition, "Land of Gold and Spices: Early Maps of Southeast Asia and Singapore", provides visitors with the unique opportunity to view these rare early maps. This exhibition is part of a larger festival of maps and mapping called "Geo|Graphic: Celebrating Maps and Their Stories" 

"Geo|Graphic", which is a curated combination of exhibitions and programmes, explores the diverse world of maps and showcases the collections of the National Library (NL) and the National Archives of Singapore (NAS), as well as mapping-related artworks by four Singapore artists.

This map is from <i>Itinerarium Sacrae Scripturae (Itinerary of Holy Scripture)</i>, written by the 16th-century pastor and theologian, Heinrich Bunting. The map shows the continent of Asia as Pegasus, the winged horse in Greek mythology. The book, which features the Bible written in the form of a travel account, was first published in 1581. Another map in the book depicts the world in the shape of a three-leaf clover with the scared city of Jerusalem in the centre and with Asia, Europe and Africa as leaves.<br><i>National Library of Singapore Collection.</i>

Some early maps Of the region drawn by Europeans are believed to have been based on indigenous maps and sources. In turn, indigenous cartographic traditions were also influenced by European maps of the time. This nautical chart, believed to a pirate's map, shows heavy borrowings from Dutch maps. <i>Courtesy of Univeristy of Utrecht Library.</i>


#### **LAND OF GOLD AND SPICES: EARLY MAPS OF SOUTHEAST ASIA AND SINGAPORE**
This anchor exhibition for "Geo|Graphic" reveals how Southeast Asia was perceived, conceived and mapped by the Europeans from the 15th to the early 19th century. The exhibition starts off with maps based on Geography, the seminal work of the 2nd- century Greek astronomer and mathematician Claudius Ptolemy. Ptolemy plotted out what he considered as the known terrestrial world at the time. The region we now know as Southeast Asia was for Ptolemy "India Beyond the Ganges" - a land where gold, silver and other exotic products abounded In 13th-century Europe, the tables of longitudes and latitudes from Geography were translated into maps to accompany the text, first in manuscript form and, later, in the 15th century, in printed editions. These maps constitute some of the earliest European depictions of Southeast Asia. Eventually, the lure of spices and riches brought the Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch and British to the region and their intrepid journeys can be explored through the various maps displayed at the exhibition.
	
A highlight of the exhibition are several pre-1800 maps that contain names such as Cinca pula, Cingatola and Sincapura. Could these names refer to Singapore? Also on display are early printed and hand-drawn maps that identify Singapore as Old Strieghts of Sincapura, lantana, Pulo Panjang and Sincapour. Whatever the names used, these maps clearly point to Singapore's existence before 1819 and offer a glimpse into its maritime history. Another highlight are the rare hand-drawn Dutch and English maps that have been borrowed from European libraries and displayed in Singapore for the first time.

(Left) The Dutch merchant/traveller and historian, Jan Huygen van Linschoten (1563-1611) is credited with writing a book on the navigational routes to the elusive East Indies (referring generally to India and Southeast Asia). The Portuguese, who at that time controlled the lucrative spice trade to Europe, kept such information secret. Sailing directions and accurate maps from Linschoten's book <i>Itinerario</i> (first published in 1596), later paved the way for the Dutch and British to venture to the region. This cropped detail Of a larger map from the English edition of the <i>Itinerario</i>, published in 1598, shows "Sincapura" at the tip of the Malay Peninsula. Interestingly, Linschoten's map is oriented with the east at the top. with the entire region positioned on its side. National Library ofSingapore Collection.
