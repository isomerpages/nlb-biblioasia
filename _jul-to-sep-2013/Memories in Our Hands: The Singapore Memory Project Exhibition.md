#### Memories and history are viewed differently. Find out how the Singapore Memory Project captures such memories and provide us with another way of looking at Singapore aside from linear historicity.

Without our memories, we would not be able to perform the simplest everyday task, create meaning in our lives, or construct our sense of identity—our identities are anchored to what we choose to remember of ourselves. While memories are personal and internal, derived from an individual’s experiences in life, our memories are also cultural, drawing from and shaped by our social and cultural circumstances.1 Just like an individual, a group without memories would not know how to distinguish itself from others, nor understand what it stands for, or its values.


Memories are often viewed differently from history. History, being the purview of academics, is thought of as guided by reason and therefore, objective. Historians rely mainly on information in documents and objects, allowing history to be verified. In contrast, memories are personal and considered as an authentic voice — since the person who remembers experienced an event first hand. Memories are associated with emotions, subject to revision and forgetting is often part of the process of memory formation. The distinction between history and memory is, however, not so clear. Historians, after all, rely on materials or sources that are often memories of others. How history has been conceived or written is also shaped by the historian’s perspectives, which are in turn formed by his or her memories. What both memory and history have in common is that they are both representations of the past interpreted through the filter of the present.

The growing interest around the world on memories, whether in the form of family histories, autobiographies or memorials, has been for some scholars the result of what is termed the “memory-crisis”2—“a crisis involving on the one hand, enormous attention to memory, and on the other, disjuncture between contemporary life and the remembered past”.3 The anxieties of a fast-changing world make us “speak so much of memory because there is so little of it left”.4

Knowledge and remembering \[are\] in the hands and in the body.

Where are memories kept? Memory by its nature is “mortal, linked to the brain and the body that bears it”.5 There are, however, memory warehouses in the form of libraries, archives and museums where memories are kept in material forms. The Singapore Memory Project (smp) is one such warehouse. Launched in August 2011, it is a nationwide initiative spearheaded by the National Library to capture the memories of Singapore —whether individual, organisational or collective. Memories are authentic voices enriching the telling of the past and providing another way of looking at Singapore aside from linear historicity.

This year, aside from collecting, preserving and presenting memories on its digital platform, the SMP team is working on a physical exhibition called “Hands”. Unlike historical exhibitions that are often curated from the viewpoint of historians, memories will take centre stage in this exhibition.

“*I started in 1936 when I joined the post office. At that time, Singapore was under the Postmaster General based at the headquarters in Kuala Lumpur. During the Japanese Occupation, there was no foreign mail service, only internal mail service or to Malaysia. The mail to Malaysia was censored. We had nothing to do with the censorship. The censorship was carried out by the Japanese officers. The savings bank service was continued and we continued to withdraw money from the post office savings bank but we were paid in Japanese Yen*."
	
“*When we became separated \[from Malaya\], we had new problems. The new problems for instance, the Housing Boards \[flats\] were coming up and a lot of correspondence was delivered. And postmen found it very difficult to go and deliver*."
	
“*So there was talk about having boxes in the flats and for that we had a lot of problems. The National Development Board was rather reluctant to establish post office boxes, because they occupied space that could make them money*."
	
“*A new legislation was introduced that every household must have a postbox so that we postmen can deliver, and all the offices, the big buildings must have boxes for us postmen to deliver*."
	
“*And then we had difficulties because the rural area; there was a lot of development and the postman on bicycles could not go, so we introduced motorcycles to deliver the mail. But earlier on, there were problems of postmen delivery. They used to be chased by dogs. “The postman had a wonderful job. The motto was ‘The mail must go on – rain or shine*’”.
