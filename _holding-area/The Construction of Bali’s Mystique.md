#### In 1953, four pioneering Singapore artists held an exhibition of artworks arising from their travels to Bali the previous year. Their trip was inspired by an image of the island as an untouched Eden.

Mention Bali and the image that springs to mind is that of a paradise on earth, with its verdant hills, cascading rice terraces, pristine beaches, mesmerising dances and beautiful local women. This image, however, did not appear out of nowhere. Key to shaping popular imagination have been cultural products like books and films that use the island as a backdrop which, in turn, reinforce the image of Bali as a paradise. The 2010 biographical romantic drama _Eat Pray Love_ – a movie starring Julia Roberts about a woman who searches for self-discovery as she journeys to Italy, India and Bali – is a well-known example of a movie that capitalises on Bali’s allure.1 

The construction of Bali as a beautiful, mysterious and exotic destination is an effort that goes back to the early 20th century. An image initially constructed by colonial administrators who wanted to create a tourist destination eventually took on a life of its own as artists, writers, photographers, journalists and filmmakers descended on the island.


 Among the artists who were influenced by this image of Bali and who, in turn, also helped to burnish this image in the region were four pioneering Singapore artists – Liu Kang, Chen Chong Swee, Chen Wen Hsi and Cheong Soo Pieng. In 1952, they embarked on a seven-week journey across Indonesia from 8 June to 28 July, culminating in Bali. Inspired by the island’s lush landscapes, rich culture and artistic traditions, the artists’ 1953 exhibition of paintings and sketches arising from this trip is considered a major milestone in Singapore’s art history.2 

In his oral history interview, Liu Kang recalled: “We had an impression of the island of Bali from a long time ago because we regularly saw reports on Bali in books and illustrated magazines, especially those with pictures introducing Bali. \[We\] felt that Bali had incredible natural scenery, the attire their locals wore and their dances were all excellent subject matter for drawing.”3 

#### **The Hidden Side of Paradise **

Bali’s reputation as an island paradise today emerged from a complex interplay of historical, political and sociocultural factors. Colonial narratives, coupled with the strategic promotion of the island as a tourist attraction, combined with the rise of leisure travel in the early 20th century made destinations in Southeast Asia such as Bali more accessible to Western travellers. These factors, together with the island’s unique cultural and physical landscape, created a captivating portrayal of Bali. However, the romanticised image of paradise often obscures the impact of colonisation on Bali and its people. 

The first documented European contact with Bali was in 1597 when merchants from Amsterdam, led by Cornelis de Houtman, arrived on the island after a two-year journey. The Dutch fleet was reportedly impressed by the Balinese prosperity and hospitality, in contrast to the austere Islamic sultanates of Java.4 The trip was instrumental in opening up the East Indies and the Indonesian spice trade to the Dutch as well as the eventual formation of the Dutch East India Company in 1602. 

In the 17th and 18th centuries, the growth and expansion of the Dutch East India Company laid the groundwork for deeper Western influence in the region. By the 19th century, the Dutch had asserted control over Bali through a series of military interventions, fuelled by pretexts like the Balinese practice of _tawan karang_, or the right to salvage shipwrecks. The Dutch final conquest of Bali in the early 20th century, marked by fierce battles and _puputan_ (carrying out mass ritual suicides to avoid the humiliation of surrender), could be seen as symbolic of the local resistance against the brutality of colonisation.5 

After the violent invasion of Bali, the Dutch colonial government sought to create a more “favourable” image with policies that aimed to, on the one hand preserve and protect the Indo-Javanese civilisation from modern influences and, on the other, promote tourism.6 This also tied in with the agenda by the Dutch to stifle political activity and contain the spread of nationalism in the rest of the archipelago.7 

#### **A Colonial Fantasy **

The Dutch developed infrastructure and promoted Bali as an exotic, untouched getaway, intertwining their economic and political ambitions with the island’s tourism.8 The establishment of the Association for Tourist Traffic in Netherlands India (“Netherlands India” refers to the Dutch East Indies, the colony of the Netherlands’ in Southeast Asia, primarily consisting of present-day Indonesia) marked an era of tourism efforts for the island, casting the Dutch East Indies as a coveted travel destination.9

By 1914, travel guides and brochures were promoting Bali as the “Gem of the Lesser Sunda Isles” and mythologising the archipelago with language like “Mystic Isles of Java, Sumatra and Bali” and “Romance of the East”.10 The 1928 inauguration of the Bali Hotel (present-day Inna Bali Heritage Hotel), the island’s first foray into “modern” hospitality, was orchestrated under the auspices of the Koninklijke Paketvaart Maatschappij (KPM; Royal Packet Navigation Company), a shipping line.11 

The KPM and other shipping lines also sponsored a number of early tourist pamphlets and publications such as the journal, _Sluyter’s Monthly_, which was later renamed _Inter-Ocean: A Netherlands East Indian Magazine Devoted to Malaysia and Australasia_.12 These efforts, coupled with the introduction of regular steamship services between Java and Bali in the 1920s, facilitated the influx of visitors seeking their slice of paradise.


#### **“Picture Perfect” **

Bali’s allure was also fuelled by the artists, photographers and writers who descended on the island in search of inspiration. Depictions of the island, from canvases to celluloid, created a compelling narrative that resonated with Western fantasies of Bali as a paradise.13 

The island often drew comparisons to French painter Paul Gaugin’s romantic image of Tahiti as an “untouched paradise”. Early European artists such as Wijnand Otto Jan Nieuwenkamp and Gregor Krause played a significant role in shaping the perception of Bali through their art. Nieuwenkamp, who was Dutch, was one of the first European artists to visit Bali. His illustrated albums and publication, _Bali en Lombok_ (1906–10), introduced the island to a wider audience. Together with the German physician and photographer Gregor Krause, they advanced Bali’s appeal through the first exhibition of Balinese art in Amsterdam in 1918.14 

Krause’s 1920 publication, _Bali 1912_, paints a vivid portrait of Bali’s landscapes, people and customs. The book showcases a collection of nearly 400 photographs curated from thousands taken during his stint as a medical officer in Bangli, near Ubud, from 1912 to 1914.15 His lens captured an idyllic vision of indigenous life that would later inspire other artists and writers. The Mexican painter Miguel Covarrubias, German artist Walter Spies and Austrian novelist Vicki Baum were among those drawn to Bali’s shores, their subsequent works further contributing to the island’s reputation as a paradise.16 

#### **Drawn to Bali **

Early European artists created an idyllic and even more romanticised vision of the island. Walter Spies, the Russian-born German polymath who visited Bali in 1927 and remained there until World War II, was part of a small yet influential expatriate community that shaped Bali’s image in the Western imagination. 

Armed with an extensive knowledge of Balinese culture, Spies made his home in Ubud a mandatory stop for artists, writers, scholars and other visitors to Bali.17 He also encouraged Dutch artist Rudolf Bonnet, who arrived in 1929, to stay on in Bali. The two men, together with a member of the Ubud ruling family, Cokorda Gde Agung Sukawati, and several Balinese artists, including I Gusti Nyoman Lempad, became involved in the Pita Maha Guild, which sought to stimulate art and professionalise local artists.18 Bonnet also designed and planned the construction of Museum Puri Lukisan showcasing traditional Balinese art, whose main building was completed in 1956.19 

The Belgian artist Adrien-Jean Le Mayeur de Merprès, who settled in Bali in 1932 after extensive travels, created Impressionist paintings often featuring his Balinese wife and muse – the renowned _legong_ dancer Ni Wayan Pollok Tjoeglik – in idyllic garden settings as well as Balinese women in sun-drenched scenes.20 His seaside home in Sanur was a popular spot for artists and tourists, offering dance performances and meals for a fee.21 Le Mayeur held four successful exhibitions in Singapore in 1933, 1935, 1937 and 1941.22 He said that Bali was his inspiration and his life. “I shall never leave Bali,” he once declared, “for I believe it will never be ‘spoiled’.”23 


The four Singapore artists – Liu Kang, Chen Chong Swee, Chen Wen Hsi and Cheong Soo Pieng – visited Le Mayeur during their 1952 Bali trip. The artists also attended one of the couple’s popular tourist programmes consisting of “Balinese dance and gamelan performances together with a sumptuous meal served under the frangipani trees”.24 

Other artists who captured Bali in their works and had exhibitions in Singapore include Julius and Tina Wentscher, the world-renowned painter and sculptor respectively, and the Russian artist Anatole Shister. The Wentschers held a joint exhibition at the YWCA in 1936. Their works, created in Java and Bali, included sculptures of a Balinese prince and a Balinese dancer, Sandri, and portrait paintings of Balinese girls.25
