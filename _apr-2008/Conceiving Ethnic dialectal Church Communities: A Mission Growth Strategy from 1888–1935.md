title: "Conceiving Ethnic dialectal Church Communities: A Mission Growth
  Strategy from 1888â€“1935"
permalink: /vol-4/issue1/apr-2008/ethnic-dialectal-church-communities/
description: "The French Roman Catholic Mission in Singapore found that church
  growth along ethnic lines was an effective strategy for indigenising and
  Asianising the local Catholic community in the pre-war years. Towards the turn
  of the century, the various dialectal communities within the Chinese Catholic
  Mission became sufficiently large enough to form separate parishes of their
  own. "
