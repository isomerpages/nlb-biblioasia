Let any unprejudiced European walk through the native<br> 
towns of Java, Singapore and China and see if he can find a<br> 
single native drunk. What he will meet with are numbers of<br> 
drunken English, Scotch and Irish seamen literally rolling<br> 
in the gutters, intoxicated, not from opium but from rum<br> 
and spirits sent all the way from England for the purpose of<br> 
enabling her worthy sons to exhibit themselves to Chinese<br> 
and other nations in this disgraceful light.1

First published in 1846, the above passage by G. F. Davidson was
reproduced in the *Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (SFPMA)*
in 1909.2 Europeans who were publicly drunk, in full view of Asians, were
described in the passage as problematic. Extant research on Europeans’
alcohol consumption in British colonies has shown that such perception
was informed by European anxieties surrounding white racial prestige.3

The drinking habits of low-class Europeans, such as seamen and sailors,
elicited anxiety. Barred from accessing exclusively “European” spaces due
to a lack of means as well as class- and profession-based restrictions, these
Europeans typically obtained and consumed alcohol in “public” or spaces
where they intermingled with Asians. The mechanics of inclusion-exclusion
among Europeans operated in part to define “Europeanness”. Its boundaries
were often contingent on “deviance”, even as what was considered deviant
was unfixed and constantly challenged. Examining the ways in which
“European deviance” was defined in different contexts and used as an
apparatus to differentiate between Europeans reveals the heterogeneity of
the colonial society, which is so often portrayed otherwise.4

As the opening quote suggests, the problematisation of some behaviour
such as public drunkenness was conceptualised in relation to its visibility
to the Asian population. Such exposures, according to colonial rhetoric,
potentially lowered European prestige in the eyes of the colonised. Yet,
to what extent was this concern justified in reality? Thus, apart from
examining the ways in which Europeans constructed European deviance,
I am interested in how Asians regarded such behaviour. Reviewing how
incidents of European deviant behaviour were reported in English- and
Chinese-language newspapers sheds light on the issue. The existing research
on newspapers in colonial Singapore helps elucidate the similarities and
differences between the two.5

This paper presents a comparative reading of reports on European
deviant behaviour in English- and Chinese-language newspapers in 1923–41,
the prewar period when the Chinese-language newspaper *Nanyang Siang
Pau* (南洋商报) is available in microfilm. I have focused on examining
the *Nanyang Siang Pau* in an extension of my previous research that had
examined English-language newspapers exclusively. As *Nanyang Siang Pau*
was a long-running daily newspaper, I examined one issue per month in
order to cover the entire period. Other newspapers, such as the *Malaya
Tribune*, the *Straits Times*, *SFPMA*, and *Sin Chew Jit Poh* (星洲日报),
served as cross-references. Examining the press coverage of the inquests
into the deaths of two Europeans, Douglas Vincent Gibson and Olvard
Wohl Schroeder, reveals varied perceptions of deviance and its role in social categorisation.

#### **European Deviant Behaviour in Colonial Singapore**

In colonial Singapore, whether a European’s behaviour was perceived as
deviant depended on and marked one’s distance from the ideal “respectable”
European. The boundaries of Europeanness, contingent and unfixed, were
sensitive to racial tensions in colonial contexts, and were class- and genderspecific.
6 Respectability was emphasised as a criterion of Europeanness,
not only as a justification for colonial rule, but also to keep “potentially
subversive” Europeans in check.7 In the early 20th century, the construction of Europeanness was closely intertwined with that of whiteness. In colonial
settings, whiteness and its privileges were conferred when individuals
exhibited a set of behaviour and characteristics that corresponded to the
projection of racial prestige, which required prescriptive social rules and
the resources to adhere to them.8 The distinctions within the European
population in colonial settings were dictated by conventions of European
middle-class respectability.9 As the “exclusionary politics of colonialism”
demanded conformity, deviations from such conventions, or displays
of behaviour deemed incompatible or contradictory, destabilised and
challenged the boundaries of Europeanness.10

The proximity and visibility of European deviant behaviour to the
colonised Asian populations shaped how problematic it was. Colonial
authorities and Europeans of higher social status balked when Europeans
were found behaving undesirably in “public” or in spaces where they could
be seen by people of various ethnicities, as compared to European-only
spaces. Such indiscretions were feared to threaten the colonial sociopolitical
hierarchy, and contributed to the colonial elites’ anxieties surrounding
racial prestige.

#### **Reports of European Deviant Behaviour in Newspapers**

The press played an instrumental role in amplifying some behaviour as
deviant and reinforced associations of low-class Europeans and deviant
behaviour. As a producer of discourse, the press constructed narratives
through reportage and advocated for interventions from the colonial
authorities and civic organisations towards purported crises.11 The various
English-language newspapers often carried similar or reproduced accounts
of perceived deviant behaviour of Europeans. The *Straits Times*, especially,
was considered by the residents in Singapore as a “European paper”, pertaining to its readership and perspective.12 The proliferation of accounts
thus illustrates not just anxieties surrounding European deviance, but also
their role in cautioning “respectable” Europeans against similar actions.

European drunkenness in public, for example, was often reported
in English-language newspapers as being accompanied by “disorderly”
conduct, such as violence. The perpetrators were typically identified as
transient Europeans or Europeans of lower social status, such as seamen
and rank-and-file soldiers.13 In 1931, the *Straits Times*, *SFPMA*, and *Malaya
Tribune* reported that a Private Edward Hayes had allegedly assaulted a
police constable in Hill Street while intoxicated.14 These reports would
have reinforced contemporary stereotypes of working-class or lower-status
European men as oft-drunk and violent.15

The case also highlights the spatiality of what constituted European
deviant behaviour. Europeans of higher social status and with greater
financial resources could afford to consume alcohol at premises that served
exclusively European clientele, such as clubs and hotels.16 Their imbibition
of large quantities of alcohol and drunken behaviour were rarely reported
in the newspapers. In contrast, Europeans of lower social status, who were
typically excluded from these places, obtained their alcoholic beverages
from spaces designated as “public”, such as public houses, liquor shops
and grogshops. Inter-ethnic interactions took place in these spaces, as
the beverages in these places were affordable, fuelling colonial anxieties
surrounding the visibility of European drunkenness and disorderliness.
According to newspaper reports, Europeans were typically arrested for
drunk and disorderly conduct near the docks at Tanjong Pagar, an area
frequented by Europeans of lower social status, further illustrating their marginality.17 As being “drunk and disorderly” in public was liable
to criminal charges, the proliferation of reports on such behaviour by
Europeans of lower social status reveals the disproportionate impact that
the criminalisation of such behaviour had on them. That the Europeans
who were deemed to have engaged in deviant behaviour were often of lower
social status highlights the relationship between space, social marginality,
and mobility.18

European deviant behaviour was discussed in English-language
newspaper editorials, and readers wrote letters to the editors, urging the
colonial authorities and social reform organisations to intervene. “Anxious
Parent”, for example, wrote to the editor of the *Malaya Tribune*, calling for
measures against prostitution. Brothels in the city centre, he proclaimed,
were tempting young British men to step on the “Road to Ruin”. He
questioned:

   What on earth is the use of preaching morality in our schools,<br>
   churches and chapels when immorality is allowed to thrive<br>
   and flourish almost one stone’s throw from our schools?<br>
   What are the missionaries doing? Why don’t they stir up the<br>
   responsible authorities? Is it not within their purview?19

The editor concurred, remarking that “surely the authorities have the
power to control so degrading an evil flourishing in the very heart of the
city.”20 Another letter agreed with the sentiments made, commenting that
the Esplanade had been made “the happy hunting ground of ladies of easy
virtue and the demi-monde generally every evening of the week”.21

In the Chinese press, on the other hand, incidents of European
deviance were typically confined to coverage in the “local news” (本坡新
闻) or “important local news” sections (本坡要闻). While evidently deemed
worthy of being reported, these cases did not prompt the kind of exuberant
discussion found in the English papers, likely owing to the significant demand for news from China because of its evolving political situation, or
simply the readers’ lack of interest in this topic.

The Chinese papers’ reports of European soldiers’ drunken and
disorderly behaviour suggest that deviant behaviour by Europeans –
particularly those of lower social status – was “visible” and noticed by the
Chinese population. In *Nanyang Siang Pau*’s report on the Hayes case,
Hayes was referred to as a *qiuba* (丘八)22 – a derogatory term for rankand-
file soldiers who had been in the military for a long time and acquired
deviant habits.23 The use of this term illustrates the stereotyping of lowranking
soldiers as disorderly. It also suggests that the Chinese differentiated
between “respectable” and “disreputable” Europeans, and that the latter
were identified by their deviant behaviour or disorderliness.

In February 1931, when a group of soldiers of the Welch Regiment
smashed the display windows of several shops and garages along Orchard
Road, they were described in English-language newspapers as having gone
“amok” and “behaving like lunatics”.24 In the 20th century, “amok” was a
racialised term that connoted “nativeness” and mania.25 Such descriptions of
the soldiers’ actions conveyed European disapproval of the behaviour; they
sought to establish a social distance between “respectable” Europeans and
these Europeans by emphasising the superiority of European rationality –
the cornerstone of British colonialism – vis-à-vis “native” irrationality, even
as they simultaneously undermined European superiority.

*Nanyang Siang Pau* adopted similar language in its headline: “Drunk?
Crazy? Welch soldiers create trouble in Orchard Road, glass windows
smashed”.26 The report continued: “according to rumours, the soldiers had lost their composure and caused a commotion because they had consumed
excessive alcohol”.27 Such postulation about whether the soldiers were
drunk was absent in the English reports, which suggests that the association
between soldiers, perceived inherent disorderliness and drunkenness was so
entrenched that the reporters of the English papers did not find it necessary
to state that the soldiers might be intoxicated. By attributing the soldiers’
disorderliness to intoxication, the Chinese-language press stopped short of
accusing these men of being crazy or irrational, which would have directly
contradicted the colonial rhetoric of European superiority and rationality.

The headlines of the Chinese-language newspaper reports of European
deviant behaviour were typically descriptive and at times sensationalised,
although such sensationalism was certainly influenced by the papers’
overall editorial and presentation style. In comparison, the English papers’
headlines were typically less descriptive. In January 1939, a soldier by the
name of James McAlister was charged with “disorderly behaviour in public”.
A member of the Loyal Regiment stationed at the Gillman Barracks,
McAlister was spotted by a policeman allegedly harassing passersby while
intoxicated in Waterloo Street. Thereafter he assaulted the policeman as he
resisted arrest, and damaged furniture in the Beach Road Police Station
lock-up. He was charged in the Second Police Court, and the news was
reported in the papers over the following two days.28 The articles in the
English papers generally had short and sometimes vague headlines. The
*Straits Times* reported, “Soldier charged with disorderly behaviour”; the
*SFPMA* similarly reported, “Charges against a soldier”; and the *Malaya
Tribune* printed, “Policeman’s nose broken: Loyal soldier charged”.29 In
comparison, *Nanyang Siang Pau* descriptively reported in its headline
that “McAlister, soldier stationed at Changi [sic], having been drunk and
disorderly, injured police and destroyed property, was charged on three
counts, and a hearing has been scheduled”.30

The hearing on 13 February was also reported in newspapers of both
languages. This time, the English papers had more descriptive headlines
than in their earlier reports of the case. The *SFPMA* wrote, “Loyals private
breaks nose of policeman: Was chasing pedestrians”, and the *Malaya
Tribune* quoted from the hearing that it was “A case of being violently
drunk”.31 The *Morning Tribune* (the morning edition of the *Malaya Tribune*)
reported that it was a “‘Case not for leniency’ says magistrate”.32 The two
*Tribunes* published similar reports detailing the hearing, with subheadings
highlighting that McAlister had “punched” the police constable after
having drunk “cheap wine”.33 All three articles reported that a Lieutenant
H. M. Miles of the Loyal Regiment had testified that McAlister “bore
a good character in the army”, and implicitly posited that the violence
that took place was a consequence of his consumption of “cheap wine”
of seemingly dubious quality.34 In particular, in the two *Tribune* articles,
Miles’s testimony was printed in bold under the subheading “Cheap wine”.35
Such presentation reiterated a contemporary perceived correlation between
“cheap” alcohol and disorderly conduct among European soldiers.

In comparison, *Nanyang Siang Pau* carried the headline, “McAlister,
who committed violent assault in Waterloo Street, found guilty on all three
charges”, while *Sin Chew Jit Poh* subsumed McAlister’s case under an article
reporting the court hearing of three British soldiers with a general headline,
“Three English [or British] soldiers violate the law again”.36 Both reports
narrated an account of what happened on 30 January and the sentence
McAlister received, without mentioning Miles’s testimony or the type of
alcohol McAlister had allegedly consumed.

Specifically attributing low-class European disorderliness to the “cheap”
alcohol, the English-language reports legitimised broader European perception of “cheap” alcohol – typically sold by Asians – as dubious and
nefarious. In his memoir, the English merchant W. H. M. Read described
the liquor sold in grogshops that were predominantly run by Chinese
and Indians:

   Brandy was defiled with tobacco juice, and red chilies were<br>
   inserted to give the spirit pungency. I know the case of the<br>
   boatswain of a man-of-war, who drank only one glass of one<br>
   of these concoctions, and was rendered mad-drunk, it being<br>
   more than a week before he was again fit for duty.37
