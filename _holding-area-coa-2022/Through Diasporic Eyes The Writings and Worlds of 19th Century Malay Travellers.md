When we reached the bottom of the ship, I looked around me astonished,
astonished, astonished, and no words will suffice, for I saw the magic
[<i>hikmat</i>] of those steam machines [<i>pesawat asap</i>]. Six to seven fathoms of
space were taken up by them alone! And I saw several people wiping, sweeping,
oiling and polishing the iron and brasswork until they gleamed like mirrors.
I saw nothing rusty, rough or dented, everything was smooth and shiny.1

                                    —Munshi Abdullah, 1841


#### **Introduction**
When Munshi Abdullah (1796–1849) wrote the first Malay account of a steamship in 1841, he rendered a strange metal contraption of pipes, boilers and engines for his audience in terms and imagery they could understand. As the first Malay-authored work to be printed and commercially sold, <i>Cerita Kapal Asap</i> (The Tale of the Steamship) was part of a wider turning point in Malay history: from an era of sail and scribes, into the industrial
civilisation of steam and print.

This essay explores that transition as a mediated process, where a new Malay world was generated as much through reinvention from within as it was by external disruption, primarily European forces. It uses stories about travel to examine how Malays redefined the relationship between the local and foreign. As new technologies of transport and communication accelerated the integration of Southeast Asia into colonial empires, travel
became a means for Europeans to establish their authority over subjugated landscapes and peoples. Prolific studies have examined European travelogues, which began as adventurous accounts about the conquest of indigenous societies, and later reflected the rise in commercial tourism after the opening of the Suez Canal.2 The stock personalities, imagery and settings of Somerset Maugham and Isabella Bird, among many, portrayed
a distinctive colonial style that developed in British Malaya during the late 1800s. More importantly, their imaginative construction of space and place were arguments for European imperialism. As Lily Kong and Victor Savage noted, these works regularly featured the exotic peoples and lush tropics alternately feared and idealised, consistent with Edward Said and David Arnold’s influential theories considering the link between representation
and power.3
