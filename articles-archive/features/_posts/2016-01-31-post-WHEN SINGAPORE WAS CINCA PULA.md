A 455-year-old map of Southeast Asia tells of the seafaring adventures of 16th century voyagers, whose journeys took them to exciting, uncharted territories waiting to be explored. As the intrepid 
voyagers discovered new trade routes in Asia, these unknown lands slowly came into prominence. We are familiar with most of them today; one, in particular, stands out – a place indicated on the map as C. Cinca Pula. 

*India Tercera Nuova Tavola* is one of the first early modern maps of Southeast Asia. It is also the National Library’s earliest map that makes reference to a Cinca Pula – which scholars believe refers to either the town of Singapore, one of several straits on which Singapore sits, a cape, or the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula.1 In this map, Cinca Pula refers specifically to a promontory – C.[abo] Cinca Pula or Cape of Cinca Pula. Re-issued up until 1599, the map was created at a time when European traders were exploring new routes to the East of India, including the Spice Islands in Southeast Asia.2
Singapore’s presence on this map suggests that it had an active role in the pre-colonial trade in 
the region.

Created by the Italian cartographer Girolamo Ruscelli, the map, which is slightly smaller than a sheet of A4 paper, is made up of two sheets of paper seamed together. Ruscelli’s map is based on a pocket-sized engraving created in 1548 by another Italian cartographer, Giacomo Gastaldi. 
Gastaldi, in turn, had based the map on the groundbreaking work of the 2nd-century Greek mathematician and astronomer Claudius Ptolemy as well as information gleaned from new European discoveries. Ptolemy’s use of the grid system in his work *Geographia* (or in English, *Geography*) to map the world became the basis of modern cartography as we know it today. 

Gastaldi’s map marked a significant shift away from the traditional practice of woodblock printing, the method used to produce Ptolemic maps.3 Engraved on copper, Gastaldi’s maps were clearer and more detailed than woodblock printed maps; this costly method of printing maps had been abandoned for four decades before it was revived by Gastaldi.4
