#### Through government reports and reviews held at the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library, Librarian _Wee Tong Bao_ traces the evolution of Singapore’s education system.

Among the little known national treasures on the shelves of the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library is a large collection of government reports and reviews on various subjects. One subject on which the Library has a wealth of documents and tracts is the history of Singapore’s education system. When the policies and inquiries that had been published from the founding of modern Singapore till 1978 are examined chronologically, one can see the evolution of Singapore’s education system from a laissez-faire arrangement to a nationally centralised system by the late 1970s.

In the beginning, British administrators were concerned only with providing primary education in the schools they had established. Missionaries and communal leaders had also set up schools of their own using money that the government provided, in the form of “grants-in-aid”. From 1870 till the start of World War II, the colonial government paid more attention to the island’s schools when it commissioned inquiries into the different aspects of education. Many committees were formed to review teaching and other aspects of the education system in the English and Malay vernacular schools. Reports were written on how funds were disbursed to schools, recommendations for the curriculum for government Malay vernacular schools as well as the provision of tertiary education in the English school system. Many of these reports were later named after the respective chairpersons heading the inquiries.

#### **The Education System before World War I**

The founder of Singapore, Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, had professed that:

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“*…our stations not only become the centres of commerce* <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*and its luxuries, but of refinement and the liberal arts. If* <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*commerce brings wealth to our shores, it is the spirit of* <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*literature and philanthropy that teaches us how to employ* <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*it for the noblest purposes*.” 1

The British presence on the island was represented by the East India Company, which was mainly concerned with trade. This being so, the British administrators initially focused on commerce, leaving most of the other social concerns such as education to the different communities on the island. In 1858, the colony, along with two other settlements (Penang and Malacca) in the Malacca Strait, was put under the control of the Governor-General of India. The administrators maintained their laissez-faire approach to education in the Straits Settlements. Things begin to change with the transfer of oversight from the India Office to the Colonial Office in London in 1867. The new British administration became actively interested in the affairs of the Straits Settlements and forced various committees to look into various sectors. In 1870, the Woolley Committee compiled a report on the state of education in the colony. 2 In 1872, the position of inspector of schools was created to take charge of educational matters in the Strait Settlements. The first person to fill this position was A. M. Skinner.3
