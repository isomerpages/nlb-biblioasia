#### **Introduction**
Studying colonial writings, let alone understanding them, is a complex
undertaking. Ideas were relative to the author and could change over
time with global historical and intellectual developments. An author’s
perception could also change with age, experience and exposure to new
knowledge material. These features can be observed in the vast writings of
Dr John Crawfurd (1783–1868), Singapore’s second Resident, who served
with distinction from 1823 to 1826. Yet there is a tendency for scholars to
generalise their findings after reading selections or passages of an author’s
works. Examining only a fragment of an author’s writings will often yield
the expected results – a partial picture of the author’s ideas.

Mary Quilty’s *Textual Empires: A Reading of Early British Histories of
Southeast Asia* provides excellent coverage of the writings of key early
19th-century colonial writers on the Malay Peninsula, such as John Leyden
(1775–1811), Thomas Stamford Raffles (1781–1826), William Marsden
(1754 –1836), John Anderson (1795–1845) as well as Crawfurd. She goes
to great lengths to underscore the characteristics of their works and the intellectual influences that shaped their ideas and how their works
influenced the findings of others.[^1] 

Quilty’s analysis of Crawfurd’s writings, however, is limited to just three
of his publications. Her conclusion might have been different had she read
his other works. In total, Crawfurd wrote more than 70 books, periodicals
and articles in the course of his life. Nonetheless, given that her research
was published in 1998, Quilty might not have had the opportunity to access
Crawfurd’s other writings, as she would have today thanks to digitisation.
In spite of this, Gareth Knapman’s recent research on Crawfurd has shown
that Crawfurd’s opinions are still misunderstood – Crawfurd’s writings were
selected out of context and used to simplify 19th-century thought to the
point of misrepresentation.[^2] 

This paper seeks to explore Crawfurd’s diverse intellectual works to
determine how the inhabitants of the Malay Peninsula fit into his ideas on
ethnology and global views on history, and how he sought to apply these
concepts to chart the region’s history. Discussions regarding the traditional
homeland of the Malay Peninsula’s inhabitants, especially the Malays, are
a regular feature of his writings, and he would tie his hypothesis regarding
their origins to his ethnological view on the multiple origins of mankind. As
would become clear in his later ethnological articles, he explains the history
of the Malay Peninsula’s civilisational development in terms of his biological,
geographical and cultural understanding of the progress of mankind.

This paper will also examine how his ideas about the region were developed.
This offers us a glimpse of how British colonial discourse functioned, at least
during the 19th century. Some of Crawfurd’s knowledge was drawn directly
from his experiences and observations in the region, while others were
obtained from secondary readings and correspondence with his network
of scholars and sources in Europe and Asia. Although the Malay Peninsula during Crawfurd’s time was already home to multiracial communities, only
his views on what he considered the natives of the region – the Malays and
Aslian communities – will be covered in this study for reasons of scope.
His ideas about the mixed-race communities of the Straits, however, will be
touched on because of their connection with the local populace.

Among the 19th-century British scholar-administrators of the Malay
Peninsula, Crawfurd was one of the most accomplished in the intellectual
sphere. He was widely recognised by the scholarly community of his time
for his formidable intellect and his works on Asia (especially Southeast Asia),
as well as his contributions to the fields of ethnology and linguistics.[^3] *The
Spectator* noted in 1834 that “Crawfurd [was] well-known by his writings on
Eastern manners and statistics, and his exertions to open the British trade
with China and India”.[^4] Sir Frank Swettenham (1850–1946), former governor
of the Straits Settlements and commissioner for the Federated Malay States,
found that of Raffles, Marsden and Crawfurd, the latter wrote about the
Malay language with “probably the highest authority”.[^5]

Crawfurd’s writings on Southeast Asia provided a wealth of information for
those with an interest in the region, especially merchants, intellectuals and
imperial civil servants (both aspiring and serving). They are still appreciated
for the insights they provide into Southeast Asia’s past, however flawed they
may be from today’s standpoint.[^6] In his intellectual pursuits, Crawfurd, like
many of his contemporaries, sought to understand the interplay between
mankind and its history. The inhabitants of the Malay Peninsula were often featured in his extensive writings on ethnology and (what would
now be termed as) world history. Crawfurd would, furthermore, use his
understanding of the Malay Peninsula’s inhabitants – racial features,
languages, their place in the civilisation scale of mankind and how they
got there, and communities that emerged out of interracial marriage – to
support his scientific position on human nature and their history, as well as
his views on polygenesis.

#### **A Sketch of Crawfurd’s Life and Career**
John Crawfurd was born on 13 August 1783, on the island of Islay in the
west of Scotland.[^7] His father, Samuel Crawfurd, was a medical doctor from
Ayrshire, known to be “a man of sense and prudence”, and his mother
was Margaret née Campbell.[^8] Crawfurd was educated in a village school
in Bowmore, Islay. In 1799, he enrolled in medical school in Edinburgh;
medicine was a field for which, “he never had much taste, having been
chosen for him”, according to his 1868 obituary in *The Sydney Morning
Herald*.[^9] It later became evident that Crawfurd’s interests lay in languages,
history, ethnology, natural sciences and political administration.

At the conclusion of his studies in 1803, he left for Calcutta, India, as an
assistant surgeon in the East India Company’s Bengal medical service,
being assigned to the army.[^10] In 1808, after five years of active service in the
northwestern provinces of India, Crawfurd was appointed to the medical
staff of Prince of Wales Island (present-day Penang), where he used his time to study the Malay language and its people.[^11] In 1811, together with Thomas
Stamford Raffles and John Leyden, Crawfurd was invited by Lord Minto
(1751–1814, also known as Gilbert Elliot, then Governor-General of India) to
accompany him on a military expedition against the Dutch in Java.[^12]

This marked a major turning point in Crawfurd’s career; he would become,
as the anthropologist Ter Ellingson would best describe him, “a doctorturned-
colonial-diplomat”.[^13] He held various senior administrative posts
during the British occupation of Java (1811–16) because of his command
of the Malay language, eventually becoming Resident at the central court
of the Sultan of Yogyakarta.[^14] Crawfurd studied both ancient Kawi and
contemporary Javanese and befriended the Javanese aristocratic literati.[^15]

Upon his return to Britain in 1817, he became a fellow of the Royal Society.
The advantage of Crawfurd’s position and local connections in the Malay
Peninsula and Java enabled him to acquire a number of local manuscripts.[^16]
He would later compile the information he had gathered during his sojourn
in Southeast Asia and publish his widely-acclaimed three-volume *History of
the Indian Archipelago* in 1820.[^17] This seminal work, according to an article
a few decades later in the *Journal of the Indian Archipelago and Eastern Asia*,
placed “him in the first rank of ethnographers”.[^18]

In 1821, Crawfurd left England again for India; this time he was assigned
to head a mission to Siam (present-day Thailand) and Cochin China (now
Vietnam), with the chief objective of establishing trade. This mission did not succeed because of suspicions raised among local authorities, and he was
unable to expand the East India Company’s commercial relations beyond
the status quo.[^19] On 9 June 1823, Crawfurd succeeded William Farquhar
(1774–1839) to become the second Resident of Singapore – Crawfurd had
first visited the island in 1822 en route from India to Siam – and remained
in office until 1826.[^20] He continued to be active in the British East India
Company after serving as Resident in Singapore, undertaking diplomatic
assignments in Burma, before retiring from the Company in 1827.[^21]

Crawfurd attempted to run for Parliament, but was unsuccessful in his
election campaigns in Scotland and England.[^22] Although he had left the
region for good, he continued to take a great interest in matters concerning
the Far East until the end of his life, as evident in his continued publications
on the region. He also became the first president of the London-based Straits
Settlements Association on 31 January 1868.[^23] Crawfurd passed away on the
night of 11 May 1868, at his residence in Elvaston Place, South Kensington,
London, at the age of 85, and was survived by his son and two daughters.[^24]

#### **Crawfurd’s Studies and the Workings of British Imperial Knowledge**
Crawfurd’s obituaries tell us that his literary fame continued to rise even
after he ended his career in Asia, to the extent that it seemed to have
outshone his civil service accomplishments in the Far East.[^25] In spite of
his unsuccessful attempts in getting elected into the House of Commons,
Crawfurd continued making headlines in the scholarly world by producing
notable publications such as *A Grammar and Dictionary of the Malay Language* (1852) and *A Descriptive Dictionary of the Indian Islands &amp; Adjacent
Countries* (1858), as well as through his journal contributions to the scholarly
periodical of the Ethnological Society of London – which he led in 1861 as
president.[^26] As a leading ethnographer and expert on Southeast Asia, he was
well known among prominent intellectuals of the time, and was counted
among Charles Darwin’s circle of friends.[^27]

Crawfurd’s publications on the Far East were the result of his extensive
journeys and voyages during his time in the region, where he amassed diverse
materials on ethnology, natural history, local history, geography and geology.[^28]
Examining his major publications on Southeast Asia, such as *History of the
Indian Archipelago, Grammar and Dictionary of the Malay Language or A
Descriptive Dictionary of the Indian Islands and Adjacent Countries*, would
allow one to grasp how he developed his knowledge about the region and,
more importantly, the features of British imperial knowledge.

Much has been said since the publication of Edward Said’s remarkable 1978
work, *Orientalism*, which highlighted the issue of Euro-centrism in Western
writings on the rest of the world and its literature as a means of justifying
superiority over non-Western peoples (in other words, imperialism).[^29]
To accomplish these agenda, Said demonstrated how the East had been
projected in a way that differentiated it from the West, hence making it the
“other”.[^30] As expected, the result was inaccurate, sensational and exaggerated
portrayals of the East in Western discourse.

*Orientalism*, nevertheless, only reveals one aspect of imperial literature, and
must not be taken as representative of all colonial writings about the outside
world. They were more than just about creating tales to satisfy imperialistic
agenda. Discussing British knowledge productions of India, Christopher
Bayly underscored that they arose from natural curiosity and the desire to
understand the world as it was, as well as from the simple aim of domination.[^31]

We must move beyond the fashionable notion of “knowledge is power” and
consider the diversity of knowledge. To be more comprehensive, attention
should be given to the author’s intention or purpose of writing, and to
examine whether the publication was intended as a fictional work, to
advance scientific knowledge, to collect commercial data, for administrative
purposes (such as population census and surveying reports), to serve as
official information on the region (for instance, literature on travel, science,
and history), or as a medium to support a policy.

The knowledge produced by Crawfurd belonged to the category of
formal, or “factual”, information, where accuracy was of key concern. The
reputation of his publications rested on how others measured the quality
of information provided. Any inaccuracies or unfaithful representations
would degrade the reputation of his work and scholars who produced these
kinds of literature were well aware of that. Fictionalising foreign places and
their inhabitants would not serve the interest of the author and his readers,
whose primary concern was to obtain factual information on the region.
Reviews would appraise these works for the quality of information they
provided, as evidenced in a review of Crawfurd’s 1858 dictionary by the
*Journal of the Indian Archipelago and Eastern Asia*: “[It is] a ready source of
accurate information of the most varied and substantial kind, conveyed in
an agreeable, condensed and lucid style, the book is invaluable”.[^32]

Quilty has shown that scholars of the Malay world such as Crawfurd,
Raffles and Marsden had the same desire for their works to educate the
public and help expand their general knowledge of the world.[^33] They were
not interested in creating sensational stories about the Far East, and this
was explicitly stated in Crawfurd’s positive remarks on Marsden’s *History
of Sumatra* (1818): “He was the first literary and scientific Englishman who,
with the advantages of local experience, treated of the Malayan countries;
all our knowledge before him being confined to the crude narratives of
mariners and voyagers”.[^34]

If misinformation was provided, it was also often done so unintentionally.
Inaccuracy could stem from the inability to gain access to the desired information, and scholars often had to resort to other means of obtaining
it, such as hearsay, the accounts of travelling merchants, explorers and
travellers, and from studying literature about the region – both antiquated
and recent. In many respects, these works are not very different in their
approach from contemporary scholarly literature.

Reading Crawfurd’s publications on Southeast Asia would reveal that his
main concern was the search for truths. This is not to say, however, that
the knowledge produced by colonial scholars such as Crawfurd were free
from misconceptions, as evidenced in the response by Indian nationalist,
politician and scholar, Dadabhai Naoroji (1827–1917), towards Crawfurd’s
article, “On the Physical and Mental Characteristics of the European
and Asiatic Races of Man”.[^35] Naoroji rebuked Crawfurd’s description of
the supposed mental inferiority of Asians to Europeans, saying that this
“superficial observation and imperfect information” was one that was
typical of foreign travellers and writers.[^36] Nonetheless, the fact that Naoroji’s
criticism of his work was read to and published in the Ethnological Society
of London’s periodical suggests that there was interest among its members
to test the strength of Crawfurd’s hypothesis.

As a historian, Crawfurd would assess the quality of his information to
determine its reliability, compare it to other available sources and discuss
its contents.[^37] Where the accuracy of the information was in question and
he had no alternative sources, Crawfurd would caution his audiences to
give the source the benefit of the doubt. In a footnote in *History of the
Indian Archipelago*, for example, he warned his readers to take the account
of the introduction of Islam into Macassar by the 17th-century French
merchant and traveler, Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, with a grain of salt, because
he “generally found Tavernier a superficial and unfaithful narrator”.[^38]
Crawfurd would also admit his lack of knowledge in subjects he was unsure
about, as shown in his 1866 ethnological paper on the physical and mental characteristics of the “Negro”: “Of the social condition of the small Negroes
of the Malay Peninsula and the Philippine Islands we know too little to
enable us to give any authentic details”.[^39] In *A Descriptive Dictionary of
the Indian Islands and Adjacent Countries*, he also acknowledged that his
works might not be free from mistakes, which suggests that he was leaving
room for others to improve on his findings, although he did not directly
express this:

   *Some of the articles are meagre from want of materials, and<br>
   others, without doubt, imperfect and unsatisfactory from defective<br>
   knowledge or skill in the writer… it will, at all events, lay the<br>
   foundation for a more perfect superstructure by those who may<br>
   follow the Author in the same direction*.[^40]

This shows that Orientalists such as Crawfurd were well aware that the
information they had on the outside world was far from perfect, questioned
its validity, and sought to improve and add new insights to its existing pool
of knowledge.

Crawfurd was not an Orientalist who drew his conclusions about the Far
East by merely theorising about the region from the comforts of his study.
When writing about Southeast Asia and its inhabitants, he drew some of
his ideas from personal observations, experiences and surveys conducted in
the region, as well as from materials he collected there, such as indigenous
manuscripts.[^41] His emphasis on history in his writings and in forwarding
his arguments made him stand out as a historian, and he relied on both
indigenous and European historical sources when writing about the
inhabitants of Asia and other parts of the world.

On unfamiliar topics, Crawfurd would refer to the works of other scholars
such as Marsden, Raffles, Anderson, Thomas John Newbold (1807–50) and
James Richardson Logan (1819–69), as well as the writings and accounts
of European adventurers and explorers to the region such as James Cook (1728–1779) and William Dampier (1651–1715) despite his dismissive
comments (as mentioned earlier) about the crude narratives of some
mariners.[^42] Some of his information was obtained directly from locals and
from questioning local tradition and beliefs, essentially demonstrating
that indigenous knowledge was a feature of imperial knowledge of the
outside world and was not solely a Western construct.[^43] In J*ournal of an
Embassy from the Governor-General of India to the Courts of Siam and Cochin
China* (1828), for instance, Crawfurd revealed that he relied on his Malay
interpreters in his travels to furnish him with local knowledge.[^44]

Crawfurd’s low opinion of indigenous historical sources has been singled
out by scholars as an example of dismissive Western attitudes toward
Eastern histories.[^45] However, his concern was the search for reliable
historical information on the region that he unfortunately found lacking in
indigenous sources, and he had at least consulted and even cited them rather
than side-lining them outright.[^46] He dismissed them for the same reason
he dismissed unreliable Western histories, not merely because they were
indigenous histories.

The difficulty of finding reliable local historical texts was stressed by
Crawfurd when writing about Malacca in his 1858 dictionary. He noted,
“the native history of Malacca is as usual full of obscurity… There is too
much reason to believe that the greater part of the story is a fabrication of
comparative recent times, and indeed, there is sufficient internal evidence of its being so”.[^47] Even today some scholars are of the opinion that Malay
“historical” works, such as *Sulalatus Salatin*, or the *Malay Annals*, should be
regarded as literature rather than a historical record. In the words of Malay
scholar Muhammad Salleh Yaapar, “It does not have reliable dates, and its
narrative lacks logic”.[^48]

Both his and Crawfurd’s words are strikingly similar. Crawfurd had also
criticised Western sources that he found questionable and furthermore
pointed out that the Malays’ ignorance of historical composition and lack
of historical records should be expected from those who were in that “state
of society”.[^49] Even the British, Crawfurd reasoned, had to rely on Roman
records for their early history.[^50] Those who have criticised his low regard for
Asian history seem to have missed out on this sentiment.

British imperial knowledge of foreign places has to be seen as a collection of
individual ideas, because not everyone had the same understanding of the
world. Crawfurd, for instance, would often contest views that he did not
agree with, such as the commonly perceived notion of laziness among the
inhabitants of the Indian Archipelago.[^51] In *History of the Indian Archipelago*,
Crawfurd pointed out that laziness was not an innate characteristic of the
natives, noting that their attitude was understandable because there was no
encouragement to work hard and accumulate wealth in a society where there
were no laws protecting private property.[^52]

As already suggested, Crawfurd’s ideas were not developed solely from
his own personal reasoning, but also drawn from studying the works of
others, just as the findings of researchers today are shaped by the study of
scholarly literature and their own findings. Besides texts, Crawfurd also maintained his own global network of scholars and sources with whom he
would exchange knowledge and information. He would, time and again,
thank these individuals who had furnished him with details and offered
feedback on his work. This can be observed in *A Grammar and Dictionary
of the Malay Language with a Preliminary Dissertation*, where Crawfurd
thanks his friend Marsden for his help by sending Crawfurd his dictionary;
Professor of Sanskrit at Oxford Horace Hayman Wilson (1786–1860) for
his assistance with Sanskrit etymologies; and Logan and his journal for the
information they furnished on the region of his interest.[^53]

Such exchanges were another way Crawfurd addressed the gaps in his
knowledge and developed his ideas. Tracing his networks of intellectual
correspondence provides further insight into an aspect of how imperial
knowledge was developed, where ideas, information and knowledge were
drawn from different parts of the empire. Knowledge during Crawfurd’s
time was global and imperial writers did not develop their ideas solely
within the narrow confines of their own regions.

Discussing the framework in which imperial knowledge operated
through Crawfurd’s example is useful in helping us understand how
he developed his ideas about the inhabitants of the Malay Peninsula. It
was through a combination of his personal experiences and reasoning,
observations, study of historical sources and the findings of others, as well
as his engagement with scholars through his intellectual networks. His
purpose of study was to ascertain the truth, not unlike the objective of
contemporary scholarly pursuit.

#### **The Malay Peninsula in Crawfurd’s Writings and Debates on Ethnology and World History**
***Mixed Races***

As an active participant in the lively 19th-century scientific and philosophical
debates on the nature of mankind, Crawfurd took advantage of his
observations in Asia to roundly debunk the idea that offspring produced by the union or “commixture” of two different races would become sterile and
incapable of producing healthy children themselves (like mules that are a
hybrid between two opposite species of the same genus of lower animals).

In his article published in the journal of the Ethnological Society of London,
“On the Supposed Infecundity of Human Hybrids or Crosses”, which was
read in 1864 and published in 1865, Crawfurd highlighted the theory that
“mongrels resulting from the union of two different races of the human
family” were sterile. The idea, he noted, had “lately sprung up” and was
beginning to obtain currency in France and America.[^54] Crawfurd saw this
theory as one that was “without a shadow of foundation”, as evidenced by
the mixed-race communities in Asia, “which multiply just as fast as do the
parent stocks from which they derived”.[^55] He would have also drawn this
conclusion from his observations of the mixed-race communities in the
Malay Peninsula – as suggested in his other ethnological article, “On the
Commixture of the Races of Man as affecting the Progress of Civilisation”.[^56] 
Here, pointing to the Peranakan communities of the Malay Peninsula,
Crawfurd wrote that:

   *The intercourse and settlement are still in progress, and out of<br> 
   it has sprung a cross-breed known, as in the colonising Arabs<br> 
   and Chinese, by the term Páranakan [sic], with the national<br> 
   designation of the father annexed, and literally signifying<br> 
   “offspring of the womb”, a word of the same import as the<br> 
   Moplay or Mopilla referred to*.[^57]

In Malacca, which had been colonised by the Portuguese since 1511, he
observed that a cross-race of Eurasians had sprung up, and they had “so
much of Malay blood as to be hardly distinguishable from the Malays
themselves”.[^58] Crawfurd’s position on the children of mixed racial unions can be seen in this article – they would be an “intermediate” offspring,
superior to the race of the “inferior” parent, but inferior to the race of the
“superior” one.[^59] When discussing the Peranakan communities of the Malay
Peninsula, he pointed out that “these half-castes speak the language of the
father as well as that of the mother, and are distinguished from the pure
Malay by superior intelligence”.[^60]

In *History of the Indian Archipelago*, Crawfurd noted that Chinese who
intermarried “with the natives of the country, generate a race inferior in
energy and spirit” to the Chinese.[^61] Therefore, “the result of the union of a
Chinese and a Malay – one of frequent occurrence – is a deterioration in
the Chinese and an improvement in the Malay”.[^62] This was the reason why
Crawfurd, in *History of the Indian Archipelago*, wrote positively about mixedracial
unions in European colonies, especially between Europeans and the
local populace, because he believed it would improve the social conditions of
the indigenous society, just as the Turks in Europe, as he later wrote in 1865,
had been greatly improved by intermixture with European blood.[^63] 

Crawfurd, nevertheless, saw individuals of mixed races as a race unto their
own, as observed in an 1861 article, “On the Classification of the Races of
Man” for the Ethnological Society of London. He wrote, “Foreign invaders
who mixed their blood largely with that of the original inhabitants, resulting
in the production of a hybrid population originating in races distinct, yet
nearly allied”.[^64]

***Distinguishing the Races***

In his scientific views, Crawfurd was a believer in polygenesis, a theory that
supposes the multiple origins of mankind.[^65] Men were thought to comprise
different races, or species, that are spread across different geographical locations around the world.[^66] He opposed Darwinism, because of its stand
on the common origins of man, regarding the theory to be one without
foundation and unbacked by historical or archaeological evidence.[^67]
Crawfurd also assumed that each race was of “equal antiquity”, and the
reason behind their distribution across the globe, as with plants and animals,
was a mystery “beyond the power of our comprehension”.[^68]

He distinguished each race according to their external physical appearances,
such as the colour of the skin, hair and eyes; average height; hair texture
and facial features.[^69] But in spite of their differences, they all belonged to
the same genus of Man, just like how different breeds of dogs, although
having different physical features, are all of the same family.[^70] Crawfurd was
against using anatomy to distinguish the “species” of mankind, such as the
classification of races according to the shape of the skull that was promoted
by anatomist and naturalist Johann Friedrich Blumenbach (1752–1840) in
the publication of *De Generis Humani Varietate Nativa in 1795*.[^71]

Perhaps also drawing his conclusion from his knowledge of medicine,
Crawfurd stressed that regardless of race, one would not be able to tell the
difference between the skull of a “Hindu-Chinese” and a Malay.[^72] There is
moreover, he argued, no definite form in the human skull.[^73] Even the species of the same family of the lower animals, he stressed, “are often so alike,
that it is impossible to distinguish them from each other by their skulls”.[^74]

This was why Crawfurd thought it best to catalogue the different races of
mankind according to their outer physical features, and this was how he
distinguished the inhabitants of the Indian Archipelago and the Malay
Peninsula in his studies:

   *The physical form of the Malayan race of man… is of short<br> 
   stature… The face is lozenge-shaped, with a flat forehead, high<br> 
   cheek-bones, a prominent large mouth, and thin lips. The hair of<br> 
   the head is always black, coarse, lank, and abundant…. In this<br> 
   attempt to describe the physical characteristics of the Malayan<br> 
   race, I take no account of the form of the skull, because I am most<br> 
   satisfied that the most skilful craniologist would not be able to<br> 
   distinguish it from the skull of a Chinese, of a Tartar… of any<br> 
   other races of man having a low-bridged nose*.[^75]
	 
Crawfurd observed that the inhabitants of the Indian Archipelago
consist of many different races, which he divided into three groups based
on appearance: the brown-complexioned, straight-haired men, such as
the Malays; men of dark complexion, with woolly hair, who Crawfurd
termed “Oriental Negroes”, because their features were similar to “African
Negroes”, although Crawfurd knew that they were not actually of the
same race (as mentioned later); and men of brown complexion, with
frizzled hair, like the inhabitants of Timur.[^76]

The people of the Malay Peninsula comprised the brown-complexioned Malay
and the dark, woolly-haired, “Oriental Negroes”, also known locally as the
Sámang (Semang) or Bila.[^77] In *History of the Indian Archipelago*, Crawfurd
noted that, besides their appearance, even the languages spoken by the Archipelago’s “Oriental Negroes” were distinct from the brown-coloured races
of the Indian Archipelago, which would distinguish them as a separate race.[^78]

Crawfurd’s direct examination of the aboriginals of the Malay Peninsula,
the Orang Asli, seemed to be limited to the three Semangs he saw in Penang
and Singapore, and the Orang Laut.[^79] This was because he had not ventured
into the interiors of the Malay Peninsula and had to rely on the findings
of other Orientalists, such as James Richardson Logan and John Turnbull
Thomson (1821–84), when studying the other Aslian tribes.[^80] Those that
possessed Malay-like features – the Jakun, for instance – were deemed
to belong to the Malay group, which Crawfurd labelled as “uncultivated
Malays”.[^81]
81 The other two Malay classes were the “civilised Malays” and the
“sea gypsies”, or Orang Laut.[^82]

***Stages of Civilisation and Indicators of Cultural Progress***

In his views on the global progress of mankind, Crawfurd regarded the
Malays and Javanese to be the most civilised of the inhabitants of the
Indian Archipelago.[^83] In a manner that was consistent with the Scottish
Enlightenment philosophy of measuring the progress of mankind, which
was unsurprising considering his education in Edinburgh, he divided the
cultures of the world into different stages of civilisation, ranging from
refined to savage. He used cultural and material indicators to measure
their level of progress, such as the development of language and numerals,
advancement of their social order, development of the arts, tools used,
weaponry, state of agriculture, technology and architecture.[^84]

The (civilised) Malays, Crawfurd observed, were more advanced than
the “Oriental Negroes” of the Peninsula because they had learnt how to
domesticate animals and cultivate plants, possessed the art of writing and
use of numerals, and had knowledge of useful metals and how to work
them.[^85] The “Oriental Negroes” in contrast, who “wander[ed] the forests
in quest of a precarious subsistence, without fixed habitation” had not
developed letters and the use of numbers, and had achieved few or none
of the aforementioned cultural markers.[^86] There was also a connection
between wearing less clothing and savagery.[^87] The following entry in his 1858
dictionary nicely sums up his indicators of cultural progress:

   *The subsidiary or accessory causes which contributed to raise the<br> 
   indigenous civilisations to the point to which they had reached<br> 
   on the arrival of Europeans were, the possession of iron, of cereal<br> 
   corn, of the larger domesticated animals… Without the possession<br> 
   of iron no nation of the Malay or Philippine Archipelago has<br> 
   attained any respectable amount of civilisation. All of the nations<br> 
   that have possessed the art of phonetic writing, have also possessed a<br> 
   knowledge of this metal*.[^88]

To Crawfurd, material and cultural measures were indications of the state
of civilisation a race had attained. When it came to explaining how they got
there, he would identify access to domesticated animals and cultivated plants,
cross-cultural engagement with a superior race, geography and the intellectual
capacity of a race as the underlying factors that determined racial progress.[^89]
For a culture to develop, he believed, it needed access to resources necessary
for its growth, such as animals that could be domesticated and plants that could be cultivated.[^90] Contact with a superior civilisation, whether through
cross-cultural engagement or conquest, could also improve a race.[^91]

Cultures that thrive, Crawfurd pointed out, are located in places that
encourage development and have few geographical barriers, such as
impassable forests or mountains, that would impede growth.[^92] Access to
domesticated plants and animals and cross-cultural engagement are also
directly tied to geography – isolated cultures could not be expected to
benefit from cross-cultural contact and geographical barriers could prevent a
culture from obtaining the resources it needed for advancement.[^93] Crawfurd
often referred to the Eskimos as a case in point, stating that they could not
be expected to progress in the isolated and frozen lands they lived in, which
had little by way of plants or animals that would help growth.[^94] Crawfurd
also made an interesting remark that the inhabitants of Britain would still
be in a savage state, isolated in their lush forests, if the superior Romans –
who introduced letters and numerals to the savage and barbaric tribes of
Europe – had not undertaken their conquest.[^95]

But Crawfurd questioned why some races advanced more than others, in
spite of having the same civilisational advantages.[^96] Europe, for instance,
seemed to be progressing at a faster pace and had now surpassed countries
that were once more advanced than them, such as China.[^97] He reasoned that it was because each race had a different intellectual capacity, or in
Crawfurd’s words, “the quality of the race”.[^98] Europeans, of course, had the
highest mental aptitude, which explained their rapid advancement through
history and dominance during Crawfurd’s time.[^99] To sum up his views on
the development of mankind, racial advancement was, therefore, a function
of geographical, cultural and biological factors.

Crawfurd would then apply his ideas about the progress of mankind to
explain the history of the Malay Peninsula’s inhabitants, framing it within a
global context. The “Oriental Negroes” were on a lower scale of civilisation
because of their isolation in the dense forests and mountains of the interior.[^100]
The Malays had attained a certain degree of advancement from their superior
Sumatran homeland before migrating to the more geographically hostile
Malay Peninsula that was shrouded in dense forest, “a serious and almost
insuperable obstacle to the early progress of civilisation”..[^101]

Crawfurd saw that the Malays’ civilisation was improved by their contact
with Hinduism and, later, Islam, from where they obtained their letters,
culture and some of their numerals..[^102] Only the most advanced nations of
the Archipelago had converted to Islam, while “the more savage tribes”
remain unconverted up to the present day..[^103] He even hinted in his paper,
“On the Physical and Mental Characteristics of the Negro”, that the
“Oriental Negroes” of the Peninsula would be improved if they embraced Islam..[^104] While Crawfurd thought that Islam was on the whole beneficial to
the Malays, Raffles, on the contrary, thought that it degraded them..[^105]

#### **Climate as a Factor of Mankind’s Biological and Social Characteristics**

The scientific and medical belief in climate as a major determinant
of the biological and social characteristics of mankind was popular
during Crawfurd’s time, which also influenced how global history was
conceptualised.106 The physical traits of the world’s various ethnicities
were explained by the climates of their native lands. In European scientific
circles, it was commonly assumed that Europeans have fairer complexions
because of their confinement to the cold climate of their traditional
homelands, whereas those who inhabit warmer climes have darker
features. It was also widely believed that Europeans would degenerate both
physically and characteristically if they moved beyond the cold confines
of their homelands to warmer ones, as can be seen in Thomson’s view of
history; he, like Crawfurd, was also a British civil servant who served in
the Malay Peninsula:

   *Thus, the Macedonians degenerated on the plains of Babylonia, as<br> 
   the British at the present day on the plains of Hindostani; the New<br> 
   Englanders on the plain of Mississippi; the Portuguese in the Valley<br> 
   of Amazon… the power thus gathered in the middle latitudes is<br> 
   dissipated in the tropics. The power of education is paralysed by the<br> 
   weakening influences of climate. The natural energy is absorbed by<br> 
   contact with the enervating influences of the opposite zone*.107

Thomson’s comment mirrored the opinion of many European writers,
who considered climate to be a cause of the decline of Western empires, after expanding beyond the cold boundaries of their natural abodes.108
Hot weather was also used to explain the immoral practices and laxity of
Europeans living in their tropical colonies, and the term “going native” was
commonly applied to those whose behaviours were seen to have strayed
from the European ideal.109 Warmer climates were, therefore, unsuitable
places for Europeans to live, some believing that it would lead to the loss of
attributes that distinguished their “imperial race”.110

Crawfurd, however, had a different view, one that was confirmed by his
experiences living in Southeast Asia. Using his experience in Singapore as
an example (and probably also from his medical assessment), he found that
there was no reason to believe that the tropical climate was less healthy than
other parts of the world.111 In *History of the Indian Archipelago*, he further
highlighted his observation that Europeans were able to adapt to the climate
of tropical countries and the idea that they degenerated due to the climate
“of the black or copper-coloured races, [was] no better than a prejudice”.112

To him, using climate or sun intensity of a region to identify the physical
makeup of a race made no sense due to the existence of inhabitants in colder
climates who do not share the same features as the Europeans, such as the
Eskimos, who are as dark as the equatorial Malays.113 The Malays are still
fairer than the inhabitants of India who live under similar geographical
conditions as southerners of Europe, and “the Laplanders are much darker
than the Norwegians, although much nearer to the Pole, with less sun”.114

Crawfurd pointed to his observations of the interesting racial composition
of the Malay Peninsula, where the dark Semang in the cooler mountains
and the lighter complexioned Malays in the hot plains could be found, to further demonstrate the impracticability of connecting human features
with temperature.115 Climate, therefore, had no influence over determining
the colour of the different races, and he reasoned that these erroneous
observations arose out of inadequate experience.116

The explanation for the variety of skin colour present in the different races
of mankind was, according to Crawfurd, beyond human comprehension,
just as one cannot explain the different colours found in the same
species of fox.117 Hence, skin colour of the different races would seem to
be a character that was imprinted on humanity from the beginning.118
Crawfurd also questioned the use of skin colour as a means of measuring
racial superiority, noting that the inhabitants of the Indian subcontinent
were darker than the Malays, yet the former were more advanced than the
latter.119 One striking feature of these discussions was Crawfurd’s attack on
European subjectivity:

   *The notion that a fair complexion is the offspring of a cold,<br> 
   and a dark one of a warm climate, is entirely European. Such<br> 
   a fancy could not possibly have originated with any other race<br> 
   of man. The superiority which the White man has always<br> 
   shown, perhaps justifies us in considering a fair complexion the<br> 
   most favourable*.120

Crawfurd’s arguments about skin colour bearing no connection to climate
were related to his broader polygenetic views on ethnology and history.
He believed that, with reasons only known to the Creator, the diverse
human races sprang up independently in different parts of the globe, each
with their own features and languages, just as various species of the same
genus of plants and animals are found across various locations around the 
world.121 One of Crawfurd’s attacks on studies that promoted the idea of
shared human origin, such as Darwin’s, was that it had not identified the
location of that origin.122 He called British physician and ethnologist James
Cowles Prichard’s (1786–1848) theory that the first man and woman were
“black” nothing but a “figment of his own brain”.123 Although there is no
indication in his writings to suggest that he was an atheist, Crawfurd’s stand
on multiple human origins was also in conflict with the Biblical stance on
common human origin.124

#### **Language and Mankind’s Origins**

In his paper reviewing Sir Charles Lyell’s (1797–1875) *Antiquity of Man* that
was read to the Ethnological Society of London in 1863, he pointed out that
Lyell’s theory of the unity of the human race was influenced by Darwin’s
hypothesis of the transmutation of species. Calling it a “monstrous fiction”,
Crawfurd remarked that he could not bring himself to agree with the theory
because it did not account for human diversity, physical and mental, as seen
in the Malays, Chinese, Polynesians, Europeans and so forth.125 Africans
and Europeans, he added, have been planted in almost every climate
of the world “for three hundred years” and have remained unchanged,
unless through intermixture.126 There was, furthermore, no historical or
archaeological evidence to support the hypothesis, and he highlighted that
“the Ethiopian represented on Egyptian paintings four thousand years old is
exactly the Ethiopian of the present day”.127

Another reason for his opposition to Lyell’s idea on human history was also
because of his adoption of German philologist Max Müller’s (1823–1900)
Aryan theory of language to further support his view on the unity of the
human races.128 Müller, whom Crawfurd lauded as “a gentleman of great
learning” whose imagination was “at least equal to his learning”, argued that
the languages of Europe could be traced to Central Asia and, therefore, must
have been brought to Europe through distant migration or conquest.129 This
would suggest that Europeans could trace their ancestry to Central Asia as
well as India and Western Asia, where traces of the Aryan language can be
found and was alleged to have spread.130

Using history as a case in point, Crawfurd questioned how mankind in its
savage state of antiquity could undertake such a remarkable feat of diaspora,
pointing out that they must have first acquired a considerable measure of
civilisation before accomplishing such a task.131 Europeans had only attained
the means of undertaking the discovery of one half of the world only 400
years prior, and it was absurd to think that the same enterprise was expected
to have been accomplished on a massive scale by “rude and savage men”
from a single point of the earth’s surface thousands of years earlier.132

Even the Romans and Greeks during the classical age, with their civilisation,
were not capable of achieving such a grand feat of diaspora.133 Crawfurd
noted that, in spite of this, some writers still argued that “helpless savages,
then, without a stock of food, and without flocks or herds, are represented
as crossing broad seas, or marching over mountains of ice and snow”.134 That
said, one can see why he saw the multiple origins of mankind as the more
sensible explanation to their wide geographical spread around the world.

Crawfurd was against the use of language, as was done by Müller, to trace
common ancestry because it was unreliable and because the concept did
not conform to his polygenetic view. Mankind emerged simultaneously at
different points around the world, speaking a diverse set of languages that
were specific to the locality from which they had sprung. But as societies
advanced, their languages evolved into common combined tongues and
were reduced over time through conquests and cross-cultural engagements
such as commerce and religion.135

Crawfurd explained that this was why more languages can be found
spoken by people in “savage” and isolated regions such as Borneo, and
fewer in more advanced societies such as Britain.136 Some would simply
abandon their native tongue and adopt a more practical one, not unlike
contemporary times, which was another problem he identified with using
language to trace racial origin: “If, then, language were a test of race, we
should be tracing some of the Negros settled in America, first to England
and then to Germany and Italy, and others… to Spain.”137 But there were
exceptions to the rule and language could, at times, be employed to tell the
history of a race, and Crawfurd would argue that the African and “Oriental
Negroes” were not related because, aside from their different features, there
was no connection between their languages, and the same would apply
between the latter and the Malays.138

#### **Polygenesis as a Framework for Understanding the History of the Malay Peninsula**

Polygenesis can be observed in the way Crawfurd conceptualised the
history of the Malay Peninsula. The Malays, he theorised, were one of five
independent civilisations to have sprung up from the well-watered volcanic
portion of Sumatra. This was a geographically ideal location for them to
attain a level of civilisation advancement to effect migration to other parts of the Indian Archipelago, such as Borneo, northern Sumatra, and most
notably the Malay Peninsula – where they were now found settled on the
coasts.139 Thus, they arrived in the region in a comparatively civilised state
in the 12th and 13th centuries, and continued to the present-day to emigrate
from Sumatra.140 The other brown-complexioned “Malay” Aslian tribes such
as the Jakuns, were also migrants from Sumatra, but the darker “Oriental
Negro” tribes, he believed, were in the Malay Peninsula before them.141

Crawfurd noted in *Grammar and Dictionary of the Malay Language*
that unlike others, such as Marsden, Raffles and Baron Wilhelm von
Humboldt (1767–1835), he did not believe that the languages of the Indian
Archipelago, such as the Malay language, were derived from one source as
was generally thought. In his later *A Descriptive Dictionary of the Indian
Islands*, he noted that the Indian Archipelago is home to innumerable
languages.142

Traces of the Malay language, however, can be found in some parts of the
Indian Archipelago, such as the Philippines, but the origin of the Malay
language is obscure.143 Although he mentioned in *Grammar and Dictionary
of the Malay Language* that his different conclusion was due to his advantage
of being favoured with ampler materials than his predecessors, it was also
because this concept of shared language origin, which suggested that the
inhabitants of the Malay Archipelago were “one of the same race”, did not
conform to his idea of polygenesis.144 Crawfurd, citing lack of evidence,
had not always agreed with Marsden that Minangkabau was the homeland
of the Malays, but he eventually surrendered to this view, although he continually reminded his readers that it was only a reasonable hypothesis, as
there was yet to be solid proof to confirm this.145

Returning to Quilty’s *Textual Empires*, if she had included Crawfurd’s later
works in her analysis, she would have seen his ideas about race and language
as more than simply a Malthusian or proto-Social Darwinist view of “a fight
for survival between languages” – where the language of the weaker group is
displaced by the dominant.146 He would have cringed at the notion of being
identified with Darwinism. She would also have observed that Crawfurd’s
idea about the Southeast Asian peasant as a potential proto-capitalist who
could be improved by being in close proximity to the European presence
was part of his broader view that less advanced societies would benefit from
contact with a more advanced one, and it did not have to be the West.147

Although it is true that Crawfurd stated in *History of the Indian Archipelago*
that civilisation of the Asiatic nations may be fairly traced to the European
race, he had a different view in his later publications, acknowledging
that some Asian nations were once ahead of the West.148 If one applies
Crawfurd’s later conception of ethnology to practice, an advanced non-
European nation could have brought civilisation to the savage western and
northern Europeans of antiquity by way of cross-cultural engagement, if
they had been within closer proximity to them than the Romans or Greeks.

People change their minds, and this is a key point for scholars who are
dealing with intellectual history on a broad scale to note. As Knapman has
demonstrated, the misinterpretation of Crawfurd’s work is a warning not to
simplify 19th-century thought.149

#### **Conclusion**

***The Malay Peninsula’s Place in Crawfurd’s Conception of Ethnology and
World History***

The Malay Peninsula and its inhabitants played an imperative role in
Crawfurd’s vast literature and in shaping his views on ethnology and world
history, as with other colonial individuals who travelled to and lived in the
region. They also featured regularly in his scientific arguments on ethnology.
This important connection was admitted by Crawfurd when he noted in his
1861 ethnological article that the Malay Archipelago, where he spent 12 years
of his life, had been the subject of his attention, and he would emphasise
his authority over his subjects and in his arguments on ethnology, history
and languages by pointing to his experiences in the Malay Peninsula and its
surrounding islands.150

He used his observations of the Peranakan communities, for example,
to support his position on the offspring of mixed-racial unions and
dismiss the notion that they would be sterile, and to stress that a union
between a superior and inferior race would produce an intermediate
offspring inferior to the latter and superior to the former. His belief that
the climate had no forbearance in shaping the physical appearance of
mankind and that hot climates were not harmful to Europeans were
drawn from his own experience living in Southeast Asia. He contested the
common perception of laziness that European observers had ascribed to
the inhabitants of the region, stressing that there was no encouragement
for hard work in a society where laws protecting wealth were absent. By
comparing the Malays to the darker but more advanced inhabitants of the
Indian subcontinent, he argued that skin colour could not be used as a
benchmark of racial superiority. It is likely that his perceptions would have
been different had he never visited the region.

Crawfurd applied his ethnological and scientific theories to his
understanding of the Malay Peninsula’s history, and connected its
inhabitants to the rest of mankind to form and advance his ideas on the
history of human origins and progress. The races of the Malay Peninsula,
the Malay and the “Oriental Negro”, were distinguished by their physical features in the same manner as he would differentiate the different races of
mankind worldwide. The Peranakan and other mixed-race communities in
the region were a race of their own.

Racial progress was determined by a combination of biological, geographical
and cultural factors. The Malays were considered more advanced than
the “Oriental Negro” tribes of the Malay Peninsula because their fertile
homeland of Minangkabau, Sumatra, provided their civilisation with the
means to thrive to the extent that it enabled them to expand out of their
homeland to form settlements in other parts of the Indian Archipelago such
as the Malay Peninsula.

The Malays’ contact with Hinduism and later Islam further improved them,
giving them the knowledge of letters. The savage state of the “Oriental
Negroes” was due to their isolation in the interiors of the Malay Peninsula,
with lush forests and mountain ranges acting as barriers to cultural
development. With their isolation from the rest of mankind they could not
benefit from contact with a superior society, unlike the Malays. On the
other hand, Crawfurd did not expect the Malays to progress at the same rate
as the Indians, Chinese and, of course, the West, despite having the same
geographical and cultural advantages for civilisational advancement, because
of what he believed to be their lower intellectual capabilities.

Crawfurd’s conception of the history of the Malay Peninsula fit his
polygenetic interpretation of human history. Mankind emerged at the same
time in different parts of the world and Sumatra was the seat of the Malays.
From there, they obtained the civilisational means that allowed them to
establish themselves in the Malay Peninsula. The “Oriental Negroes” were
already in the Malay Peninsula before the Malays, and hence, there must
have been a race that had sprung up in that region. They not only differed
from the Malays in physical appearance, but also spoke a language that was
wholly different.

Polygenesis also played a role in Crawfurd’s later opposition to the common
belief that the Malay language and others spoken in the Archipelago were
from a common source. Indeed, it was not compatible with his polygenetic
belief that the different races of mankind sprang up in their localities
around the globe with their own languages.


It is clear that Crawfurd was no petty intellectual figure of the 19th
century. As his works were highly regarded and highly read, he would have influenced how others saw the Malay Peninsula and its place in the world.
From a broader perspective, Crawfurd’s writings are an example of how
the Malay Peninsula and its populace were featured in British literature,
and how such writings shaped imperial scientific and historical debates
on mankind. They also demonstrate the importance of cross-cultural
encounters in shaping Western ideas and understanding the world.

This study has, nevertheless, become more than just an examination of
Crawfurd’s ideas about the Malay Peninsula, its inhabitants and their
place in his global views. Crawfurd’s knowledge of the region and the
rest of the Archipelago was not drawn from his personal observations
and experiences alone, but also from studying the findings of his
contemporaries and other secondary literature, particularly in areas where
his knowledge was inadequate. He studied both indigenous and Western
historical accounts and records, as well as corresponded with individuals
in his intellectual network from Europe and Asia where information was
exchanged and obtained.

We must also not forget that some of his knowledge was taken directly
from indigenous sources. Although he was critical about the quality of the
Malays’ historical sources, as with other nations in the Archipelago, he still
included them in his works, and noted that such inadequacies were expected
in societies at that level of civilisation. Understanding how Crawfurd
gathered his knowledge about the Malay Peninsula and treated his
information is not only crucial in providing us with a closer look at how his
ideas about the region and its inhabitants were conceptualised, but also how
Western imperial knowledge of the outside world, a vast global information
network, operated during his time.
