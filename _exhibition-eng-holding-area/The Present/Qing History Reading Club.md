**About**:	To promote public interest in history and Chinese reading, Qing History Society Singapore established its reading club in April 2015, regularly holding reading activities. In addition to the books we discuss, we also use engaging talks, film and television works, and interactive software as advanced and lively methods for our reading sessions, making history less dry and boring. To date, we have held over 60 reading activities, with all books discussed being related to Qing history.
