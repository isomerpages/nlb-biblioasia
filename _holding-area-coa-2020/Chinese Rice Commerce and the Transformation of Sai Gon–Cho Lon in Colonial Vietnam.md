In the mid-19th century, as the French empire began to consolidate its
foothold in Southeast Asia, the Chinese rice trade became the cornerstone
of the colonial economy. On the back of this trade, the port city of Sài Gòn–
Chợ Lớn grew to become a major urban centre and international entrepot,
and by the late 19th century, Indochina was the third-largest global rice
exporter after British Burma and Siam.1 At the heart of this trade were
Chinese migrants, whose transnational mercantile networks provided the
financial scaffolding for French colonial capitalism. Christopher Goscha
characterises this thriving trade as a striking manifestation of “East Asian
modernity at work”, and asserts that along with alcohol monopoly and the
development of the colonial plantation system, “the rice trade constitutes one
of the most important components of the Vietnamese economy to this day”.2

Through the lens of the rice trade, this paper examines the confluence of
Chinese migration and diasporic capitalism in transforming Sài Gòn–Chợ
Lớn in the 1870s into a central trade emporium and prominent colonial
port city crucial to the development of French governance in Vietnam and
Southeast Asia at large. My research relies on both primary and secondary
materials in the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library at the National Library
of Singapore, especially the under-explored Singapore historical newspapers
in the NewspaperSG archive, which offers invaluable insights into southern
Vietnam and its Chinese communities. Eclectic information on the rice
trade and Chinese roles in it extracted from colonial Singapore–era
newspapers sheds new light on our understanding of the scope of this trade’s
influence and the close interactions between Franco-British imperial powers
and Chinese communities in the Nanyang diasporic network. Although the
relevant materials and accounts are relatively fragmented, they show the
presence of Chinese commercial activities and the urbanisation of southern
Vietnam at the height of European colonisation in the region, a testament
to the spread of the Chinese population and their importance as politicoeconomic
contributors across Southeast Asian port cities. Hence, these
sources are more than mere supplements to archival sources in Vietnamese
and French.

#### **A Sketch of Sài Gòn–Chợ Lớn’s Chinese Migration and Its Communities**

Chinese migration to Vietnam and participation in its economy are part of
a larger history of Sino-Vietnamese interaction, conflict and state-building
spanning centuries. In southern Vietnam, the first massive wave of Chinese
migrants came at the fall of the Ming dynasty in 1644. Groups of Ming
loyalists escaping persecution by the Manchu-ruled Qing dynasty settled
down in coastal areas of modern-day Vietnam, including Hội An, Qui
Nhơn, Sài Gòn and Hà Tiên. Under the Nguyễn lords’ open attitude towards
the refugees’ integration and their involvement in commercial trade, the
Chinese population in the south grew quickly, with a rough estimate of
30,000–40,000 people in total in southern Vietnam towards the end of the
18th century.3 These Chinese and their descendants were collectively referred to by the Sino-Vietnamese term, Minh Hương (明香; ming xiang in Chinese,
or literally “Ming incense”, in reference to their ancestry as Ming refugees).4

The fall of the Ming also saw the Chinese become increasingly intertwined
with imperial politics in southern Vietnam. In 1679, 3,000 Chinese
troops, led by two anti-Qing military generals, Trần Thượng Xuyên and
Dương Ngạn Địch, arrived at the central Vietnamese port of Tourane.
This coincided with Nguyễn Hoàng’s near-complete acquisition of the
southeastern and western Transbassac.5 When the two generals pledged
loyalty to the Nguyễn lord and asked for permission to take refuge in
southern Vietnam, they were welcomed with open arms, given the strategic
position of Cochinchina as a key commercial centre in a flourishing
maritime trade network and the Sino-Japanese-Vietnamese alliances from
which the Nguyễn clan drew its power.

In the early 18th century, a Chinese general-in-exile named Mạc Cửu
furthered Nguyễn Hoàng’s imperial ambitions through the conquest of Hà
Tiên, a key southernmost coastal town, at the expense of Cambodia, turning
it into a prosperous and profitable Chinese “colony”.6 Thus, well before the
Tây Sơn Uprising in 1771, Ming-loyalist Chinese had established themselves
in Cochinchina as powerful merchants, mariners, court officials and
military leaders who were accorded with political and economic privileges
that outpaced their Vietnamese counterparts. The fact that both sides of
the Tây Sơn rivalries (1771–1802) – Nguyễn Huệ’s forces and the Nguyễn
lord’s armies – relied heavily on Minh Hương attests to their critical role in
Southern imperial politics.7 The Minh Hương provided critical resources
and support to recruit soldiers and finance military operations.

While their identities became diluted towards the end of this conflict,
their status and influence as an institutionalised “bureaucratic-mercantile
‘minority elite’” did not cease with the new Nguyễn dynasty at the turn of
the 19th century.8 Emperor Gia Long (Nguyễn Ánh) allowed Minh Hương
to be registered as permanent settlers as opposed to itinerant merchants
or sojourners and continued to recognise them as an official minority
within the state. This enabled them to form distinct communities residing
in separate administrative units called Minh Hương Xã or Minh Hương
villages. Members of Minh Hương Xã, classed as ethnic Chinese, enjoyed
reduced taxes and access to official court positions, while being exempted
from mandatory military conscription and forced labour.9

This situation shifted drastically when Gia Long’s son, Emperor Minh
Mạng (r. 1820–41), pursued aggressive policies to assimilate the Chinese into
mainstream Vietnamese society. In 1829, Chinese migrants were banned
from going back to China, and in 1842, they were accorded a different
immigration status from those arriving later – now designated as the
immigrant Chinese (*immigrants chinois*).10

Minh Hương as a category thus began to develop new legal connotations.
Those identified by the imperial court as members of this group now
included anyone of ethnic Chinese descent, including the offspring of
Chinese and Vietnamese intermarriages, i.e. *métisses* or mixed race,
often referred to as Sino-Vietnamese. By joining a Nguyễn-legislated
association of Minh Hương villages, Chinese settlers were encouraged
to interact with local villagers and adopt Vietnamese cultural practices.
For example, Minh Hương children were prohibited from “shaving their
heads and wearing pigtails… and must be registered as a member of the
Minh Hương congregation when they reached eighteen and abandon their
parents’ nationalities”.11

As the Nguyễn polity expanded its territories southward, ongoing
settlements and economic potential in the Mekong Delta presented
numerous opportunities for further Chinese migration. Between 1829 and
1830, just over 1,100 Chinese arrived at the district of Gia Định. From the last two months of 1830 to the first four months of 1831, about 1,640 more settled
in the area.12

Under the Nguyễn dynasty, Chinese migration and settlement were
regulated by a system called *bang*, in which the migrants were categorised
into dialect-based communities. Each *bang* nominated its own head officers
to communicate with the Nguyễn court on political and economic issues.
This system of control was perfected under the French when they nominally
ruled over the southern colony of Cochinchina. The French system, called
*congrégation*, required all Chinese to be registered and taxed based on their
place of origin. By 1871, seven native-place associations were recognised by
colonial law: Canton, Fujian, Hakka, Hainan, Chaozhou (Teochew), Fuzhou
and Quanzhou.13

The French sought to benefit from the pre-existing Chinese economic
networks, including their diasporic trade routes and their competitive advantage over indigenous populations in “rice production, fisheries, and
other staple industries”.14 The Chinese were also valuable intermediaries
who filled the French coloniser’s manpower needs and provided key sources
of income to thicken the colonial budget. For example, the Chineseoperated
opium revenue farms were the financial mainstay of the colonial
bureaucracy.15 But, as Li Tana remarks, “at the heart of Chinese commerce in
Vietnam, the rice trade was the main index of Chinese prosperity”.16 Indeed,
with the emergence of Sài Gòn as a cosmopolitan coastal city and Chợ
Lớn as its adjacent Chinatown, the Chinese came to dominate this prized
segment within the colonial economy of Cochinchina.

#### **Chinese Rice Commerce, Colonial Port City, and the Making of a Trans-regional Trade**

Thomas Engelbert aptly describes the city of Chợ Lớn as the rice capital of
colonial Cochinchina; the existing Chinese social and commercial structures
conducive to efficient business-making, and the rapid urbanisation of Sài
Gòn made Chợ Lớn an important centre of commerce in the Mekong Delta
trading emporium.17 Two intertwined dimensions account for the rise of Sài
Gòn–Chợ Lớn: French colonialism and Chinese economic networks.

French colonialism changed the face of both the formerly waterlogged city
of Sài Gòn and the little town of Chợ Lớn 6 km away. Before the French
conquest in 1859, Sài Gòn was generally described by local imperial officials
as naturally well endowed, having benefited from the rich resources of
the Mekong Delta and its water-based navigational systems. European
visitors, however, viewed it with much doubt and contempt, seeing it as a
swampy area with sporadic commercial exchanges and a bleak future for infrastructural development.18 Decades after French efforts to transform
the region through economic modernisation programmes and public work
projects, however, British observers presented a different opinion, calling
Sài Gòn “the Paris of the East” and “the Pearl of the Orient” as they waxed
lyrical about its exuberant modernity:

   The streets become wider, the houses and shops more resplendent,<br> 
   and further on, as we approach the beautiful cathedral, we come<br> 
   across wide boulevards, and pass beautiful residences of the<br> 
   French inhabitants and fine government buildings… The cost of<br> 
   living in Sài Gòn must be extremely high.19

The city’s bustling commerce was also noted. Some visitors could not help
but compare it to Singapore – then Sài Gòn’s most important trading partner
but also occasional competitor – and admiringly proclaimed it “a progressive
city” and “the future queen of the East”.21 Reporting on the state of
commerce in Sài Gòn–Chợ Lớn with vested interest and wariness, the *Straits
Times* scrupulously cited statistics from its correspondents: “the tonnage
frequenting the port rose from 834,430 tons in 1902 to 1,695,515 tons in 1907”,
and “the volume of trade in imports and exports together shot up from a
value of over 259 million francs in 1902 to nearly 892 million in 1907”.22

Over in Chợ Lớn, the robust Chinese presence and vibrant trading scene
captivated foreign investors. One called it a “veritable Chinese town” in a city
of abundance, where a large number of British traders came in the spring
and winter months to search for rice cargoes, and where “all the large rice
mills – the largest to the east of Singapore” were to be found.23

The so-called modern development of Sài Gòn as a port city began with
intensive hydraulic projects in the 1860s to facilitate colonial control and
access to the more remote parts of the south. A new colonial administration
was put in place to supervise the construction of complex canal networks
connecting the coastal cities to the hinterlands and the waterways of the
Mekong Delta.

According to the Director of the Interior, Paulin Vial, who monitored this
early phase of public works already underway two years prior to the conquest
of Sài Gòn, these projects reshaped the urban geography of the city and
the topography of Cochinchina at large. “Two thousands of workers were
employed from all parts of Cochinchina,” he wrote, “to pull the entire city
out of its muddy state and, most importantly, to stimulate its function as a
port authority with well-operated wharves and smooth-sailing traffic”.24

Specifically for the Cochinchinese rice trade, this period of feverish
construction improved existing waterways, initiated new agricultural zones,
and therefore accommodated rice cultivation by Vietnamese settlers along
these routes. A new canal, Arroyo Chinois (Kênh Tàu Hũ), greatly improved
access to the more distant Transbassac areas. This effectively linked the rural
rice economy of Miền Tây to the rice mills in Chợ Lớn and, via the port of
Sài Gòn, to global rice-export powerhouses such as Hong Kong, Canton,
Singapore, Manila, Bangkok and the Netherlands East Indies.25

This increasing interconnectedness of the international rice markets led
to an exponential growth in exports in Sài Gòn from 1860 to 1919.26 Rice,
alongside pepper, became one of the two major export commodities for
the colonial economy. According to the Sài Gòn Chamber of Commerce,
approximately 58,000 tons of rice were exported to Europe and other
global markets from Sài Gòn in 1860, and from 1865 to 1869, rice prices in
Cochinchina achieved the highest index for export.27 Only seven years later, this number increased more than threefold to about 193,000 tons. From
the 1880s onwards, Cochinchina exported half a million tons annually,
accounting for 80 percent of the total value of southern Vietnam’s exports.28

The unprecedented boom in commercial rice export was supported by the
activities of various Chinese communities in southern Vietnam around
this time – predominantly traders, rice millers and go-between workers
of all kinds, but also financiers and creditors.29 Chinese rice commerce
was organised through an elaborate network of what anthropologist
Clifton Barton characterises as an urban-rural dynamic. It involved the
co-participation of urban rice merchant syndicates (centred on Chợ Lớn)
and village-based Chinese traders, who together forged a link between
Vietnamese rural society and the colonial commercial economy.30 In
addition to their significant contribution to the French colonisation of the
Mekong Delta and its agricultural revolution, Chinese merchants were,
in Barton’s words, “the channel through which much of the credit that
financed these development efforts flowed and the source of the merchandise
that provided the incentives for Vietnamese peasants to produce for the
market economy”.31

The Chinese pioneered rice-grinding technologies that gave their mills an
edge in efficiency. In 1876, the first steam-powered mill in Chợ Lớn was
assembled and popularised by a Chinese merchant there.32 In 1906 and
1907, two large rice mills in Chợ Lớn – Ban Tek Guan and Ban Hong Guan
– struck a deal with the engineering firm Messrs. Riley, Hargreaves and
Co. to provide extensive electrical installation for their mills, and to supply
“the dynamo as well as the other gear”.33 The Singapore-based British firm claimed that their electrical engines would be “more than sufficient to run
over 600 lamps of 16 candle power in addition to several arc lamps”.34

By the late 19th century, the Chinese owned the majority of Cochinchinese
mills. Of the eight rice mills in Sài Gòn–Chợ Lớn, it was believed that five
belonged to Chinese proprietors.35 Nationally, until 1911, Vietnam had a total
of 30 rice mills (23 in Sài Gòn and the six southern provinces, 6 in Tonkin,
and 1 in Tourane); of these, 24 (accounting for 80 percent) were Chineseowned.
In terms of productivity, owing to technological innovations and
sheer numerical advantage over the French, Chinese mills reached an
efficiency level of 500–1,200 tons per day.36

The Chinese compradors in Chợ Lớn also monopolised access to the
coveted young rice grains (*lúa non*) from Vietnamese farmers. Around
December each year, Chợ Lớn’s mills sent out armies of agents to scout the interior of Cochinchina for junks managed by Chinese overseers to
procure paddies. These agents, or “bosses”, served as the most proactive
and persuasive middlemen. Accompanied by local partners, they cultivated
congenial relationships with Vietnamese farmers to buy their crops in the
best condition.

In this way, the Chinese rice merchants of Chợ Lớn built up close
connections with the local farming populations and landlords (*điền chủ*)
and developed in-depth knowledge of the Mekong Delta’s rice-growing
geography. These factors enabled them to purchase grains at preferential
rates by paying the farmers a small deposit (or advance) on an agreed
collecting date with much lower contracted pricing.37 Once a harvest
concluded, the farmers had to honour the contract and sell grains to the
merchants before they were transported to rice mills in the city. As this
cycle continued, the intermediary merchants and rice-mill owners made
the most profits. The Vietnamese farmers found themselves hemmed in by
hefty colonial taxes, the loans’ high interest rates, and lack of transparency
in fluctuating market prices. Consequently, they had no choice but to
keep selling their grains to the Chinese and taking Chinese loans to offset
production costs in order to survive till the next harvest.38 H. L. Jammes,
in *Souvenir du Pays d’Annam*, painted a vivid picture of the Chinese
countryside agents’ operations:

The Chinese grain buyer settles, in the four arms of a river
on a comfortable boat, slinging a bag of piastres in one hand
and a game of *baquan* in the other, patiently waiting for the
customers, resting assured that the “fish will bite the bait”.
As soon as rice starts to turn yellow, Chinese agents march through the villages, baiting the farmers by ringing his bags
of coins… The Chinese is then ready to offer his advances. If
the Annamite is unable to repay loans at maturity, the Chinese
will set a selling price for rice much lower than its real value.
Credit is, for the Chinese, a powerful means of exploiting the
Annamese farmers because they are always short of funds. They
have a compulsory expenditure every year: it is the payment of
their taxes. Chinese creditors are at their disposal to provide
such necessary funds. At the present, the harvest loans granted
to the native through provincial chiefs and guaranteed by the
government are only authorised to allow them, in the event
of a bad harvest, to pay the taxes in arrears. The paperwork
hinders farmers who often prefer to deal with Chinese creditors
despite the 12% monthly interest rate. This is a minimum rate,
recognised by the Annamese law and accepted by the French
Courts in Cochinchina. To dissolve of their debts, augmented
by these fabulous interests, the unfortunate Annamese peasants
must submit their property titles in place of securities that
constitute a mortgage in the hands of the creditor. If the
Annamese do not pay their debt, the Chinese will seize their
harvest at record-low pricing.39
