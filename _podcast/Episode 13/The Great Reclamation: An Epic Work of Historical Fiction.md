[*The Great Reclamation*](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=206018224) is a work of historical fiction set in Singapore that has received rave reviews from the *New Yorker* and the *New York Times*. A love story, it also took five years of serious research into a variety of topics, including land reclamation, the Japanese occupation, and postwar politics in Singapore.
