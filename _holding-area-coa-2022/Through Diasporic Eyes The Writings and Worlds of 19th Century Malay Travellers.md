When we reached the bottom of the ship, I looked around me astonished, astonished, astonished, and no words will suffice, for I saw the magic [<i>hikmat</i>] of those steam machines [<i>pesawat asap</i>]. Six to seven fathoms of space were taken up by them alone! And I saw several people wiping, sweeping, oiling and polishing the iron and brasswork until they gleamed like mirrors. I saw nothing rusty, rough or dented, everything was smooth and shiny.1

                                   — Munshi Abdullah, 1841                        


#### **Introduction**
When Munshi Abdullah (1796–1849) wrote the first Malay account of a steamship in 1841, he rendered a strange metal contraption of pipes, boilers and engines for his audience in terms and imagery they could understand. As the first Malay-authored work to be printed and commercially sold, <i>Cerita Kapal Asap</i> (The Tale of the Steamship) was part of a wider turning point in Malay history: from an era of sail and scribes, into the industrial
civilisation of steam and print.

This essay explores that transition as a mediated process, where a new Malay world was generated as much through reinvention from within as it was by external disruption, primarily European forces. It uses stories about travel to examine how Malays redefined the relationship between the local and foreign. As new technologies of transport and communication accelerated the integration of Southeast Asia into colonial empires, travel
became a means for Europeans to establish their authority over subjugated landscapes and peoples. Prolific studies have examined European travelogues, which began as adventurous accounts about the conquest of indigenous societies, and later reflected the rise in commercial tourism after the opening of the Suez Canal.2 The stock personalities, imagery and settings of Somerset Maugham and Isabella Bird, among many, portrayed
a distinctive colonial style that developed in British Malaya during the late 1800s. More importantly, their imaginative construction of space and place were arguments for European imperialism. As Lily Kong and Victor Savage noted, these works regularly featured the exotic peoples and lush tropics alternately feared and idealised, consistent with Edward Said and David Arnold’s influential theories considering the link between representation
and power.3

Yet the writing of travelogues by local authors expands the range of what journeying and travel writing meant at this time. Namely, that it was not the sole preserve of Europeans who mapped and surveyed static places and cultures. These travelogues affirm the circulation of Asians who thrived despite, but also because of, colonial networks. Beyond being tools of imperialism, the industrial technologies of steam and print were, as James Gelvin and Nile Green argued, “enabling technologies” that allowed Muslim societies to redefine their worlds both materially and conceptually.4 Malays harnessed both, as members of the growing Asian-Islamic community of information and movement. Following Mark Frost, this essay seeks to further illustrate how the expansion of print and maritime communication allowed Malay literati “to explore, to imagine and to define” a modernising Asia.5 With increasing encounters with the unfamiliar, Malays wrote their own accounts to interpret a new world on their own terms. Malay travelogues remain an underused source to describe the
colonial encounter in the 19th-century Malay world.

This essay does not seek to establish the travelogue as a coherent generic form in the Malay world or trace its trajectory of development. The term “travelogue” as used here refers to travel narratives – produced either as singular texts or as episodes within longer accounts – which this essay adopts as an analytical device. While travelogues did not exist as a distinct Malay literary genre, the narrative forms of<i> hikayat</i> (prose sagas) and syair (poetic ballads) were replete with extended accounts of characters wandering and undertaking quests. These episodes of movement and discovery were often central to the structure of the plot, as in the case of <i>Hikayat Awang Sulung Merah Muda</i> (Tale of Awang Sulung Merah Muda), which ends with the hero prince’s triumphant return to his rightful kingdom and romantic union with his beloved. This trope drew upon Javanese literature, especially the tales of Panji that became widely popular in Malay areas. <i>Hikayat Cekel Waneng Pati</i> (Tale of Cekel Waneng Pati), one such Panji-inspired Malay tale, involves a protagonist performing various trials and journeys to win the hand of his love. Another source of inspiration for Malay travel writing was the Perso-Arabic Islamic tradition, which, as will be explored later, found rich expression in early modern works such as <i>Hikayat Hang Tuah</i> (Tale of Hang Tuah).
