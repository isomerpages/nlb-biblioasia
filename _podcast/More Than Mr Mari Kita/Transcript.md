description: Pak Zubir Said (1907–87) gave Singapore its national anthem,
  “Majulah Singapura”, and its official Children’s Day song, “Semoga Bahagia”.
  Working with theatre company Wild Rice, musical director Julian Wong put
  together a critically acclaimed production on the life of Pak Zubir that mixed
  history, music and memory in a moving show that led to sold out performances
  in 2022 and 2024. In this episode, Julian tells us the challenges of
  researching and performing those songs, and reveals if he’s a Swiftie.

<p><strong>Julian <br></strong>For me, the most touching thing was, how his
father at the age of 101, [on] 3 December 1959 – the premiere of what we
know today as the official version of “Majulah Singapura” – Pak Zubir’s
father, Datuk Said, travelled to Singapore and went to the Padang to look
for his son. I mean, they had been estranged from 1928 to 1959 – 31 years.
And after he heard “Majulah Singapura”, he broke down and told his son,
“You were right, I was wrong.” And Pak Zubir said that day was special
to him, not because it was the peak of his career, but because his father
finally forgave him. After knowing that story, when you hear “Majulah Singapura”,
and especially because Pak Zubir said “Majulah Singapura” is a prayer,
you hear it in a totally different light. So that’s why when I did it in
the show, I said, there’s no way I can do a version of “Majulah Singapura”
and sing it.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>You are listening to BiblioAsia+, a podcast
produced by the National Library of Singapore. At BiblioAsia+, we tell
stories about Singapore’s past. Some familiar, others forgotten, all fascinating.</p>
<p>Zubir Said was a composer and musician who gave Singapore its national
anthem “Majulah Singapura”. Because of this, Pak Zubir is sometimes known
as Mr. Mari Kita.</p>
<p>However, calling him Mr. Mari Kita would be selling him short. Pak Zubir
was a prolific composer who penned something like 1,500 songs in his lifetime,
including this song that many Singaporeans probably know.</p>
<p>[“Semoga Bahagia playing”]</p>
<p>Julian Wong, a composer, arranger, music director and performer, wrote <em>Don’t Call Him Mr. Mari Kita</em>,
a play about Zubir Said’s life and music. Directed by Ivan Heng, the founding
artistic director of Wild Rice, this play first ran in 2022 and again in
2024, both times to sold-out crowds and critical acclaim.</p>
<p>Julian is a graduate of Berklee College of Music and was given the Young
Artist Award by the NAC [National Arts Council] in 2023 for his contribution
to Singapore music. In addition to all this, he also teaches music and
singing at ITE. <em>Selamat petang</em>, Julian. <em>Selamat datang ka podcast BiblioAsia+. Apa kabar?</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong><em>Kabar baik, terima kasih</em>, Jimmy. Thank
you for having me here.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Thank you for also switching to English because
I think I’ve just about exhausted my Malay. This is after 12 years of studying
Malay in school. So, I apologise to everyone for that. Julian, congratulations
on the terrific run of <em>Don’t Call Him Mr. Mari Kita</em>. I watched
it twice. I watched it once with my wife and I was so blown away I said
my daughter has to watch this.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>Oh, so you came back a second time with your
daughter?</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Came back a second time with my daughter and
both times I ended up tearing up and she was looking at me like, “Hmm,
what’s wrong with you?” You know? So, really blown away, right? Great music.
Great performance. You, as well as the cast, and I also learnt a lot. But
I really want to know, how did this all come about?</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>2019 was going to be the Singapore Bicentennial
year. So, Beatrice Chia-Richmond, she reached out to me because there was
a request from the Bicentennial office and they wanted to do a free concert,
a half hour concert to spotlight the works of Zubir Said.</p>
<p>Beatrice was directing this Light to Night festival. And she reached out
to me and she said, “I have no idea if you might be interested in this,
but I just have a feeling this might be up your alley. So have a think
about it and let me know whether you want to take this on.”</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Was she the one who proposed the idea of doing
something with Zubir Said?</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>Yes. So, I said yes because I knew that Zubir
Said was Iskandar’s teacher and, at that time, Iskandar had passed away
four or five years [prior], and I thought it was a fantastic opportunity
to pay tribute to him, to remember him.</p>
<p>But I didn’t know much about Zubir Said, I only knew three songs – “Majulah
Singapura”, “Semoga Bahagia” and “Sayang Disayang”.</p>
<p>So, I started doing the research. And then I became so fascinated with
this man and I had so much material that she said, “No, no, no, you have
to cut it down. We only have half an hour and this is a free concert.”
So, I did my best. And then my friend Ivan, the founding artistic director
of Wild Rice, came to watch my performance at the National Gallery.</p>
<p>And after the show, he said, “We’re in the throes of building our new
theatre in Funan. And when that is done, would you work with me to flesh
this piece out into a full-length piece and then we can incorporate all
the other things you have done research about, work with a dramaturg, really
make it a production that is special to Singapore?”</p>
<p>So, very thankful for both Beatrice and Ivan.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>So, you mean you’d already done all the research
prior to your 30-minute concert? Or most of your research prior to that?</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>Yeah, I would say 70 percent.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Wow.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>Yeah. But you see, the research for that 30-minute
concert was mostly through reading Dr. Rohana Zubir’s biography of her
father.</p>
<p>By that time, I had also found the first edition of <em>Lagu Lagu Kita</em>,
for which Pak Zubir had written the foreword. I think that was 1981. A
collection of songs written for primary school children. I also found in
the library <em>Zubir Said: His Songs</em>, which was a collection of transcriptions.
In the show, I talk about how in 1982, five years before he passed away,
the Culture Ministry said, “Okay, for those of you who know his songs [and]
have sung them before, please come to the ministry and sing it to us. We
will record and transcribe for you.”</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>That was such an amazing story when I heard
it. How many songs came out of that?</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>It was a thin volume, maybe about 30 songs.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Still, so just 30 songs that no one had heard
of before.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>Yes. Pak Zubir himself didn’t keep his music
and he said people didn’t think it was valuable, so he even sold his scores
to the <em>karang guni</em>, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Oh, that’s so painful.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>It was very painful to read. So, this book, <em>Zubir Said: His Songs</em>,
I had gone through every single song. And it was such a great effort, but
because it was, I guess, people sending in tape recordings of themselves
or coming into the space and singing and then transcribing. So, they didn’t
always make musical sense.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Okay. It’s like when I sing.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>So, part of the process was to go through each
transcription and see which ones made the most musical coherence, you know,
and there were some that I couldn’t use because I just felt it was a bit
too dodgy. And then where there were rare recordings, then I could cross
reference to see, was this transcription correct or not?</p>
<p>So I had done that research when I started working on it with Ivan, and
I was very lucky also to have Alfian Sa’at as the dramaturg, who, because
of his access to the language and the history and the culture, he was able
to, you know, ask me to consider things in a more nuanced way, give me
a little bit more insight.</p>
<p>And then He Shuming, my multimedia designer, he mined the archives for
some of the Cathay and Shaw Brothers films. At that time, because the Esplanade
library was still around, so I bought that, which we then scanned and used
as a projection during the show. So, there was an investment, but that
process was very fascinating.</p>
<p>That was when the stories about “Majulah Singapura” and him being asked
to write the anthem for Malaysia also. That’s how I got to know so much
more through that research.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Okay. And I think Wild Rice had two runs, right?<em> Don’t Call Him Mr. Mari Kita.</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>It’s a very storied history.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Okay. Now I want to hear about it. I want to
hear about it.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>Okay. In 2021, we had our photoshoot, and we
were slated to open in August for two and a half weeks. And then because
of the different safety management measures...</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>During COVID, right?</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>Yeah. It was five in a group, two in a group,
and then no performances. So, we went from two and a half weeks to two
weeks, to one week, to no show in 2021. But we managed to do it as a fundraiser
for Wild Rice.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Okay. In 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>Yes. Over three nights. And just from those
three nights alone. So, like, Mr. Jeremy Monteiro came and then he bought
out a night for his friends and colleagues.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>He bought out a night?</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>Yeah. I remember I was just so grateful for
the kindness.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Right. But it was tremendous. So, what happened
after that?</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>And then, word started to build about the production
when we came back in 2022. People were really waiting to watch it. But
then I had COVID. After it opened, and it was very significant because
Dr. Rohana Zubir, who was well at that time, flew to Singapore for our
gala opening.</p>
<p>And so, we opened that day. The next day I did two shows on Saturday,
and then I tested positive for COVID. So, then we had to cancel the next
whole week.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Did Dr. Rohana manage to watch it though?</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>Yes, she did.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Julian</strong>
</p>
<p>Yeah. So, we had to cancel one whole week and come back for a few more
shows only. So, when we finally got to do it again this year, we crossed
all our fingers and toes. And thankfully we did a full month without any
incident. So very grateful for that.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>I’m pretty sure you guys were sold out because
it was such an amazing performance.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>Thank you so much. In the last week, we had
to open standing room tickets.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Wow.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>And I thought, who’s going to come and stand
and watch me talk and sing for one and a half hours. But yeah, there were
people.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>I want to thank you for putting it all together
because when I watched it, I was really moved by what you’d uncovered,
and the music was wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>That is all credit to Pak Zubir.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Sure, of course. And I want to say that your
version of “Semoga Bahagia”, the Children’s Day song, I remember as a kid
it was more like a marching tune, you know, and your version was actually
quite nice.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>You know, there’s a thing about Pak Zubir's
music as I studied it. It is so chromatic. It is very difficult to harmonise.
But when you get it, you can see what he had in mind. In the years that
we’ve learned it or the versions that we’ve known, it has never been...</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>We’ve butchered it.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>Butchered is a strong word. So musically to
me, this might be a technicality. There are signposts in his melody that
very obviously tell me, okay, he wants to go to the dominant here, or this
has to be harmonised with a certain chord because of the note he’s chosen.</p>
<p>But those intricacies, I don’t hear very often. So, I stripped everything
bare and started from scratch. I mean, yes, it is also my aesthetic, my
taste, but I tried very hard to always keep in mind what he would have
wanted to convey. I think he said, do not change a note, don’t make it
flowery because every note has a meaning. So, I tried to be very respectful
of that.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Well, I have to say, I’d never heard a more
beautiful version of “Semoga Bahagia” before, and mainly because, maybe
other people didn’t butcher it, but I certainly did.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>But the lyrics, right?</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>The lyrics, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>I mean, growing up, I never knew the significance
of what the song was saying. I sang it too, and I just knew it as <em>sama-sama</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>And then when you take a step back and you
realise this is actually a manifesto for life.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Yeah. The other thing I wanted to say is that,
and obviously a lot of the music was in Malay, right?</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>All!</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>All, all the music was in Malay. And it was
beautifully done with you and, of course, the very talented cast that you
have.</p>
<p>I was listening to it and thinking, wow, I wish I could understand it
more. I wish I didn’t have to squint at the subtitles to understand what
was going on. But even when I didn’t have to, when I closed my eyes, I
could just be swept away by the music.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>Yeah, there were audience members who told
me after a while they stopped looking at the subtitles. They felt that
they didn’t need it after all. Because the music itself carried so much
emotion and meaning.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Hmm. You know, in that whole research process,
what were some of the harder things that you had to uncover or that they
had to do?</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>Musically, the painstaking process of finding
the transcriptions was number one. And sometimes they were not neatly compiled,
like in the two books that I found. Sometimes they were little photographs
that Dr. Rohana took and put it in her book.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Oh!</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>So I’m like, that’s his handwriting. Okay.
Then I bring it to the library and I magnify it. Okay. This is a song about
his granddaughter. Let’s try it out. And then, because most of the transcriptions
do not have an accompaniment and all the recordings are lost, you don’t
know how it actually sounded like in the day. So, the difficult part is
to then harmonise everything and create all the accompaniment on my own.
In some ways, it’s quite freeing because you have no reference.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Right.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>But on the other hand, it’s also being very
mindful of respecting the composer’s work.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>What's the most interesting thing you learned
about Pak Zubir from your research?</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>I think the most interesting thing to me, and
I didn't know this until I researched about him, was that he was not Singaporean.
That he was actually an outsider.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>From Sumatra, right?</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>From Bukit Tinggi. Yes. And that he had come
here to Singapore as a way of rebelling against his father. His father
was the village chief, the <em>penghulu</em>, and who didn’t allow him to
pursue music because music was <em>haram</em>. And so, when he was 21 years
old, Pak Zubir fell very ill and had to be in the hospital for one and
a half months.</p>
<p>I say hospital, but it was really a shed <em>lah,</em> a shed that was far
away from his hometown. And his father couldn’t be with him in the hospital.
So, the father took him to the hospital and gave the doctor the white cloth,
the shroud, his shroud, and said, “If my son dies, please bury him in this.
If my son lives, please tell him to come home.”</p>
<p>So, after one and a half months, miraculously Pak Zubir recovered and
then he thought life was too short to stay in Bukit Tinggi. So, he walked
and took a horse cart to Pekanbaru and then took a ferry to Singapore because
a friend of his told him, “You want to be a musician? Singapore might be
a better place.”</p>
<p>And he took that shroud and used it as a towel. Yeah. Just the shirt on
his back and that shroud. It’s just an amazing story.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>It was an amazing story.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>And when he came here, he worked as a violinist
first with the Bangsawan Theatre Companies. And then he learned how to
read Western music notation – became the arranger, the conductor, music
director.</p>
<p>And then when his father found him, he wrote to him and said please come
back home. I think it was the general’s daughter wants to marry you, a
Dutch officer’s daughter wants to marry you. You can come back and lead
a good life. Just marry her. And he wrote back to his father saying “but
marrying a non-Muslim is <em>haram</em>”. Used his father’s words against
him.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Oh, wow. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>And then he made such a name for himself. And
of course, went through a terrible time in the war, but, you know, brought
up his family here. And for me, the most touching thing was, how his father
at the age of 101—</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Tell us that story.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>3 December 1959 – the premiere of what we know
today as the official version of “Majulah Singapura” – Pak Zubir’s father,
Datuk Said, travelled to Singapore and went to the Padang to look for his
son. I mean, they had been estranged from 1928 to 1959 – 31 years. And
after he heard “Majulah Singapura”, he broke down and told his son, “You
were right. I was wrong.” And Pak Zubir said that day was special to him,
not because it was the peak of his career, but because his father finally
forgave him.</p>
<p>After knowing that story, when you hear “Majulah Singapura”, and especially
because Pak Zubir said “Majulah Singapura” is a prayer, you hear it in
a totally different light. So that’s why when I did it in the show, there
was no way I could do a version of “Majulah Singapura” and sing it.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>No, it’s just weird, right? It would be weird
to do it in the theatre.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>So what would be the best way? And I thought,
he said it is a prayer. So, let’s do it quietly in a very personal way.
Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Yeah, so I’m glad nobody stood up to sing. But
it was lovely just to be able to sit down and have the strains of “Majulah
Singapura” wash over you.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>You know, I’m, till today, I am so surprised
by the reaction of the audience because truth be told, when we first got
the publicity audition in 2021 we didn’t know if anybody would come.</p>
<p>It was the title, <em>Mr. Mari Kita</em>, Zubir Said, and then who’s this
guy Julian Wong? And then it was COVID, right? So, we really weren’t selling
tickets. It’s just as well that the run got cancelled, you know? So, when
we opened, we didn’t know what the reaction would be. And certainly did
not expect it to be this warm. This reception has been so warm.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>I had a wonderful evening. Credit also to the
cast members on the show. The musicians, of course. But tell me a little
bit about the singers. Three of them are your former students, right?</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>That's right, yeah. Malcolm, Hani and Hannah.
And Hannah did the very first one with me at the National Gallery as well.
So, the singers were all old students of mine from ITE, and they have all
gone on to different fields. Hannah is a graphic designer, Malcolm is hoping
to go to music school and Hani is now pursuing her career in theatre. So,
it’s very nice that they gave me face and said, “Okay <em>lah, </em>we do
this with you”.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>No, but it all worked, right? Because they have
such wonderful voices. And it worked with what you did. And I was really,
you know – I can’t say too many times – I was really blown away.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>Thank you. I think what Ivan saw in the show
was the act of passing down knowledge, which is the first line of [“Semoga
Bahagia”]: <em>Sama-same maju ke hadapan Pandai cari pelajaran</em>. And
because I talk about my teacher and the show is about his teacher and I
share the stage with my students, he’s always told me that was very powerful
to him. And I never thought of it that way.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>I want to talk about a little bit about “Majulah
Singapura”. Because he was commissioned to do that, right? But was it very
much in his own, like, normal style?</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>I think he took pains to make it very simple
so that people would be able to sing along. I read an article about how
he chose the words of the anthem so that it is not about a king, it is
not about a monarch, it is about the people of <em>Rakyat Singapura</em> and
the values that he imbued the anthem with.</p>
<p>And he was very specific about the number of syllables in a line, I think.
His original version in 1958 was much longer. It was written to commemorate
the opening of the renovated Victoria Theatre and was much more complex
musically. I sing a little bit of it in the show. There’s an extended verse
before you go into <em>marilah kita bersatu</em>.</p>
<p>So, in 1959, the legislative assembly thought: this would be a good song
as our national symbol, our national anthem. But we need to make it simpler.
So they went back to Pak Zubir, who then adjusted it to the version that
we know today.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>And I understand also that it’s since been taken
down like a key.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>Yeah, I believe when I was in primary school,
we sang it in G and then there was a year where they brought it down to
F. It’s still very high for a lot of kids.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Well, I’m not sure if they’re actually singing
it. It’s like mouthing it. You think it's still very high at E?</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>Yeah. If you’re a girl, you would have to be
a soprano to reach those notes. You see? So, I’ve always felt that it should
be taken even lower.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Wow. Okay. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>Maybe to D major.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>What did you think of that more melancholic
version that was done by… what’s his name?</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>Datuk Ramli. Very interesting take on it. But
I think over the years there have been so many versions of “Majulah Singapura”
and “Semoga Bahagia”.</p>
<p>They’ve always shined a spotlight on an arranger, or an artist or a band,
you know, but I never felt that they were giving Pak Zubir’s music and
lyrics its due and the weight that it deserved.</p>
<p>That’s why even in my arranging of “Majulah Singapura” and “Semoga Bahagia”,
I never changed a note or a word or even put in an embellishment, because
it was something he said expressly – do not embellish.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>So you mean the version that we heard of “Semoga
Bahagia” is as he would have?</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>The melody is note for note.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Wow. And because it was, it’s so melancholic.
It’s so quiet.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>Note for note. But, of course, the orchestration
of it, what the musicians play is my invention.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>And certainly the very quiet version of “Majulah
Singapura” is also, you know, when you strip it out, it’s very beautiful.
It’s not pompous.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>Yeah, it’s interesting because, like I said,
Pak Zubir said he wrote “Majulah Singapura” as a prayer, a prayer for the
progress of the nation and unity of its people. But I suppose, every anthem
has to fall into that box of being a march and for the military band to
play and conjure feelings of patriotism, right?</p>
<p>So, I took that away and then I thought, okay, if he says a prayer, how
do we make this sound like a prayer? And Ivan was also… I think that was
the only song where he said, let’s completely turn the house lights down
so that for every audience member, it’s a personal moment for them. They
don’t need to worry. They won’t see the reaction of the person next to
them or opposite them in the theatre. So yeah, he really understood it
too.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>That’s wonderful. You know, Zubir was the teacher
of your teacher, you know, Iskandar Ismail. So, what did you hear about
Pak Zubir from Iskandar Ismail?</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>So Mr. Iskandar was a blazing talent and he
could play anything and everything by ear.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Wow.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>And this talent was there in his whole family,
actually, since he was a kid. Iskandar’s mother was the late Nona Asiah,
who was Pak Zubir’s muse, and he wrote so many songs for her. And Nona
Asiah was also the playback singer in a lot of his movies, the Cathay films
and the Shaw Brothers films.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Nona Asiah sent Iskandar, her eldest son, to
Pak Zubir for lessons because she wanted him to learn the piano, learn
music properly, rather than just by ear.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>Yes. So, Iskandar told me he hated it because
he had all this talent, right? He was ready to go, he could play anything,
but Pak Zubir was such a strict disciplinarian.</p>
<p>It’s like the cane-the-knuckles, pull-the-ear type, must practice and
play scales. And Pak Zubir knew when Iskandar was faking it and improvising
and playing by ear. And he would insist that Iskandar read note for note
and play note for note the score. So, I think he took some of the classical
piano exams under Pak Zubir.</p>
<p>But after that, Iskandar told me how much he realised it was necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Why? Why was it necessary?</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>Fundamental training for him to acquire that
discipline to read music that would then enable him to do all the work
he did in his career and not just play by ear.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Yeah, yeah, of course, obviously he’s talented,
but obviously you have to be able to read music at some point and to reproduce
those notes.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>In fact, I think either in Dr. Rohana’s biography
or in Iskandar’s biography, there is a Christmas card, I think, that Iskandar
sent to Pak Zubir when Iskandar was at Berkelee College of Music thanking
him for being his first music teacher and instilling that discipline.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Actually, you had in your play a lovely story
about how Iskandar helped you apply for Berklee?</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>Yeah. He insisted that I went to his alma mater,
and at the time I was working with him. But I was, I always, I’m, I’m not
good enough. And, you know, I have no money to go anyway. And then he says,
just apply, just apply. And I remember we were working on a project at
that time and he gave me some time off. He said, go down the road and mail
your application at the post office and then come back.</p>
<p>He made sure I got it done. And then when I was in Boston, he continued
to give me work. I didn’t understand why he felt it was so urgent and so
necessary for me to go to Berkelee until towards the end of my studies,
I realised he had known he was at the end of his life.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>How old was he by then?</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>He was 56, I think.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Oh, he’s very young.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>So end of 2010, he insisted I send in my application.
He had already been diagnosed with cancer. But he went for treatment and
beat it into remission. And then by 2012, I think it came back with a vengeance.
I remember thinking, why has he stopped replying my emails? And then in
2013, when I came back, I got a call from his wife and she said, “Could
you come to the house?”</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>You were back in Singapore already?</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>Yeah. I returned end of 2013, and that was
when I saw that Iskandar had already been bedridden. And so, I came back
in December 2013, we had 11 more months together, and then he passed 2014
November, so it’s been exactly 10 years.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Wow.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>Yeah, so that’s why it’s been very special
to do this most recent run of <em>Don’t Call Him Mr. Mari Kita</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>It’s amazing to hear this. And I think also,
you talk about passing it on, and that’s really what you’re doing as well
in your day job when you’re not winning awards.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>I try. I try my best.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>I have four children who have gone to ITE [Institute
of Technical Education], so I’m very grateful that ITE exists. But I never
knew that ITE had a course on music, because certainly my children did
not attend it.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>So, there is a higher NITEC course called Performance
Production, and these students are training to be stage managers and technicians
and lighting operators and sound designers.</p>
<p>I’m with the Centre for Music and the Arts, and we run five groups that
any student from the three ITEs can participate in. So, I take care of
the two choirs – the show choir and the acapella group. And then we have
the concert band, the modern dance group, the theatrical ensemble as well.</p>
<p>And for me, it’s not about, grooming musicians or artists but letting
them enjoy the arts and sing. I think the arts can enrich them in a way,
you know, they take away lessons from their arts experience that they bring
into their lives.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Really? Like what?</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>Like being on time, discipline, working with
a team, learning how to negotiate and plan their time well. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Yeah. Okay. That's very important. And plus
musicians are not necessarily well known for being on time.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>It depends on what type of musicians. I think
if you are an orchestral musician, I mean, timing is number one. It is
written in your contract.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Oh, really? Okay. Thank God I’m not an orchestral
musician. I also wanted to ask you, what are your plans now? The NAC’s
given you the Young Artist Award, right? So how did that change your life?</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>Not very much.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Nobody came running after you asking for your
autograph?</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>No, I mean, I spend most of my time in ITE
with teenagers and they are very unimpressed.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>So it has never come up.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>All right. “Eh cher, you win award ah, cher.”</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>No, they don’t even, I don’t know if they are
even aware.</p>
<p>No, but you know the work that I do outside, and with the blessing of
my superiors, the work that I do outside really feeds me, and I find the
award has given me some funding to prepare for the next projects that I’m
very interested to do.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>I think Singapore is very fortunate that you
are doing all these things. And I look forward to all the future exciting
things that you’re working on. I think I asked you before we started the
show, you know, are we ever going to see <em>Don’t Call Him Mr. Mari Kita</em> again?</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>I wouldn’t rule out the possibility, but I
think me and Ivan, we are waiting for the right time, the right occasion,
the right cause to bring it back.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>SG60. Maybe, maybe not.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>I’m a patriotic person. I love Singapore, but
there’s something about the National Day celebrations that don’t quite
sit well with me. And I think one of the things that fuelled me to create <em>Don’t Call Him Mr. Mari Kita</em> is
that it showed me that it’s okay. There’s another way. There are other
ways to love your country.</p>
<p>So, when people see it and they tell me it resonates so much with them
and they felt so Singaporean, I’m very, very happy to hear that.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Okay. So, at this point in the interview, we
normally just sort of turn to more so-called light-hearted topics. What
is your favourite song from the musical? Oh, actually, can we actually
call it a musical? Because it’s not really a musical, is it?</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>How would you describe it? I would struggle.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>It’s like a... we all struggle with giving
it a label. Is it documentary musical, documentary concert, musical review?</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Right.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>In the end, is it theatre or is it music? Is
it both? In the end, I think it’s just its own thing.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Okay. What’s your favourite song from its own
thing?</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>Okay. So, this run, I had a new song. It’s
called “Sepasang Bayang-Bayang” (A Pair of Shadows). And how I came to
discover this song is very... it was like providence. It just fell into
my lap from the sky. So, after the run in 2022, I went over to my friend’s
place for Christmas. Karen and Swee Chong.</p>
<p>And Swee Chong is an avid vinyl record collector, full of vinyl records.
And then he said, “Hey Julian, someone was selling off all his old vinyl
records for S$2. I just took the whole lot and I saw some of them had Zubir
Said’s name on the record sleeve.” So, I was looking at his collection
and I realised it was the soundtrack to a lost film in 1950, called <em>Pelangi</em> (Rainbow).
And the singer was Iskandar’s mother.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Oh wow.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>Acting opposite her was Iskandar’s father,
Kassim Ismail.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Wow.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>I had heard of <em>Pelangi</em> before, but it
was one of those [films] categorised as lost. And there were many parts
because the vinyl record is one song per side. I think there were four
songs or six songs. So, there were three [records]. I told my friend, can
you just play this one for me? This one sounds like the love duet. And
it has haunted me ever since because it is a song about lovers who cannot
be together and very, very touching. I told Ivan, “We have to do it to
do this for this front.”&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Is that on the album?</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>Yes. So, we recorded it as a single this year,
and we’ve put it up.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Okay, fantastic. I'll go back and relisten to
it. Can you give us – all your fans, fanboys and fangirls – an idea of
what you’re working on now?</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>I’m working on a few things, but I’m not at
liberty to say what they are. But most recent one, I’m working with the
Esplanade on the Kalaa Utsavam Indian Festival of Arts.</p>
<p>I’m working with a Carnatic music and jazz fusion band called RaghaJazz.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Oh, cool.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>They’re celebrating their 15-year anniversary,
all local musicians. So, I’m helping them as an artistic advisor consultant
to put the concert together.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>What is your background in Carnatic music?</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>I learned on the job – in 2015 I was the music
director for the opening of the Singapore International Festival of Arts.
And it was Madam Goh Lay Kua’s dance epic piece. And she had asked me to
be the music director. As part of that process, I had to go to Bhaskar’s
Arts Academy to learn Carnatic music because the first act of that dance
piece was Bharatanatyam. So now working with Ragha, I get to build on that.
It is a baffling, fascinating art form, and I feel I’ve only skimmed the
surface.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>It must be very exciting though.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>Yes, yes. Very exciting. Very mathematical
too, but very emotional.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Okay. Okay. That sounds very exciting. Who is
your favourite musician?</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>I think for his legacy and also the personal
impact he’s had on me, I would have to say the late Mr. Iskandar Ismail.
Because I remember when I was 10, watching him conduct for the first time
in the orchestra pit.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>You were watching him on TV?</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>No, I was in the children’s ensemble of a musical
called <em>Chang &amp; Eng</em> at the old Victoria Theatre, and he was the
conductor and we had struck a rapport. He said, “Yeah, come to the orchestra
pit when you’re not on stage and yeah, you can observe.” And he gave me
piano lessons at the side.</p>
<p>And when he conducted and I heard the orchestra play, I just had goosebumps.
And I remember thinking, this man wrote and orchestrated every note on
his own. It was unheard of to me. He was always my inspiration. And then
growing up, I saw him work with so many different types of musicians and
in different genres, right?</p>
<p>The classical Indian, the classical orchestras, the pop stars, the musical
theatre, the Malay orchestras, like, I don’t know any other musician who
is that diverse and all-embracing. So, he’s always been an inspiration.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>You’re approaching that. But this is the most
important question that everybody really wants to know. Are you a Taylor
Swift fan?</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>I don’t actually know much of her music except
for –</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Heresy! Get out of here! Get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>Are you? Are you a Swiftie?</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>I attended her concert.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>But my students love Taylor Swift, so I know
her latest hits based on what they tell me. I think one of the things that
made me so determined to do work like <em>Don’t Call Him Mr. Mari Kita</em>,
like this year especially, is there was a period of time early this year
where the national conversation was: how do we bring all these foreign
superstars in?</p>
<p>And my friend took a picture of a minister’s dialogue. How do we make
Singapore more attractive to foreign superstars or something like that?
I’m like, actually, we have our own music and our own art too. If you go
to America, the number one artist is American. You go to Taiwan, the number
one artist is Taiwanese. And I think in Singapore, it’s high time we support
and celebrate our artists and our heritage so much more.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Wow, I couldn’t agree more. Julian, <em>saya ingin mengucapkan terima kasih sekali lagi kerana sudi datang ke podcast kami. Saya harap apa yang Julian telah kongsikan hari ini memberi Mafaat kepada semua pendengar. Terima kasih, Daun Keladi. Kalau diizin, kita jumpa lagi</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong><em>Sama sama dan terima kasih banyak</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>And for all those, including myself, who don’t
know what that meant, I was just thanking Julian for coming on this show.
And I hope that what Julian shared today will be useful to listeners. It’s
really been a pleasure and a privilege to have you on the show.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>Thank you for reaching out to me.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>I want to thank everyone for listening to this
episode of BiblioAsia+. <em>BiblioAsia</em> can be found online at <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg</a>.
And I want to leave you with this haunting version of “Semoga Bahagia”,
written and sung by Julian, accompanied by the cast of <em>Don’t Call Him Mr. Mari Kita</em>.
And thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>Julian<br></strong>Thank you.</p>
