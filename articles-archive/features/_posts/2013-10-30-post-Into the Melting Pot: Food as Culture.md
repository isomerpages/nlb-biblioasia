According to chinese folklore, the four corners of the sky collapsed onto itself after a fierce battle between the gods of water and fire. The Chinese Goddess Nuwa tempered five-coloured stones to mend the sky, then cut off the feet of a great but luckless turtle, whose formidable appendages were used as struts to hold up the firmament.

Her work done, Nuwa grew restless and a little lonely, so on the first day, she created chickens to keep her company. On the second day, she created dogs, followed by sheep on the third, pigs on the fourth, cows on the fifth and horses on the sixth. On the seventh day, Nuwa folded up the sleeves of her robes and fashioned human beings from yellow clay, sculpting each one carefully. She was fatigued — and a little impatient — after creating hundreds of such figures in this manner, so she dipped a rope in the clay and flicked it so that blobs of clay landed everywhere. The handcrafted figures became nobles, while the blobs turned into commoners.

This seventh day falls on *zhengyue*, the first month of the Chinese calendar and is known as *renri* (literally Human Day) — the birthday of mankind. *Renri* also coincides with the seventh day of the Chinese Lunar New Year.

On *renri*, Singaporeans and Malaysians of Chinese descent celebrate their universal birthday by eating *yu sheng* — more popularly known as *yee sang* in Malaysia — a peculiarly local practice of eating raw fish salad (see text box) that traces its history back to the 1960s.

#### A lucky dish of fish 

Fortune or luck is a great arbiter in Chinese culture and the Chinese are unabashed in their pointed preference for material wealth. The longing for instant prosperity and wealth is underscored in the *lo hei* exercise, with its broad tossing and sweeping gestures.

One of Singapore’s most renowned cooks, Chef Sin Leong, recalls how upset his diners were when in the early days the dish of *yu sheng* was tossed by the chefs in the kitchen before it was served. “They said we were taking away their good fortune, so they would rather toss it themselves!”

The performatory ritual of ushering in wealth is only symbolical; more importantly, eating in ritual contexts can also reaffirm relationships with other people.1 The communal partaking of *yu sheng* is perhaps the closest thing the Chinese, known for their usually reserved natures, ever come to "dancing like no one is watching" as a family over food. 

#### Food as a form of culture 

The department of anthropology at Oregon State University defines culture as "learned patterns of behaviour and thought that help a group adapt to its surroundings".2 Culinary culture is central to diasporic identification, with the focus on the place of food in society, more specifically in the enduring habits, rituals and daily practices that are collectively used to create and sustain a shared sense of cultural identity.

To this end, restaurateur, chef and F&B consultant, David Yip, hopes to reinvigorate cultural identity across the Chinese dialect groups in Singapore with his epicurean club Jumping Tables, a sporadic and informal culinary gathering that features respected chefs whipping up time-honoured recipes the traditional way. Yip invites a number of chefs – from humble eateries to established restaurants – to cook at these gatherings.

One of the chefs Yip was most eager to feature at Jumping Tables was Chef Sin Leong, one of the founding chefs of Red Star restaurant in Chin Swee Road and owner of the now defunct Sin Leong Restaurant, a local institution in Cantonese cuisine that first opened in 1971. When Sin, 86, agreed to participate in Jumping Tables, Yip and his guests could barely contain their excitement.

Before the meal commenced, Chef Sin insisted that the guests visit the altar he keeps in his kitchen, where his mentor, the late Master Luo Cheng, smiles out of an ornate frame, amid offerings of orchid blooms and clouds of incense. Hailing from Shanghai, China, Master Luo groomed Singapore's four most prominent Chinese chefs in the 1970s. His protégés, Sin Leong, Hooi Kok Wai, Tham Yui Kai and Lau Yoke Pui, were lat¬er crowned as Singapore's "Four Heavenly Culinary Kings".

Under the tutelage of Master Luo, the four young junior chefs toiled in the kitchen under his stern eye and exacting standards at the famed Cathay Restaurant (at the old Cathay Building). Opened in 1940, it initially served European fare, but underwent a revamp in 1951 under Master Luo to become the finest Chinese restaurant in Singapore, specialising in Cantonese cuisine. The Cathay Restaurant closed in December 1964 and reopened under a new management at the renovated Cathay Building in 2007.

Chef Hooi, the founder of the famed Dragon Phoenix restaurant - located today at Novotel Clarke Quay at River Valley Road – remembers Master Luo as being very strict, not only making them sharpen their culinary skills but also inculcating in them good work ethics. "[Master Luo] believed that besides skills, good
