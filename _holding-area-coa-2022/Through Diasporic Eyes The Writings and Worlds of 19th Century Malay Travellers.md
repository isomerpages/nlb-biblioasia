When we reached the bottom of the ship, I looked around me astonished, astonished, astonished, and no words will suffice, for I saw the magic [<i>hikmat</i>] of those steam machines [<i>pesawat asap</i>]. Six to seven fathoms of space were taken up by them alone! And I saw several people wiping, sweeping, oiling and polishing the iron and brasswork until they gleamed like mirrors. I saw nothing rusty, rough or dented, everything was smooth and shiny.1

                              — Munshi Abdullah, 1841                        


#### **Introduction**
When Munshi Abdullah (1796–1849) wrote the first Malay account of a steamship in 1841, he rendered a strange metal contraption of pipes, boilers and engines for his audience in terms and imagery they could understand. As the first Malay-authored work to be printed and commercially sold, <i>Cerita Kapal Asap</i> (The Tale of the Steamship) was part of a wider turning point in Malay history: from an era of sail and scribes, into the industrial
civilisation of steam and print.

This essay explores that transition as a mediated process, where a new Malay world was generated as much through reinvention from within as it was by external disruption, primarily European forces. It uses stories about travel to examine how Malays redefined the relationship between the local and foreign. As new technologies of transport and communication accelerated the integration of Southeast Asia into colonial empires, travel
became a means for Europeans to establish their authority over subjugated landscapes and peoples. Prolific studies have examined European travelogues, which began as adventurous accounts about the conquest of indigenous societies, and later reflected the rise in commercial tourism after the opening of the Suez Canal.2 The stock personalities, imagery and settings of Somerset Maugham and Isabella Bird, among many, portrayed
a distinctive colonial style that developed in British Malaya during the late 1800s. More importantly, their imaginative construction of space and place were arguments for European imperialism. As Lily Kong and Victor Savage noted, these works regularly featured the exotic peoples and lush tropics alternately feared and idealised, consistent with Edward Said and David Arnold’s influential theories considering the link between representation
and power.3

Yet the writing of travelogues by local authors expands the range of what journeying and travel writing meant at this time. Namely, that it was not the sole preserve of Europeans who mapped and surveyed static places and cultures. These travelogues affirm the circulation of Asians who thrived despite, but also because of, colonial networks. Beyond being tools of imperialism, the industrial technologies of steam and print were, as James Gelvin and Nile Green argued, “enabling technologies” that allowed Muslim societies to redefine their worlds both materially and conceptually.4 Malays harnessed both, as members of the growing Asian-Islamic community of information and movement. Following Mark Frost, this essay seeks to further illustrate how the expansion of print and maritime communication allowed Malay literati “to explore, to imagine and to define” a modernising Asia.5 With increasing encounters with the unfamiliar, Malays wrote their own accounts to interpret a new world on their own terms. Malay travelogues remain an underused source to describe the
colonial encounter in the 19th-century Malay world.

This essay does not seek to establish the travelogue as a coherent generic form in the Malay world or trace its trajectory of development. The term “travelogue” as used here refers to travel narratives – produced either as singular texts or as episodes within longer accounts – which this essay adopts as an analytical device. While travelogues did not exist as a distinct Malay literary genre, the narrative forms of<i> hikayat</i> (prose sagas) and syair (poetic ballads) were replete with extended accounts of characters wandering and undertaking quests. These episodes of movement and discovery were often central to the structure of the plot, as in the case of <i>Hikayat Awang Sulung Merah Muda</i> (Tale of Awang Sulung Merah Muda), which ends with the hero prince’s triumphant return to his rightful kingdom and romantic union with his beloved. This trope drew upon Javanese literature, especially the tales of Panji that became widely popular in Malay areas. <i>Hikayat Cekel Waneng Pati</i> (Tale of Cekel Waneng Pati), one such Panji-inspired Malay tale, involves a protagonist performing various trials and journeys to win the hand of his love. Another source of inspiration for Malay travel writing was the Perso-Arabic Islamic tradition, which, as will be explored later, found rich expression in early modern works such as <i>Hikayat Hang Tuah</i> (Tale of Hang Tuah).

These incipient travel narratives provided inspiration for 19th-century Malay writers, who infused them with Enlightenment ideas in newer<i>hikayat</i> and <i>syair</i>, but also the first dedicated travelogues. All were written by political elites, or those privileged enough by close association, to undertake and record their journeys. They were all also impacted by the changed landscape of their time: in nearby Java, the aristocrat Purwalelana’s travelogue (the first of its kind in Javanese) drew on the spiritual wanderings of earlier traditional tales while engaging with the colonial reality of the Cultivation System and the Great Post Road.6

In the 19th century, the Malay world’s maritime ecology of port
kingdoms was displaced by territorial colonial states. The scribe Ahmad Rijaluddin (1770–c. 1811) would have been a teenager when English official Francis Light acquired the island of Penang from the Sultan of Kedah in 1786. Thus began the creation of a British corridor in the Melaka Straits, with Melaka – a Malay emporium that passed over into Portuguese and later Dutch rule – and then Singapore coming under British control by 1824. For some, these “Straits Settlements” were oases: Munshi Abdullah
was glad to live under English laws that prevailed in his native Melaka and adoptive Singapore, where he worked for most of his adulthood and witnessed the arrival of Western medicines and machines. The Settlements later became beachheads for landward expansion into the peninsular Malay kingdoms, as increasing involvement in their internal crises culminated
in the “Forward Movement” of the late 19th century that created
“British Malaya”.

Yet the colonial advance was uneven and gradual, with the Malay
polities refashioning themselves and resisting in different ways, as the lives and accounts of the travelogue authors show. In Johor on the southern end of the Malay Peninsula, the Anglophile ruler Abu Bakar (1833–95) and his ministers built an administrative state drawing inspiration from not just Europe but also Meiji Japan and the Ottoman Empire. Munshi Abdullah’s son Ibrahim Munshi (1840–1904) and his student Salleh Bin Perang (1841–1915) were key figures in Abu Bakar’s government. South of Singapore, the
kingdom of Riau, which had been sundered from the Malay Peninsula by the 1824 Anglo-Dutch Treaty, brought itself closer to a burgeoning global Islamic network. While a protectorate of the Netherlands, it developed itself into a centre for Muslim learning where the court scholar Raja Ali Haji (1809–73) enjoyed frequent interaction with literati circulating between the Malay Archipelago and the Arab lands.

Set against these shifting power relations, the authors and their works expressed a range of identities and imaginaries that presented themselves for a remade Malay world. Munshi Abdullah’s two travelogues, one detailing his voyage from Singapore up the east coast of the Malay Peninsula, and a second across the Indian Ocean to Arabia, form part of his corpus as the
so-called father of modern Malay literature.7 But what their works more uniformly represent is the wider programme of modernist reform that Asian and Islamic societies initiated to meet the challenge of European expansion. As English-educated officials, Ibrahim and Salleh represented exposure to an intellectual culture foreign to the Malay world, based on printed books instead of manuscripts and oral accounts. Similar to the modernist reform projects undertaken by other non-European leaders, their works, like Abdullah’s, reproduced an Enlightenment-based notion of an
“advanced” society. This consisted of, among others, the sense of a growing gap between the past and the present, the notion of an “old” world in retreat before the “new”. This modernism was not easily mapped onto trajectories of secularisation; as Raja Ali Haji demonstrated, it also entailed the imposition of stricter textualist interpretations of Islam as an antidote to the decline resulting from folk Islam’s supposed laxity.

Far from being mere spectators and students of Eurocentric modernity, these Malay authors were experiencing and developing their own forms of worldliness and connectedness. How they described their encounters with, and tried to understand, unfamiliar places, people and objects, were rooted in earlier Malayo-Islamic conventions of travel narrative. Ahmad’s
1810 <i>Hikayat Perintah Negeri Benggala</i> (Tale of the Government of Bengal) and Raja Ali Haji’s <i>Tuhfat Al-Nafis</i> (The Precious Gift), completed in 1866, both documented the rise of colonial cities using the language of traditional romance and conventions of the rihla, a genre of travel writing in Islamic
literature. Ibrahim’s <i>Kisah Pelayaran</i> (Story of a Voyage), written in 1871–72, painted the old Malay world in twilight: mines and plantations opening it further to global capitalism, and displacing an entrepot-based economic pattern dominated by locally assimilated communities. His capacity to move between these worlds contrasts against his father’s caustic rancour towards the old Malay order. Salleh Bin Perang’s <i>Tarikh Dato Bentara Luar</i> (History of the Dato Bentara Luar) chronicled his 1883 journey with Abu Bakar to Japan. While crossing the South China Sea, Salleh conceived the ocean space as a site of observation in line with Victorian empiricism, but retained
Islamic cosmologies presenting natural phenomena as manifestations of divine will.

These continuities upset the canonical periodisation of Malay
intellectual history into the deceptively neat categories of “traditional”, “transitional” and “modern”. Instead of finding departure points or  clear delineations, this essay explores how the Malay world’s endogenous knowledge systems interacted with imperial modalities to create an embedded modernity. That the authors drew on a confluence of traditions to talk about their place in this new interconnected world reflects what Tim Harper termed “many traditions of thinking and acting globally” that
coexisted in the 19th century.8 Their journeys, both within and beyond the Malay world, defied the parameters that Europeans attempted to set, not just in surveys, maps and museums, but in travel writing as well: the idea of Malaya as a fixed territory, a destination to be visited rather than a dynamic node making autonomous links to the outside world.9

This essay by no means catalogues all 19th-century Malay travel writing. Among the unexplored works are major poetic travelogues: <i>Syair Peri Tuan Raffles Pergi Ke Minangkabau</i> (Ballad of Sir Raffles Going to Minangkabau;
1818), recounting Stamford Raffles’s expedition to the Minangkabau
Highlands; <i>Syair Kisah Engku Puteri</i> (Ballad of the Story of Engku Puteri;
1831), concerning the voyages of the Riau queen-consort Engku Puteri
Raja Hamidah; and <i>Syair Perjalanan Sultan Lingga Dan Yang Dipertuan
Riau Pergi Ke Singapura</i> (Ballad of the Journey of the Sultan of Lingga and
Viceroy of Riau to Singapore; 1891), which records a visit by the last Sultan
of Riau-Lingga to Singapore by Khalid Hitam Bin Raja Hasan al-Haji. All
these <i>syair</i>, written at different junctures of the 19th century, were of the
so-called “traditional” style, which again complicates a neat narrative of
literary “modernisation”.
