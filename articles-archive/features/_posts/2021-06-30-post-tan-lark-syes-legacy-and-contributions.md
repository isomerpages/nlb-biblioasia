#### **Lee Meiyu** looks back at the life of rubber tycoon Tan Lark Sye, long-time chairman of Hokkien Huay Kuan and the founder of the former Nanyang University in Singapore.

In October 2019, a ceremony was held at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) to mark the renaming of a road. Originally called Nanyang Valley, the small road leading to the Chinese Heritage Centre was renamed Tan Lark Sye Walk at an event attended by then Minister for Education Ong Ye Kung. [^1]

The new road name commemorates the efforts of a man who was the driving force behind the setting up of Nanyang University, a predecessor institution of NTU. Nantah, as it was known, was set up as a result of the rubber tycoon’s vision, determination and personal interest. He mooted the idea for the university in the early 1950s, pledged to personally donate $5 million to it, and was the first chairman of the university’s executive committee, a role he held for almost a decade.

The setting up of Nantah was a major point of pride for the Chinese community in Malaya. Thanks to Tan’s tireless efforts on behalf of the university, his name became indelibly linked with the institution. Unfortunately, Tan’s advocacy on behalf of Nantah was one of the reasons that led him into conflict with the government, culminating in his Singapore citizenship being revoked in 1964 following an inquiry into his political activities.

Although Tan ceased to be a citizen, he chose to continue living here. He focused on his businesses until his death from a heart attack about a decade later. Nantah soldiered on until 1980, when it merged with the University of Singapore to form the National University of Singapore. The next year, Nanyang Technological Institute (NTI) was set up on the premises of Nantah, and in 1991, it was renamed NTU.[^2]

##### Building a Business Empire
Malay weddings incorporate both Islamic practices as well as customs that are specific to Malay culture.[^3] In Singapore today, the core ceremonies are the *nikah* (the solemnisation), *walimah* (the communal wedding feast), *bersanding* (sitting-in-state during the walimah) and bertandang (the ceremony to welcome the bride/in-laws). All of these have changed over the last 50 or 60 years, both in ways large and small.
