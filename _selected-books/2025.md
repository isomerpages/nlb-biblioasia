#### **Bali 1952: Through the Lens of Liu Kang**

In 1953, four China-born artists who had made their home in Singapore held an exhibition titled&nbsp;_Bali_. It was a sensation. The works were inspired by their sketching trip to Java and Bali in June and July the previous year. While the exhibition is recognised as a major milestone in Singapore’s art history, few details of the trip have ever been revealed. Thanks to the discovery of over 1,000 photographs taken by Liu Kang during the seven-week adventure, the chronicle of their travels can now be told. With over 250 black-and-white photographs, fleshed out by Liu Kang’s private diary, letters to his wife and other archival sources, this book tells the story of an inspiring journey that left a lasting legacy on Singapore’s art history. With an artist’s eye, Liu Kang focused his lens on landscapes, architecture and scenes of daily life that preserve a moment in time, and captured the dignity of individuals in portraits. The painterly photographs are a time capsule of Indonesian history.
