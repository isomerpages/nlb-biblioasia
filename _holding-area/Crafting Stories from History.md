#### **From research to reimagination, the library and archives are shaping Felix Cheong’s creative processes.**

Author and poet Felix Cheong combines historical events with creative storytelling to create works that blur the lines between fact and fiction. As a writer, Cheong recognises the value of historical records to writers and poets in their creative process. “Historical records can take your writing – and your reader – into alleys and cul-de-sacs you might not have thought of,” he said.

This was the case with Cheong’s upcoming graphic novel, _A Mild Case of Mass Hysteria_, which is set to be published in 2026 by Penguin Random House SEA. The novel revolves around the Koro epidemic in Singapore in 1967. Koro is a psychiatric disorder where individuals believe their penises are retracting into their abdomen, causing intense panic.[^1]

In the graphic novel, one of the narratives involves a secret society member named Soo Tang. Cheong had originally intended for the character to fall in love with a member of the Red Butterfly gang – a notorious all-female gang, better known as Ang Hor Tiap, that had been active in the 1960s and 1970s.[^2]
