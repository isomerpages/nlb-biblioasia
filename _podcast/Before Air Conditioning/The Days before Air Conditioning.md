third_nav_title: Before Air Conditioning
---
<p>Before air-conditioning was introduced in Singapore in the 1920s, temperature
control was a matter of architectural design. Environmental historian Fiona
Williamson tells us how people kept themselves cool before air-conditioning
arrived, why weather science was important to the colonial enterprise,
and what environmental history can tell us about a city’s development.
