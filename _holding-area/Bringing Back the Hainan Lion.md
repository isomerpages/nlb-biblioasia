#### **The unexpected find of a cape with tiger markings in the storeroom of the Guang Wu Club led a martial artist and lion dance master to revive a lost art form in Singapore.**

When martial artist and lion dance master Raymond Foo, the head of 光武国术团 (Guang Wu Guoshu Tuan or Guang Wu Club), was about 15 years old, he chanced upon a cape with tiger markings in the club’s storeroom. He had come across the Hainan lion in photos and trained in martial arts and lion dance since he was 12, but no one could tell him what this striped cape was.&nbsp; His quest for answers brought him to Hainan Island and set him on a path to reviving and preserving an art form lost to Singapore.

An advocate of all things Hainanese, Foo has more than 50 years’ experience in martial arts and lion dance. Established in 1936, Guang Wu Club is the only organisation in Singapore that promotes the elusive Hainan lion dance (海南狮; Hainan _shi_), also known as 琼州狮 _(_Qiongzhou _shi)_, the Hainan tiger dance (海南虎; Hainan _hu_) and Hainan _qiong pai_ martial arts (琼派功夫; _qiong pai gong fu_). Even though the Hainan tiger dance is rarely performed in Singapore today, its influence on Hainan lion dance can still be seen.

#### **The Hainan Tiger**

In 2016, Foo went to Hainan Island to find out more about the origins of the mysterious tiger cape. He started his journey in Luowu Village in Sanjiang Town, Melian District, Haikou Hainan (海口市美兰区三江镇罗梧村; Haikoushi meilan qu sanjiang zhen luo wu cun), said to be the home of the Hainan tiger dance, which has a history of more than 300 years.

When Foo saw the full Hainan tiger at Luowu Village, he was astonished that it bore many similarities to the Hainan lion head in Gwang Wu’s possession in Singapore. The Hainan tiger had been brought to Singapore in the 1960s but it did not appeal to the masses, and thus rarely performed. At the time, the people were much more familiar with the Southern or Foshan (佛山), lion dance from Guangdong, especially during the Lunar New Year, and preferred a lion over a tiger to perform the “plucking of greens” (採青; _cai qing_) ritual to usher in good fortune and tidings.
