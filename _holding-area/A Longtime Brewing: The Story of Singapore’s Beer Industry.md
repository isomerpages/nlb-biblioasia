#### From Tiger to craft beer, beer brewing in Singapore has a long and storied history.
By Ho Sie Sie

Given Singapore’s warm climate, it will not come as a surprise that people are partial to the occasional glass of ice-cold beer. Or perhaps, more than an occasional glass. Beer production in Singapore is set to reach 200,000 metric tonnes by 2026. In 2021, Singapore was ranked 83rd among key markets across the world for beer production.[^1]

Local giant Tiger Beer dominates the scene, and indeed has been doing so for decades. However, the history of beer making in Singapore isn’t limited to Tiger Beer. Another beer with a long history in Singapore is Anchor Beer. Both Tiger and Anchor beers are made by Asia Pacific Breweries (APB), who also produce another well-known local brand, ABC Stout.
