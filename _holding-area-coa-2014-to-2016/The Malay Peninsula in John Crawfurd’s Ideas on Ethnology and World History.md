#### **Introduction**
Studying colonial writings, let alone understanding them, is a complex
undertaking. Ideas were relative to the author and could change over
time with global historical and intellectual developments. An author’s
perception could also change with age, experience and exposure to new
knowledge material. These features can be observed in the vast writings of
Dr John Crawfurd (1783–1868), Singapore’s second Resident, who served
with distinction from 1823 to 1826. Yet there is a tendency for scholars to
generalise their findings after reading selections or passages of an author’s
works. Examining only a fragment of an author’s writings will often yield
the expected results – a partial picture of the author’s ideas.

Mary Quilty’s *Textual Empires: A Reading of Early British Histories of
Southeast Asia* provides excellent coverage of the writings of key early
19th-century colonial writers on the Malay Peninsula, such as John Leyden
(1775–1811), Thomas Stamford Raffles (1781–1826), William Marsden
(1754 –1836), John Anderson (1795–1845) as well as Crawfurd. She goes
to great lengths to underscore the characteristics of their works and the intellectual influences that shaped their ideas and how their works
influenced the findings of others.1

Quilty’s analysis of Crawfurd’s writings, however, is limited to just three
of his publications. Her conclusion might have been different had she read
his other works. In total, Crawfurd wrote more than 70 books, periodicals
and articles in the course of his life. Nonetheless, given that her research
was published in 1998, Quilty might not have had the opportunity to access
Crawfurd’s other writings, as she would have today thanks to digitisation.
In spite of this, Gareth Knapman’s recent research on Crawfurd has shown
that Crawfurd’s opinions are still misunderstood – Crawfurd’s writings were
selected out of context and used to simplify 19th-century thought to the
point of misrepresentation.2

This paper seeks to explore Crawfurd’s diverse intellectual works to
determine how the inhabitants of the Malay Peninsula fit into his ideas on
ethnology and global views on history, and how he sought to apply these
concepts to chart the region’s history. Discussions regarding the traditional
homeland of the Malay Peninsula’s inhabitants, especially the Malays, are
a regular feature of his writings, and he would tie his hypothesis regarding
their origins to his ethnological view on the multiple origins of mankind. As
would become clear in his later ethnological articles, he explains the history
of the Malay Peninsula’s civilisational development in terms of his biological,
geographical and cultural understanding of the progress of mankind.

This paper will also examine how his ideas about the region were developed.
This offers us a glimpse of how British colonial discourse functioned, at least
during the 19th century. Some of Crawfurd’s knowledge was drawn directly
from his experiences and observations in the region, while others were
obtained from secondary readings and correspondence with his network
of scholars and sources in Europe and Asia. Although the Malay Peninsula during Crawfurd’s time was already home to multiracial communities, only
his views on what he considered the natives of the region – the Malays and
Aslian communities – will be covered in this study for reasons of scope.
His ideas about the mixed-race communities of the Straits, however, will be
touched on because of their connection with the local populace.

Among the 19th-century British scholar-administrators of the Malay
Peninsula, Crawfurd was one of the most accomplished in the intellectual
sphere. He was widely recognised by the scholarly community of his time
for his formidable intellect and his works on Asia (especially Southeast Asia),
as well as his contributions to the fields of ethnology and linguistics.3 *The
Spectator* noted in 1834 that “Crawfurd [was] well-known by his writings on
Eastern manners and statistics, and his exertions to open the British trade
with China and India”.4 Sir Frank Swettenham (1850–1946), former governor
of the Straits Settlements and commissioner for the Federated Malay States,
found that of Raffles, Marsden and Crawfurd, the latter wrote about the
Malay language with “probably the highest authority”.5

Crawfurd’s writings on Southeast Asia provided a wealth of information for
those with an interest in the region, especially merchants, intellectuals and
imperial civil servants (both aspiring and serving). They are still appreciated
for the insights they provide into Southeast Asia’s past, however flawed they
may be from today’s standpoint.6 In his intellectual pursuits, Crawfurd, like
many of his contemporaries, sought to understand the interplay between
mankind and its history. The inhabitants of the Malay Peninsula were often featured in his extensive writings on ethnology and (what would
now be termed as) world history. Crawfurd would, furthermore, use his
understanding of the Malay Peninsula’s inhabitants – racial features,
languages, their place in the civilisation scale of mankind and how they
got there, and communities that emerged out of interracial marriage – to
support his scientific position on human nature and their history, as well as
his views on polygenesis.

#### **A Sketch of Crawfurd’s Life and Career**
John Crawfurd was born on 13 August 1783, on the island of Islay in the
west of Scotland.7 His father, Samuel Crawfurd, was a medical doctor from
Ayrshire, known to be “a man of sense and prudence”, and his mother
was Margaret née Campbell.8 Crawfurd was educated in a village school
in Bowmore, Islay. In 1799, he enrolled in medical school in Edinburgh;
medicine was a field for which, “he never had much taste, having been
chosen for him”, according to his 1868 obituary in *The Sydney Morning
Herald*.9 It later became evident that Crawfurd’s interests lay in languages,
history, ethnology, natural sciences and political administration.

At the conclusion of his studies in 1803, he left for Calcutta, India, as an
assistant surgeon in the East India Company’s Bengal medical service,
being assigned to the army.10 In 1808, after five years of active service in the
northwestern provinces of India, Crawfurd was appointed to the medical
staff of Prince of Wales Island (present-day Penang), where he used his time to study the Malay language and its people.11 In 1811, together with Thomas
Stamford Raffles and John Leyden, Crawfurd was invited by Lord Minto
(1751–1814, also known as Gilbert Elliot, then Governor-General of India) to
accompany him on a military expedition against the Dutch in Java.12

This marked a major turning point in Crawfurd’s career; he would become,
as the anthropologist Ter Ellingson would best describe him, “a doctorturned-
colonial-diplomat”.13 He held various senior administrative posts
during the British occupation of Java (1811–16) because of his command
of the Malay language, eventually becoming Resident at the central court
of the Sultan of Yogyakarta.14 Crawfurd studied both ancient Kawi and
contemporary Javanese and befriended the Javanese aristocratic literati.15

Upon his return to Britain in 1817, he became a fellow of the Royal Society.
The advantage of Crawfurd’s position and local connections in the Malay
Peninsula and Java enabled him to acquire a number of local manuscripts.16
He would later compile the information he had gathered during his sojourn
in Southeast Asia and publish his widely-acclaimed three-volume *History of
the Indian Archipelago* in 1820.17 This seminal work, according to an article
a few decades later in the *Journal of the Indian Archipelago and Eastern Asia*,
placed “him in the first rank of ethnographers”.18
