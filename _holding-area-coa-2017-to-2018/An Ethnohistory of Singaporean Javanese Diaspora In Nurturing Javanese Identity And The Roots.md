### **Introduction**
On 29 May 2016, the Javanese Association of Singapore (JAS) conducted
the opening ceremony of the exhibition *Pusåkå* held at the Malay Heritage
Centre. Posing for group photos in front of a Malay-style building on a
typical day in Singapore were people dressed in full Javanese attire – women
in *kebaya* (traditional blouse-dress) with *batik* sarong, and men in *blangkon*
headdress complete with *kris* (a dagger with a wavy-edged blade). *Pusåkå*,
meaning heirloom or legacy in Javanese, showcased the heritage and
cultural history of the Javanese who settled in Singapore, as well as the ways
in which they nurtured their Javanese identity. *Pusåkå* featured a diverse
range of artefacts and everyday objects including a number of Javanese
family heirlooms passed down from one generation to the next. During
the exhibition’s opening speech, as reported by *The Straits Times*, Malay
Heritage Centre curator Suhaili Osman said that *Pusåkå* was an excellent
example of how we live and breathe heritage in our daily lives
sometimes without realising it (Kao, 2016).

Besides *Pusåkå*, seminar sessions were also organised, including a special
discussion on the roots journey conducted by Singaporean-Javanese Nori
Norindah Joyhana Ahmad, author of *The Roots of My Ancient Journey*. Nori’s
self-published book recounts a Singaporean-Javanese’s journey of self-discovery
and her experience on reconnecting with her Javanese ancestral
roots. After experiencing this journey, Nori began to nurture her Javanese
identity more seriously.

The roots journey is a massive phenomenon experienced by Singaporean-
Javanese living in the diasporic condition. These Singaporean-Javanese are
often interested in the romanticism of Javanese history and journeying to

Java, Indonesia in search of their roots. They trace their ancestry in Java
according to oral history or historical documents that have been and are
still handed down through generations. By going on a roots journey to Java,
they can cultivate more historical stories about Singapore from the Javanese
perspective. For many of them, this journey represents how they can
nurture their ancestral heritage and cultivate their identities as Javanese. This
phenomenon is intertwined with the history of the Javanese in Singapore
when Tumasik (Singapore’s ancient name) was one of the vassals of the
Javanese-Majapahit empire, as recorded in 14th century Javanese annals
*Nagarakrtagama* and *Pararaton* (Kriswanto, 2009:106; Riana, 2009:99). This
has also been supported by archeological evidence[^1] of jewellery typical of the
Javanese-Majapahit kingdom unearthed around Bukit Larangan (present-day
Fort Canning in Singapore) (Kwa, Heng and Tan, 2009:14; Miksic and Gek, 2004:17). This begets the question of how Singaporean-Javanese can
nurture Javanese cultural heritage in their daily lives in Singapore, and how
this would in turn encourage them to go on a roots journey to Java.

In the 2010 census of Singapore, 88,646 Singaporeans identified themselves
as “Javanese” (Singapore Department of Statistics, 2010:46). However, many
Singaporeans are still unaware of the history of the Javanese in Singapore.
The Javanese have been present in Singapore since the Majapahit empire,
when Singapore (then known as Tumasik) had been its vassal according
to the royal court poem of *Nagarakrtagama* written in 1365 (Anshory and
Arbaningsih, 2008:84; Purwadi, 2005:12; Poesponegoro and Notosusanto,
1992:92; Robson, 1995:35). Javanese mass migration continued after the
arrival of the British in the early 19th century. In short, there have been four
main phases of Javanese migration in Singapore: the Nusantara ancient era
of Tumasik, the British colonial era, the Japanese Occupation era and the
modern era of Singapore.

As such, it might be surprising to some that there is little literature
examining the Javanese in Singapore, and what exists are student theses,
such as: “The Javanese of Singapore” by Abdul Aziz bin Johari (University
of Malaya, 1961), “The Baweanese and the Javanese in Singapore: A
Comparative Analysis of Integration in a Plural Sociology by Juliana
Khusaini (National University of Singapore, 1989) and “A History of
the Javanese and Boyanese in Singapore” by Hwee Hwee Jeanette Chia
(National University of Singapore, 1992). Despite the existence of such
theses, there are no published books on the subject. Moreover, little has
been said about the contemporary movement in the form of the roots
journey undertaken by Singaporean-Javanese. This study thus seeks to
bridge the gap in Singapore’s knowledge about the Javanese in Singapore.

Ethnohistory combines the approaches of history, philology, cultural
anthropology and archaeology (Calloway, 1983:97; Carmack, 1972:230;
Chavez, 2008:487; Gadacz, 1982:148). Ethnohistory, in short, is based on
historical documents, but are written with anthropological insight (Harkon,
2010:113; Sluis and Edwards, 2013:72, Wood, 1990:81). By combining
historical and ethnographic approaches according to Fontana (1961:10), this
ethnohistorical study will examine historical data through empirical facts
in the field. The historical explanation in this paper can be positioned as an
integral part of understanding the dynamic picture of the development of
the Javanese in Singapore.

In the case of diasporas, the romantic memory of ancestors is the main pillar
of nurturing a distinctive identity and strengthening the diaspora’s sense of
belonging to their ancestral homeland. In the context of the Singaporean-
Javanese, the Javanese identity is built upon two main elements: the
history of the Javanese in Singapore and the way Javanese culture has been
assimilated into the Malay culture in Singapore. Nurturing the Javanese
identity in Singapore, which is “unique” compared to being Javanese in
Java, compels the Singaporean-Javanese go on a roots journey to Java,
motivated not only by the desire to trace their roots but also to reminisce
about Java’s history in Tumasik in the context of Singapore.

Crafted from something new and rereading existing historical sources,
this study attempts to present an alternative perspective of the Javanese in
Singapore and examine how the roots journey is nurtured by analysing two
aspects: identity and history. This paper is centred around these two aspects,
explaining history and identity as integral parts of understanding the roots
journey undertaken by the Singaporean-Javanese diaspora.

#### **Navigating Diaspora and the Notion of Homeland**

In many studies, diaspora is linked to the notion of homeland (see e.g. Basu,
2007; Clifford, 1994; Cohen, 2008; Falzon, 2003; Knoot and McLoughlin,
2010; Levy and Weingrod, 2005; Morawska, 2011; Rozen, 2008; Sheffer,
2010; Tololyan, 2007). Levy and Weingrod (2005:3) reveal that home in
this context is much more than a physical structure (a house), but also an
imagined place with a set of feelings and imaginative realms. Home is a
process of creating and understanding forms of living and belonging. This
means home can evoke a sense of belonging, a memory of the past and
variable emotions. As a result, links with the ancestral homeland are often
decorative and deeply embedded in memories of diasporic people (Clifford,
1994:304). Falzon (2003:664) states that homeland is generally understood as
a sacred place filled with forms of longing and memory, either about culture
or ancestors, and diasporic people dislocated from their homeland will
maintain their imagined-homeland “by making a new home” while living in
their host countries. According to Tölölyan (2007:649), the continuation of
home-maintaining can be performed by commemorating and reconstructing
a collective identity that preserves elements of the homeland’s language,
religion, social practice and cultural heritage.

In this study, the ethnographic data shows that the historical explanation
of the Javanese in Singapore since the 12th to 14th centuries (according to
archaeological remains found in Singapore) is part of the foundation of
nurturing Javanese identity and maintaining links with their homeland
by means of cultural preservation. Subjects we interviewed affirmed the
importance of this to them:

   united Nusantara by means of Palapa expedition) was here…”*<br><br>

Many Singaporean-Javanese share Sri’s (a third generation Singaporean-
Javanese) sentiment – the romanticism of the ancient history of the Javanese
in Tumasik is a part of respecting their ancestors and understanding the
lineage of Javanese migration to Singapore to the present day. From that
story, it can be inferred that the oral tradition is the foremost method in
transmitting stories of one’s roots in human culture. Supporting this idea
is existing literature that states that remembering ancestors is a basic part
of human culture (Fairley, 2003; Geana, 2005; Levitt, 2010; Schenider,
2008;, Schraam, 2010). Generally, tales about one’s ancestors are passed
down through the generations through storytelling, at least within families.
Among the Singaporean-Javanese, there are several stories that are recalled
and shared, such as the story of Javanese Singhasari-Majapahit kingdoms
in Tumasik, the story of ancestral migration during Islamic Hajj during
the colonial era, the story of being Javanese and Malay, and the story of
reconnecting with one’s roots.

According to Geana (2005:349), one of the most ancient and elaborate
cultural acts is the devotion of the ancestral cult by remembering and also
worshipping the deceased, the so-called memorialisation of ancestors that
answers a fundamental need of humans – the need to remember. This can
be done by recalling a story of origins that employs genealogies of human
history (Schraam, 2010:23). According to Schenider (2008:2), telling stories
is how people construct meaning from memory, but the process is selective and many factors influence which stories are told. Repeating stories of and
about ancestors, or so-called *Ngeling-eling* in the Javanese language, is one
of the pillars of Javanese culture. Repeating ancestral stories is also linked to
a search for selfhood for diasporic people. *Ngeling-ngeling* can be deduced
as a part of cultivating Javanese identity and maintaining Javanese heritage.
This can be done by several modes: retelling stories of one’s roots, as well as
cultivating and finding one’s roots.

This is in line with the wise Javanese saying: “Javanese people without
the knowledge of their past history is [sic] like a tree without roots, *koyo
kacang lali kulite* (such as a peanut forgetting its nutshell)”. This is what
Arora and Sanos (2011:91) call the melancholia of diaspora, where the
diasporic imagination is filled with stories of loss, past memories and
recalling history. In the case of Singaporean-Javanese diaspora, recalling
a story of ancestors can be done by referring to the archeological
evidence found at Bukit Larangan that shows the Javanese Singhasari-
Majapahit civilisation in Tumasik as well as modern migration during
the colonial era.

In fact, the archaeological evidence comprising Javanese-Majapahit
jewellery, unearthed during excavations in Bukit Larangan between
1926 and 1928, indicates that Javanese civilisations existed in Singapore
since the 14th century (Anne and Lim, 2017:4; Bastin, 1994:5 Kwa, Heng
and Tan, 2009:14; Miksic and Gek, 2004:17; Turnbull, 1989:19; Yeo,
2017:24). According to a verse in *Nagarakrtagama*[^2] written in Kawi, an
ancient Javanese language (Riana, 2009:99),[^3] Tumasik was a vassal of the
Javanese-Majapahit kingdom (Robson, 1995:2).

 <div style="background-color: white;">The verse in <i>Nagarakrtagama</i> mentions Tumasik (Singapore) as part of the Majapahit empire. <i>Image source: I Ketut Riana, Kakawin Desa Warnnana Uthawi Nagara Krtagama: Masa Keemasan Majapahit (Jakarta: Penerbit Buku Kompas, 2009), 99.</i></div>

In line with *Nagarakrtagama*, Singapore is also mentioned in the
majestic pledge[^4] of Gadjah Mada during his inauguration as Majapahit
Amangkubhumi (prime minister) in 1336 CE (Hazra, 2007:40). In addition,
in 1275 CE (prior to the Majapahit period), Kertanegara from the Singhasari
kingdom invaded Malayu under the Pamalayu expedition as narrated in
*Pararaton* and *Nagarakertagama* after Kertanegara’s great victory in attacking
Jambi and Palembang (Adji and Achmad, 2013:94; Barwise and White,
2012:69; Blagden, 1909:23; Hall, 1960:67; Munoz, 2006:262; Ricklefs,
2001:22; Rouffaer and Winstedt, 1922:56). The Pamalayu expedition in 1187
caka, or 1275 CE, is also mentioned in the texts *Pararaton*, *Kidung Panji
Wijayakrama*, *Kidung Harsawijaya* and *Nagarakrtagama pupuh 41* (Muljana,
2011:112-113).

 <div style="background-color: white;">The Majapahit territory as depicted in court poem <i>Nagarakrtagama</i>.  <i>Image source: Damar Shashangka, Sabda Palon III: Geger Majapahit (Jakarta: Penerbit Dolphin,2013),  4.</i></div>

Written historical records depicting the Javanese civilisation in Singapore
after the decline of Majapahit are scarce.[^5] Singapore was subsequently
governed under the reign of the Johore-Riau-Lingga Sultanate (Rahim,
2006:521).[^6] When Raffles arrived in Singapore, there were already
indigenous people, including Malays living in *kampongs* (villages) and
Orang Laut (sea gypsies comprising the Orang Kallang, Orang Seletar/
Slitar, Orang Selat and Orang Gelam), living around the mouth of the Singapore River, Kallang River, Telok Blangah and along the Johor Straits
(Diagana and Angresh, 2013:21).

The story of the Javanese in Tumasik can be considered as the pride of
Singaporean-Javanese in modern Singapore, representing the spirit of
exploration of the Javanese in modern Singapore. The story of the
Javanese during the Majapahit and Singhasari eras in Tumasik also
underscores the importance of commemorating *simbah* (literally
translated as ancestors in Javanese) as part of nurturing ancestral
roots and cultivating Javanese identity.

#### **Nurturing Javanese Identity in the Malay Community**
Most discussions of diaspora are firmly rooted in the concepts of
homeland and identity (see e.g. Arora and Sanos, 2011; Brienkerhoff, 2009;
Drzewiecka, 2002; Esman, 2009; Oonk, 2007; Peachey, 2011; Safran, 1999;
Zhao, 2008). One difficulty with the use of the word “identity” is that
different disciplines use the term to mean different things. According to
Peachey (2011:14), the term “identity” within diaspora studies is concerned
with the sense of a people’s conceptualisation of self; the ways in which
people subjectively perceive or experience themselves in host societies
through names, labels and identification. From Peachey, it can be inferred
that diasporic people need to actualise themselves with specific names, labels
and identification. Hence, Singaporean society may recognise the existence
of Singaporean-Javanese within the Malay community through their
adherence to the Javanese identity.

To support the argument, this section elucidates some of the existing
literature that describes the preservation of cultural heritage and identity.
Levitt (2010:42) reveals that diasporic people strongly reinforce homeland
ties by cultivating “the identity of origin”. Supporting Levitt, Allen
(2013:3) says that to cultivate the identity of origin, diasporic people
establish and reaffirm their ethnic identity in new places by reconstructing
an imagined homeland. Other arguments related to theoretical concepts
are that nurturing one’s historical ethnic background is important for
diasporic people to commemorate ancestral memories (Leong, 2014;
Marschall, 2013), to cultivate ancestral identity (Bhandari, 2013; Naho and
Stronza, 2010; Marschall, 2014), and to romanticise “a home identity”
(Bandyopadhyay, 2008; Man, 2014). Therefore, in this section it can be
argued that by maintaining Javanese cultural heritage within the Malay

community, Singaporean-Javanese also strengthen their identities
as Javanese.

At present, the Javanese in Singapore are often linked to the Malays.
In Singapore’s national context, Malay is used as a race category by the
government and as an ethnic group referring to the indigenous people of
Singapore (Ibrahim, 2014:2; Rahim, 2006:521). According to Suryakencana
Omar, head of the Javanese Association of Singapore (JAS), the earliest
historical data [as noted by Amin (2017:215–216)] of contemporary Javanese in Singapore dates back to the 1820s.[^7]

Asia, Commercial, Industrial and Scientific (Madras: Printed at the
Scottish &amp; Adelphi presses, 1873).</i></div>

The 1980 population census
states that the Malay include all persons of Malay or Indonesian origin
such as Malays, Javanese, Boyanese and Bugis, by means of a patrilineal
system (Amin, 2017:200).

To minimise social conflict among the early immigrants in Singapore,
Raffles, along with his government, formulated a town plan (also called
the Jackson Plan) in 1822 to divide residential land based on the different
races in Singapore (Anne and Lim, 2017:24). These ethnic-based areas were
assigned names such as Kampong Java and Kampong Bugis.[^8]

Over time,
close interactions and shared religious values among immigrant communities resulted in the Javanese being labelled as Malay. This made it difficult for the
Javanese identity to stand alone, as shared by Suryakencana Omar:

   *“Being Javanese among the Malay community in Singapore is not<br> 
   an easy task as we [have to] work much harder in nurturing our<br> 
   identity than the Javanese in Java, who have a ‘taken for granted<br> 
   identity’ from the ancestors.”<br><br> 
   Interview with Suryakencana Omar<br> 
   Malay Heritage Centre, Singapore<br>

Although many Singaporean-Javanese no longer speak Javanese in their
daily lives, they still preserve their heritage in their own way. Crang
(2010:139) argues how food can connect people to personal and social
memories of their homeland. The well-known dish *nasi ambeng*, for
example, is an integral part of the Selametan or Kenduri. Dishes that
Singaporeans might be familiar with but are unaware are Javanese include
*soto*, *satay*, *nasi rawon* and *tempe*. According to the Singaporean-Javanese
diaspora, their links to Javanese cuisine, albeit adapted to suit local tastes
with influences from Malay, Indian and Chinese cuisines, is one of their
most important, particularly when set within the Malay community.
Therefore, diverse Javanese foods are still consumed among Singaporean
society. Singaporean-Javanese Haider Surya noted that many Javanese
dishes such as nasi *ambeng*, *satay* and *tempe* have been commercialised and
distributed around Singapore. This reproduces the Javanese identity as
Singaporean-Javanese are able to easily access authentic Javanese food
in Singapore.

(see footnote 8).<i> Courtesy of Fuji Prastowo, 2018.</i></div>

Cuisine aside, there are many intangible Javanese cultural arts found in
Singapore such as dance, *pencak silat* (martial arts), gamelan (traditional
ensemble music originating from Java and Bali), *jamu*, *keris* and *kuda
kepang*. To preserve Javanese heritage in Singapore, several organisations
have been established, such as Kesenian Tedja Timur/Kuda Kepang
(established in 1991), Sri Warisan (*wayang kulit* Singapore/Javanese
puppet show founded in 1997), Perguruan Silat Kembang Wali (*pencak
silat* group), Perguruan Seni Beladiri Tapak Suci Singapura (*pencak silat*
group), Pacitan Gamelan (founded in 1991 at the Kembangan Community
Club), Singa Nglaras at the Department of Southeast Asian Studies in

the National University Singapore (established in 2004) and Gamelan
Asmaradana Ltd (founded in 2004). The first organisation for the Javanese
in Singapore was Persekutuan Jawa Al-Masakin (loosely translated as the
Federation of the Javanese Poor), which was formed in 1901 to provide
material and moral support to Javanese who had moved to Singapore.

In late 2007, with the popularity of social media platform Facebook, three
Facebook groups – “Javanese Singaporeans”, “Singaporean Javanese” and
“Orang Jawa in Singapore” (Javanese in Singapore) – were set up. The
following year, the groups merged to become “Javanese Singaporeans (JS):
Orang Jawa di Singapura”. It should be noted that the Javanese Association
of Singapore (JAS), which was formed by members of informal groups such
as Perkumpulan Anak Jawa Pacitan, Kesenian Tedja Timur and the Javanese
Singaporeans Facebook groups, had evolved from online entities into a
legally registered “society” organisation on 10 September 2015. An example
of concrete action in preserving Javanese culture is the hosting of the May
2016 exhibition “Pusaka: Heritage and Culture of the Javanese in Singapore”
(Chew, 2016; Kao, 2016). This validates the claim that the Singaporean-
Javanese continue to nurture their identity today.

Javanese identity is articulated not only at the individual level, but also
collectively framed into *perkumpulan* (organisations). Referring to Duarte 


<img src="/images/COA%202017%20to%202018/Ethnohistory%20of%20Singaporean/Javanese_Singaporeans.jpg" style="width:100%;">

(2005:316), diaspora is similar to collectivism, in which collective identity
can be reconstructed by several processes and practices shared by members
of a diaspora in a host country. This is to say that solidarity is the main way
to build a strong social community (Christenen and Levinson, 2003:134).
In addition, Drzewiecka (2002:2) suggests that diasporic people struggle to
reconstitute collective identities by reproducing their familiar environment
among them. In a collective society, they can enjoy the fellowship and
relationships with members who share the same culture, sustain the same
tradition, eat the same food and speak the same language. Generally,
the Javanese have a strong culture of communalism. Huggan (2010:56)
argues that diaspora identities are those that are constantly producing and
reproducing themselves through transformation and difference. Hence, the
existence of community can be considered as the power of representing and
strengthening group identity for Singaporean-Javanese so as to differentiate
themselves from other Malay groups.

This is to say that the theoretical framework of heritage comprises not
only sites, places, performances or events, but also social construction
and cultural practice, hence drawing attention to the process of heritagemaintenance.
This supports the construction of home as the remembrance
of the past, present and future. “Home is where the heart is” is a phrase
uttered by many who have experienced migration and displacement.
In this context, the Singaporean-Javanese construct the “home of
Java” but in a unique way that is influenced by Malay culture. Thus,
“in-betweenness” is the way Singaporean-Javanese embrace the identities
of being simultaneously Javanese and Malay. This sentiment is reflected by
Zuraidah Ehsan:

   *“In-betweenness is not a bad thing for us [Singaporean-Javanese],<br>
   it has become the uniqueness of the Singaporean-Javanese diaspora<br>
   in being able to adapt to a place where we are living now, in the<br>
   Malay area. Being Malay does not mean we forget our roots<br>
   as Javanese.”<br><br>

So, who are the Malays?[^9] The Malays are the indigenous people of
Singapore, comprising 13.4 percent of Singaporean society, making them
a minority (Rahman, 2017:1). As the *Report of the Select Committee on
Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Bill* of 1998 declared inter alia: “A
person belonging to the Malay Community means any person, whether
of the Malay race or otherwise, who considers himself/herself to be a
member of the Malay community and who is generally accepted as a
member of the Malay community by that community.” (Tham, 1992:11)
Because of the importance of the 1998 Bill, the political view of Malays in
Singapore implies that the definition of being Malay is not only based on
biological inheritance but also from a self-defined or sense of belonging in
being Malay.

The role of Islam also provides a meeting point for Javanese and Malay
identities since universal values in Islam are a powerful factor that facilitates
assimilation in terms of religious rituals, trade, education and marriage.
In this case, Malay values have been exchanged and strengthened by the
education system where generations of Javanese or other tribes from the Nusantara archipelago have sent their children to Malay schools. Therefore,
the Malay identity would have been formally practiced in education, the
religious environment, as well as interracial marriage. However, the Javanese
identity remains sustainable in the smallest environment – the family.
Javanese identity can be strengthened through the family by inculcating
children with Javanese manners, teaching members about Javanese cuisine
and speaking Javanese. Some families in Singapore deliberately send the
younger generation to Java to immerse them in Javanese culture. Given this
definitional fluidity, it follows then that a Javanese who assumes a Malay
identity has not lost their ethnic identity but has come to see themselves as
simultaneously Javanese and Malay.

On another level of analysis, the preservation of Javanese ancestral heritage
for the purpose of nurturing the Javanese identity conducted by the
Singaporean-Javanese has a strong correlation to the reasons that encourage
them to travel to Java. Travelling to Java can be considered a significant
effort to preserve Javanese cultural heritage by networking with local people
in one’s ancestral homeland, sharing stories with Java-born Javanese,
exchanging views with Javanese cultural experts, studying the development
of Javanese culture in Java for application in Singapore, cultivating Javanese
identity, and much more. Therefore, it can be said that the roots journey
and preservation of Javanese culture are interrelated.

#### **Emerging Trends of the Roots Journey**
In line with earlier arguments, it can be argued that the preservation of
the memory of ancestors by reconstructing the “home” and maintaining
Javanese cultural heritage as a form of representing their identity encourages
Singaporean-Javanese to go to Java on a roots journey. The internet,
especially Facebook, is essential in facilitating global interaction among
Javanese diaspora, which can strengthen the Javanese identity among
Singaporeans. Like other Javanese diaspora, the Singaporean-Javanese try to
strengthen their Javanese identity by contacting Javanese in Java via social
media platforms to find out the latest issues concerning their culture. This
leads them to undertake the roots journey by tracing the history of their
ancestors. This is why discussing the contemporary Singaporean-Javanese
identity cannot be separated from the roots journey phenomenon. Their
experiences either on Facebook or in Java produce global relationships with
other Javanese diasporas elsewhere. It reveals the cycle of migration that
results in the return to ancestral lands and a new facet in their identity.

   East Java where my father came from. My father travelled alone<br>
   from Java to Singapore around the 1920s when he was 17 years old<br>
   and ended up here for the rest of his time because someone stole<br>
   his luggage, including his money and passport. Unfortunately, as<br>
   Orang Atas (a notable and educated Javanese person), he never<br>
   clearly revealed who he was until he died. This mystery strongly<br>
   motivates me to go on a roots journey again and again.”<br><br>
   – Interview with Sujono<br>
   Jurong, Singapore<br>
   25 February 2018*

As a Singaporean-Javanese, Sujono considers himself like a sturdy tree whose
branches and flowers blossom in Singapore, but whose roots are still firmly
planted in his ancestral island of Java. This is the most popular metaphor
among the diaspora. Sujono experienced the roots journey in Java by
following an ancestral path from the village where his grandfather had been
born in Tuban, to the harbour where his ancestors had left Java forever.

There is a myriad of literature on the phenomenon of members of diasporas
travelling to their homelands for nostalgic tourism (Mitchell, 1998),
homeland tourism or homeland journeys (Bandyopadhyay, 2008; Iorio
&amp; Corsale, 2013), ancestral tourism (Bhandari, 2013; Man, 2014; Leong,
et.al, 2014; Russell, 2008), homesick tourism (Marschall, 2014) and roots
tourism (Basu, 2005; Pinho, 2008; Naho and Stronza, 2010). The roots
journey seeks some form of remedy of memories to commemorate ancestral
histories (Leong &amp; et.al, 2014; Prastowo, 2017), to trace their ancestral
sites in the homeland (Dubuisson &amp; Genina, 2011; Kuutma, 2013), and
to remember ancestral routes in the process of becoming diasporic people
(Iorio and Corsale, 2013; Marschall, 2013; Pinho, 2008). The roots journey
is an example of how Singaporean-Javanese nurture their ancestral roots by
travelling to their homeland in Java.

The importance of finding one’s roots strongly underscores how essential
ancestral roots are to the Singaporean-Javanese, because remembering roots
is one of the pillars of Javanese culture. Generally, Singaporean-Javanese
trace their ancestry in Java according to oral stories or historical documents
that were handed down through the generations. Like Sujono, most of
them follow the path from the village in Java where their ancestor was born to where (usually the harbour) they had left Java. When in Java, the
atmosphere of rural life and engaging in small talk with the locals, reaffirms
and rejuvenates the Singaporean-Javanese’s identity as Javanese. The results
of travelling to Java vary depending on how travellers feel post-travel.

Social media provides a platform for diverse virtual interactions between
the Javanese diaspora and Javanese in Java. Often, Javanese diaspora
meet on Facebook and share the experiences of their roots journey – for
instance, on Facebook group Ngumpulke Balung Pisah (loosely translated
as gluing separated bones together).[^10] These virtual interactions eventually
led the Javanese diaspora from around the globe, including Singaporean-
Javanese, to organise the first conference of the Javanese Diaspora in
Yogyakarta, called Ngumpulke Balung Pisah (Kurniawan, 2015), on 15 and
16 August 2015.

The Singaporean-Javanese have played an important role not only as
participants but also as founders of the worldwide organisation, whose
long-term vision is to preserve Javanese cultural heritage around the globe.
At present, reflecting on the international interactions among the Javanese
diaspora across the globe, either in the virtual or physical realms, can
encourage the Singaporean-Javanese to strengthen their distinctive identity
as Javanese in Singapore rather than Malay, as Malay is an unfamiliar
concept for Javanese diaspora living outside of the Nusantara archipelago
(such as in Suriname, New Caledonia, the Netherlands and parts of the
Caribbean). It supports reflections on “what should be Javanese” by means
of mutual dialogue.

As Java is a short trip from Singapore, supported by many affordable
flights to Jakarta, Yogyakarta and Surabaya, the roots journey has become
essential for all Singaporean-Javanese. This journey is an integral part of
strengthening Javanese identity among the Singaporean-Javanese today.

#### **Conclusion**

Coming back to the question that is the essence of this paper – how do
Singaporean-Javanese nurture their identities by preserving Javanese cultural
heritage in their daily lives in Singapore, and how does this encourage
them to undertake the roots journey to Java? There are, of course, no easy
explanations. This question elicits diverse responses depending on the
definition of social identity, because identity is never static and always
responds to socio-political developments of the present-day. Identity is a
complex, even slippery, concept, shaped by history, culture and imagination
(Pang and Meyer, 2016:2). Social identity, indeed, focuses on shared social
characteristics (Mutalib 2012:12; Ratnasingam, 2010:4). To conclude, social
identity nurtured by the Singaporean-Javanese emphasises shared aspects
of identity, of being Malay without forgetting one’s Javanese roots. As
having a dual identity is common in all societies, a Singaporean can be
Malay and yet Javanese at the same time. There was once a clear distinction
between Malay and other Nusantara ethnic groups. However, over time,
through intermarriage, social interaction, education and policy, a new social
identity was built as a Malay community shaped by religion, customs and
language. In an individual context, the self-identification of being Javanese is
important to the reinforcement of the homeland of Java in Singapore.

Present-day Singaporean-Javanese are by and large shaped by their past,
which is supported by many archeological corroborations relating to
Javanese civilisation in Singapore around Bukit Larangan and the Singapore
River. But one thing is very clear: revisiting history is necessary to bridge the
question of being Singaporean-Javanese. Since mobility can be considered
a central part of Javanese DNA, this study thus concludes that the history
of Javanese migration to Singapore can be summarised into four periods:
First, during the Nusantara era (whether under Singhasari, Majapahit or
even long before that such as Srivijaya and ancient Mataram); Second,
during the British colonial period; Third, during the Japanese Occupation
or Syonan-to period; and fourth, during the present-day modern state of
Singapore – by which time (as recorded by the Indonesian National Agency
of the Placement and Protection of Migrant Workers, or BNP2TKI), 13,379
Indonesians were employed as migrant workers in Singapore (as of 2018),
most of whom were Javanese. This shows that the migration of the Javanese
to Singapore has spanned hundreds or maybe even thousands of years.

In a nutshell, the preservation of “home” implies identity and leads diaspora
to undertake the roots journey or “homecoming”. The reconstruction
of a Java home among Singaporean-Javanese people may refer to the
relationships or connections over space and time to their imagined
homeland in Java, harmonised within the context of Singapore. Through
the preservation of Javanese cultural heritage in Singapore, the Singaporean-
Javanese can continue to pass down the stories of their ancestors to the
present-day to nurture Javanese identity. This is viewed in terms of how
Singaporean-Javanese people define and represent themselves as Javanese,
because by having a strong emotional attachment to their homeland and
constructing their identities as Javanese, they are probably more motivated
to preserve their ancestral cultural heritage in Singapore, especially in
Malay society. In short, the existence of Singaporean-Javanese with all their
uniqueness in syncretizing Javanese and Malay cultures strengthens the
colour of multiculturalism in Singapore.

To a large degree, and for future research, this study should be continued
by those who are interested in working with the history of the Javanese in
Singapore, as this paper only scratches the surface of the missing link in the
narrative of Singapore’s national history.

[^1]: Jewellery typical of the Majapahit empire were unearthed by archaeologists in the late 20th century in Bukit Larangan (present-day of Fort Canning in Singapore). This points to the presence of the Javanese in Singapore since the 14th century. During the excavations from 1926 to 1928 near the Keramat Iskandar Shah in Bukit Larangan, workers unearthed gold ornaments such as a pair of earrings and an armlet that was engraved with the Majapahit demoniac Kala face, an epithet of Siva (Kwa Chong Guan, Heng Derek Thiam Soon and Tan Tai Yong, [_Singapore, a 700-Year History: From Early Emporium to World City_](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/redir/itemdetails?bid=13205984)) (Singapore: National Archives of Singapore, 2009), 14 (From National Library Singapore, call no.

Some experts believe these artefacts show that Javanese royalty had lived in this area (Lesley-Ann Tan and Monica Lim, [_Secrets of Singapore: National Museum_](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/redir/itemdetails?bid=202769140) (Singapore: Epigram Books, 2017), 4. (From National Library Singapore, call no. RSING 959.57 TAN)). The bathing princesses and the ruins wall, nearly 5m wide and 3m high, was discovered in 1822 by John Crawfurd. This wall was included in Chinese merchant Wang Da Yuan’s chronicle in 1349. Wang noted that prior to his visit to Singapore in 1330, the Siamese had invaded the city. The locals had withstood the attack from behind a wall, much like a fortress. The 14th century saw the Javanese-Majapahit and Siamese Ayutthaya kingdoms interminably battling for hegemony in the region called Tumasik (Melissa Diagana and Jyoti Angresh, [_Fort Canning Hill: Exploring Singapore’s Heritage and Nature_](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/redir/itemdetails?bid=14716750) (Singapore: ORO editions, 2013) 33.

[^2]: _Nagarakrtagama_, also known as _Desawarnana_, is an old Javanese eulogy to the Majapahit King Rajasanagara (known informally as Hayam Wuruk) written by the Superintendent of Buddhist Affairs (Dharmadhyaksa Kasogatan), whose pen-name was Mpu Prapanca, in 1365 during the reign of Hayam Wuruk (1330-1367). Hayam Wuruk had wanted to conquer all of Nusantara under the Majapahit kingdom (Hadi Sidomulyo and Nigel Bullough, _Napak Tilas Perjalanan_ \[Napak Tilas Travel\] (Jakarta: Wedatama, 2007, 3)

[^3]: The verse of _Nagarakrtagama_ in Kawi that identifies Tumasik as part of the Javanese-Majapahit kingdom (I Ketut Riana, _Kakawin Desa Warnnana Uthawi Nagara Krtagama: Masa Keemasan Majapahit_ (Jakarta: Penerbit Buku Kompas, 2009, 99), can be translated as follows: “In the territory of Pahang, the main places are Hujung and Medini, Lengkasuka and Sai as well as Kelanten and Tringgano, Nasor, Paka, Muwar, Dungun, Tumasik as Sang Hyang Hujung, Kelang, Keda, Jere, Kanjap, and Niran, the whole region as a group”.

[^4]: This oath pledge was written in _Pararaton_, the book of Kings of Singhasari and Majapahit, in the late 15th century, as follows:<br> “Sira Gajah Madapatih Amangkubhumi tan ayun amuktia palapa, sira Gajah Mada:<br>“Lamun huwus kalah nusantara isun amukti palapa, lamun kalah ring Gurun, ring Seran,<br>Tañjung Pura, ring Haru, ring Pahang, Dompo, ring Bali, Sunda, Palembang, Tumasik,<br>samana isun amukti palapa.” <br>(He, Gajah Mada Patih Amangkubumi, does not wish to cease his fasting. Gajah Mada:<br>“If \[I succeed\] in defeating (conquering) Nusantara, \[then\] I will break my fast. If Gurun,<br>Seram, Tanjung Pura, Haru, Pahang, Dompo, Bali, Sunda, Palembang, Temasek/Tumasik,<br>are all defeated, \[then\] I will break my fast.”).

[^5]: In Java, Demak was declared as the first Islamic Sultanate after Daha, the capital city of Majapahit under the kingship of Girindrawardhana, was conquered in 1517 (Marwati Djoened Poesponegoro and Nugroho Notosusanto, _Sejarah Nasional Indonesia, Jilid II_ (Yogyakarta: Balai Pustaka, 1992, 325); Purwadi, _Babad Majapahit_, 45). In 1511 and 1521, a Javanese expedition to Singapore took place under Pati Unus, the second Sultan of Demak, who accepted the Sultan of Malacca’s request to seize Malacca from Portuguese control. This event was recorded in _Suma Oriental_ by Tome Pires as the expedition of “Pate Onus”. However, the attempt to seize Malacca failed and Pati Unus was later known as Pangeran Sabrang Lor, literally translated as the “prince who crossed the sea to the north, the Malay Peninsula” (Anshory, H. M. Nasruddin and Arbaningsih, _Negara Maritim Nusantara: Jejak Sejarah Yang Terhapus_ \[Archipelago Maritime Countries: Erasing Traces of History\] (Yogyakarta: Tiara Wacana, 2008), 73.

[^6]: It should be noted that on 6 February 1819, Sir Stamford Raffles, Sultan Hussein Shah of Johor and Temenggong Abdul Rahman signed a treaty that permitted the British to set up a trading post on a stretch of land in the southern area of Singapore. In August 1824, a second treaty was signed by Sultan Hussein, the Temenggong and Crawfurd, which allowed the British to control the whole island for the purpose of a port that did not charge taxes (Tan and Lim, [_Secrets of Singapore: National Museum_](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/redir/itemdetails?bid=202769140), 24; Priscilla Chia and Trenton James Riggs, “We, the Citizens of Singapore,” in [_Within &amp; Without: Singapore in the World; The World in Singapore_](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/redir/itemdetails?bid=202390216), ed. Pang Eng Fong and Arnoud De Meyer (Singapore: Singapore Management University, 2016, 40. (From National Library Singapore, call no. RSING 959.57 WIT-\[HIS\])). Due to the free trade policy, Singapore saw an influx of new arrivals from Nusantara comprising mainly the Javanese, Boyanese, Minangs, Baweanese, Bugis and Banjarese, who settled in Singapore in pursuit of better lives (Emile Walree and David Va, [_Economic Relations of the Netherlands Indies With Other Far Eastern Countries_](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/redir/itemdetails?bid=5030866) (Amsterdam: National Council for the Netherlands and the Netherlands Indies of the Institute of Pacific Relations, 1935), 6. (From National Library Singapore, call no. RSEA 382.0959805 WAL)

[^7]: In the _Ethnographic Survey of Singapore_ conducted by John Clammer in 1999, there were three main groups within the Malay community identified: Indigenous Malays (Orang Seletar, Orang Kallang and Orang Laut), people from the Malay Peninsula and Indonesians of other non-Malay ethnic groups. As described in 1825 census reports, there were 38 people of Javanese origins living in Singapore who mostly stayed in and around Kampong Glam, working as artisans, gardeners, religious teachers and merchants. There were notable Javanese entrepreneurs such as Haji Yusoff Haji Mohamed Noor, also known as Haji Yusoff “Tali Pinggang” (the belt merchant), Haji Hashim Haji Abdullah of Haji Hasjim Bookstore and Haji Ahmad Sonhadji, religious scholar and former principal of Madrasah Aljunied (Hidayah Amin), [_Bahasa: A Guide to Malay Languages: Banjar, Bawean, Buginese, Javanese, Malay, Minangkabau, Slitar and Tagalog_](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/redir/itemdetails?bid=202890270) (Singapore: Helang Books, 2017), 215–16. (From National Library Singapore, call no. RSING 499.28 HID). In 1825, the Dutch colonial government in Java applied a levy on travel to Mecca for the Hadji, resulting in many Javanese travelling via Singapore instead. Hadji is the annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina (Prick van Wely, F. P. H., _Indische Woorden En Hunne Equivalenten in De Moderne Talen_ (Batavia: G. Kolff &amp; Co., 1903), 21. (From National Library Singapore, call no. RUR 439.31 PRI). Since the 1880s, upon their return from Hadji, many remained in Singapore as there were more job opportunities after western Johor became a business center. These job opportunities were supported by the Dutch East India company or Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie (VOC). As stated in _Soerabaiasch-Handelsblad_, a Dutch magazine published on 15 August 1892 shown on page 71, the British and Dutch had signed an agreement on a commercial ship route that would travel three times a month from Batavia or Surabaya to Singapore, namely the _Speelman_ on 22 August 1892, _Van Diemen_ on 29 August 1892 and _Borneo_ on 1 September 1892 (J. A. Nederbragt, [_Handbook of the Netherlands and Overseas Territories_](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/redir/itemdetails?bid=4117371) (The Hague: Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Nederland, Economic Section, 1931), 376. (From National Library Singapore, call no. RCLOS 949.2 HAN-\[JK\]). In addition, there was to be a monthly mail service from Singapore via Java’s ports to Australia by the Streamers (D. Van Der Zee, _Batavia De Koningin Van Het Oosten_. Rotterdam: Schueler, 1925, 71). In 1922, around 281,000 people, 180,000 of whom were Indonesian, were exploited on the east coast of Sumatra (Deli), leading to thousands of Javanese fleeing to the neighbouring area belonging to British-controlled Malaysia and Singapore (John W. Brown, _World Migration and Labour_ (Amsterdam: Bureau Centrale Informatie van Het Emigratiebestuur, 1926), 98–99; J. F. Niermeyer, _De Oost En De West. Groningen_: Wolters, 1909, 50). Since then, the total population of Singapore almost doubled from 29,984 in 1836 to 59,043 in 1849; of which comprised 1,649 Javanese (Edward Balfour, ed., [_Cyclopædia of India and of Eastern and Southern Asia, Commercial, Industrial and Scientific_](https://catalogue.nlb.gov.sg/search/card?recordId=300064726) (Madras: Printed at the Scottish &amp; Adelphi presses, 1873), 398). (From National Library Singapore, call no. SBG 954 CYC)). By 1891, the number of Javanese had increased to 8,541 in Singapore. During the Japanese Occupation of Indonesia, a thousand Javanese laborers were sent to Singapore prior to being hired for the railroad projects in Thailand (Hidayah Amin, [_Bahasa: A Guide to Malay Languages_](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/redir/itemdetails?bid=202890270), 216)

[^8]: As stated by Rahim (2006:522), there are some areas related to the 19th-century Javanese community living in Singapore, namely Kampong Java (around Arab Street), Kampong Tempei (near today’s Coronation Road), Kampong Chantek (near Binjai Park), Kampong Pachitan (near Kembangan) and various other settlements along Bukit Timah Road. There was a community theater established in the 1840s called Pondok Jawa, located near the Istana Kampong Gelam, which was a cultural venue for Javanese performances such as _wayang kulit_ (shadow puppet theatre), _wayang wong_ (masked drama) and _ketoprak_ (Javanese opera). There was also a Javanese _keramat_ (sacred place) in Singapore, namely the grave of Radin Mas Ayu in Telok Blangah, or in Kampong Radin Mas to be exact. Unfortunately, the _kampong_ was demolished in 1973 to make way for development (Jeanette Chia Hwee Hwee, [_A History of the Javanese and Boyanese in Singapore_](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/redir/itemdetails?bid=202797469) (Singapore: NUS, 1992), 37 (From National Library Singapore, call no. RSING 305.89928095957 CHI); Ibrahim Tahir, ed. [_A Village Remembered Kampong Radin Mas 1800s–1973_](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/redir/itemdetails?bid=200131743) (Singapore: OPUS Editorial Private Limited, 2013, 12. (From National Library Singapore, call no. RSING 959.57 VIL-\[HIS\])). Myth has it that Radin Mas Ayu was a Javanese princess who had suffered greatly during her life (Mohamed Nahar Ros, [_Sacred Places: Keramats in Singapore_](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/redir/itemdetails?bid=202805786) (Singapore: National University of Singapore, 1984), 59. (From National Library Singapore, call no. RSING 305.89928095957 MOH)

[^9]: The origin of the term “Melayu” is still clouded in uncertainty. The earliest mention of “Melayu” is in reference to a kingdom in Jambi, Sumatra, as written in Chinese records in 644 CE, which recounts that an emissary from the “Mo-Lo-Yu” of the Jambi or Batang Hari River in Sumatra visited the Chinese Imperial Court (Hussin Mutalib, [_Singapore Malays: Being Ethnic Minority and Muslim in a Global Citystate_](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/redir/itemdetails?bid=14355014) (New York: Routledge, 2012), 19 (From National Library Singapore, call no. RSING 305.8992805957 HUS); Tham Seong Chee, [_Defining “Malay”_](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/redir/itemdetails?bid=6538629) (Singapore: Department of Malay Studies, National University of Singapore, 1992), 1. (From National Library Singapore, call no. RSING 305.899205957 THA)). As the Malay language is the lingua franca in the Nusantara archipelago, it provides a generalised identity for anyone from Nusantara as being Malay. However, for a long time, the term Malay was never used as a term for ethnic identity until European travellers began to categorise the indigenous people living in Nusantara as Malay. Besides the Malay language, the Melaka Sultanate in the 15th century played a key role in shaping the modern Malay identity through the practice of language (Malay), religion (Islam) and customary traditions (_adat Melayu_). Thus, a Malay is one who professes to being Muslim, speaks the Malay language and adheres to Malay customs (Nicholas J. Long, [_Being Malay in Indonesia: Histories, Hopes, and Citizenship in the Riau Archipelago_](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/redir/itemdetails?bid=200125374) (Singapore: Asian Studies Association of Australia in Association with NUS Press and NIAS Press, 2013), 34.

[^10]: This Facebook group facilitates interactions among the Javanese diaspora on social media, from places such as Suriname, the Netherlands and Malaysia, to Singapore, New Caledonia and Australia. One concrete manifestation of the roots journey was when the Javanese diaspora from across the world were reunited under the spirit of Ngumpulke Balung Pisah. Facebook plays an important role in bringing together disparate diasporic connections in the virtual realm. Therefore, the success of Ngumpulke Balung Pisah (held in 2015), was repeated from 17 to 23 April 2017 in collaboration with the Royal Palace of Yogyakarta, which saw the participation of hundreds from the Javanese diaspora (“Javanese Diaspora Event III ‘Ngumpulke Balung Pisah’.” _JogjaTV_, 23 March 2017)
