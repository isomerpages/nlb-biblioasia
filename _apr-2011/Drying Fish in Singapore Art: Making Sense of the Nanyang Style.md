#### The act of drying fish appears in many works of the Nanyang style. National Art Gallery’s _Yeo Wei Wei_ explores this recurring motif suggests how it can help our understanding of “Nanyang”.

#### **“Nanyang”: Nostalgia and Longing**

The subject of drying fish appears with remarkable frequency in the works of modern Singapore artists in the 1960s and 1970s. During that time, artists such as Chen Chong Swee, Cheong Soo Pieng, Lim Tze Peng and other members of the Ten Men Art Group, travelled to fishing villages in Trengganu, Kelantan, and Kukup. These outdoor sketching trips and the works produced in their course form part of the evolution of the Nanyang style. Finding themselves surrounded by attractive and fresh subject matter, these artists spent their days fruitfully; many sketches were the basis for full-fledged works in oil, watercolour, Chinese ink and colour, and even wood carving.

“Nanyang” literally means “south seas”, yet the term’s significance goes beyond mere geographical denotation. From the time of the earliest *huaqiao* (华侨; emigrants who came largely from southern China), “Nanyang” served as a potent signifier for a certain projected way of life in the tropics, a more rewarding life with less hardship. It was a word loaded with hopes and aspirations, but interestingly, by the early 1950s, it also seemed to evoke longing for an idyllic pastoral paradise in the tropics. The passion for tropical beauty had clearly grown since the 1920s. Back then, the writer Chen Lianqing lamented the absence of “local colour” in the literature of that time: “Look where you will in Mayeur; Chen Chong Swee wrote about Le Mayeur’s exhibition in Singapore in 1938. The spotlight on Bali as a Holy Grail of sorts in the quest for the “Nanyang” in art, shifted to Malaysia in the 1960s. Bali was sought after, but it was also costly to travel there; second-generations artists who aspired towards the Nanyang style found it more economical to travel to Malaysia.

In a way, the “Nanyang” art of the sixties and seventies acts as a mirror, catching reflections of the responses by artists and the community to dramatic political changes on both sides of the Strait. Singapore’s relationship with Malaysia was being dramatically reconfigured. In Singaporean artists’ representations of Malaysian fishing village life during that time, there is no shadow of separation; “Nanyang” continues to encompass the nations of Singapore and Malaysia, uniting them through nostalgia and new works of art. On their visits to fishing villages on the east coast of Malaysia and other nearby places in the 1960s and 1970s, the artists were attracted by sights that no longer existed in Singapore due to its rapid industrialisation. Chen Chong Swee had painted the fishing villages in the west coast of Singapore in the 1960s, for example in *Singapore West Coast* (1962). However, the development of the west coast led to the disappearance of these scenes and the artist began to travel to the east coast of Malaysia, often accompanied by his students such as Tan Teo Kwang (personal communication in Mandarin with Chen Chi Sing, 21 January 2011). In the colophon of his painting, *South Islanders* (1970), Chen Chong Swee celebrates the peace and harmony of village life in the Southern Islands:

The fisher folk live in simple joy and     harmony<br>No cars, no dust, no 
noise<br>One might ask if civilisation 
brings any good<br>The question 
persists, and this picture was made<br> 
(Chen, 2010/Trans. Yeo, 2011)

In another painting, *Fishing Village* (1981), the title in Chinese literally translates as “Happy Fishing Picture”; the first two characters “渔乐” （*yule*） have the same sound as the characters for recreation “娱乐”, a pun expressing Chen Chong Swee’s appreciation of the leisurely and relaxed pace of life in Kota Bahru. In the foreground fishes are laid out to dry.

Born in the 1910s, 1920s and 1930s, these artists grew up knowing Singapore as part of Malaya. Scenes of drying fish were common in Malaysia, a familiar familial country, a place that was as homely as Singapore during the artists’ childhood. By the mid eighties, the appeal of the subject had begun to fade. However, the selection of Cheong Soo Pieng’s painting *Drying Salted Fish* (1978), featuring a scene from Trengganu, as part of the re-design of the Singapore fifty-dollar note in 1999 seemed to be a silent acknowledgement that Singapore had once been part of Malaya.

#### **“Nanyang”: Phenomenology**

The “south” (南，*nan*) in “Nanyang” refers to coordinates taken from the perspective of China.The term gestures towards an Elsewhere situated south from the mainland, serving as a catchall for a region made up of diverse cultures and communities. The artists who pursued the Nanyang style were not unaware of the cultural richness and diversity of their region. The genesis of the Nanyang style is seeded upon awareness and openness to difference: the different light in the tropics; the different colours of other races in their skin tones and dress; the different hues, forms, and textures of tropical plants and fruits. As first-generation artist Liu Kang put it:

We live at the equator where there is strong sunlight,<br> lush vegetation, and varied and exciting ways of<br> living. Such materials are suited for portrayal in<br> forceful colours and with robust lines. In addition, the<br> work of some artists is permeated with the stylised<br> shapes of modern art, enabling their styles to be<br> completely transformed. The batik artists’ elevation of<br> a craft into fine art, thus giving it a new lease of life, is<br> a contribution that we should be proud of. (Liu, 1969/<br> Trans. Tan, 2011).
