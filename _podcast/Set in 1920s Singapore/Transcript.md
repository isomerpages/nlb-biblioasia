<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>He nearly died twice when he was here.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Did he?</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>Yeah, he did. He was on a river down in Sarawak.
And this bore, really bizarre bore tidal wave they have sometimes coming
through the river, came down and washed him out and Gerald. And Gerald
actually had a heart attack.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>No, it was really horrific. Oh, when I think
about it now, everything had just… you can imagine, they’re on this kind
of barge thing, and they’re down with like there are 15 people that are
taking care of them. And then this wave comes out of nowhere. They have
no idea about it. Then they’re all washed out. Maugham comes up for air,
and he can see Gerald, and he can see that he’s panicking and so he grabs
him, takes him to the shore, and then Gerald Haxton has a heart attack,
and he nearly loses him.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Oh my goodness.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>And Maugham thankfully is a doctor and resuscitates
him, and he’s okay. But that really did a lot of… I can imagine that would
have been quite traumatic. And then also in Bangkok, in Thailand, he got
malaria and he nearly died. So, yeah, I definitely think these trips definitely
changed him. They also gave him a great insight and perception into life
here.

<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>You are listening to <em>BiblioAsia+</em>, a
podcast produced by the National Library of Singapore. At <em>BiblioAsia</em>,
we tell stories about Singapore’s past. Some familiar, others forgotten,
all fascinating.</p>
<p>When the well-known writer Somerset Maugham came to this region in the
early 1920s, he was welcomed by the expatriate community here. They were
pleased to have a celebrity writer and playwright in their midst. However,
after his collection of short stories was published, they were less pleased.
The people in his stories, expats living in Malaya, don’t come off looking
too good.</p>
<p>Cowardice, snobbery, drink, adultery, murder. Great stuff to read about,
not so great if this is what you and your friends are going to be known
for. Tracey Morton, an Irish-Australian writer based in Singapore, is a
fan of Maugham. She has written short stories, as well as a radio play
about him. She has also written about Maugham in <em>BiblioAsia</em>, and
she is here today to share with us about Maugham and about his relationship
with Singapore.</p>
<p>Welcome to <em>BiblioAsia</em>+, Tracey. How have you been?</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>I’m really good. Thank you, Jimmy. Thanks so
much for having me.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Thank you for coming down. It’s really a pleasure.
I love <em><a href="https://catalogue.nlb.gov.sg/search/card?recordId=205876388" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Someone Is Coming</a></em>.
I love how it’s written. And I’m really glad that you were able to write
about Maugham for us, for <em>BiblioAsia</em>. I think, you know, it’s definitely
fair to say that Maugham’s not so well-known now as he was before the war.
So maybe you can tell our listeners a little bit more about Maugham and
why you think we should pay attention to him.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>So, I don’t think he’s well-known here after
the war, but I think elsewhere in the world, he was well-known after the
war. Actually, he wrote <em><a href="https://catalogue.nlb.gov.sg/search/card?recordId=203553635" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">The Razor’s Edge</a>. </em>That
came out just after the Second World War. And that really is seen as one
of the best novels he’s ever written. Then he went on to write a lot of
his non-fiction, where he’s discussing his own working routines with the
summing up, and he releases the writer’s notebook and there’s a lot that
comes after the war. But I understand why he’s not well-known here after
the Second World War and that’s partly to do with what he did when he came
here.</p>
<p>So Maugham was actually born in France, to English parents. He lived there
for the first 10 years of his life. And then he went to live in England.
Unfortunately, his parents both passed away. Then he was sent to live in
Whitstable in the UK. He struggled a bit with his language because he was
brought up speaking French. And unfortunately, when he speaks English,
he stammers. So he has a bit of a speech impediment. Anyway, despite all
that, over the course of his life, he’s written 20 novels, published 9
collections of short stories, written 31 plays.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Very, very prolific.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>Oh my God, incredible. I mean, his work ethic
is just insane. So, he was really well-known. Actually, just before he
came here, he’d just published <em><a href="https://catalogue.nlb.gov.sg/search/card?recordId=203527078" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">The Moon and Sixpence</a></em>,
which is a beautiful novel that I’d love to read, go back and have a good
look at again. And it’s about Paul Gauguin, the painter, and he went down
to the South Seas, just before he got here and researched that kind of
story and got the idea and then wrote that book. So when he came here,
they were showing his plays in the Victoria Theatre, so everyone knew who
he was.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Right. Okay, so he was well-known by the time
he got here. Why was he here though, by the way?</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>Because he was in search of his “Eastern Colour”,
according to the <em>Straits Times</em>. I think he came here for many different
reasons, but he really loved travelling. And he was here with his partner,
Gerald Haxton. Maugham was a homosexual, but he was married to a woman
called Syrie Wellcome. But it was a very unhappy marriage, and I think
Maugham had actually believed that she had kind of trapped him into marriage
because she became pregnant with his child.</p>
<p>And so unfortunately, she was very much in love with him. And he did not
love her so much. So it was quite tragic for her, but she ended up creating
her life for herself. She was a great interior designer. My mother is an
interior designer. Maugham kind of crosses our paths. Syrie Maugham actually
is claimed with inventing the white room.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>So the idea that you paint your walls white,
and you have very white furniture and this kind of minimalist space almost.
So yeah, she was, and she was the first one to really start painting furniture
and bringing this to London, which before then was very full of heavy woods
and tweeds and yeah, wallpapers and William Morris. So she kind of shifted
that. So Maugham came here really as this kind of way of trying to, making
excuses to travel a lot. And because he was a homosexual, there was a certain
freedom in travelling with his partner at that particular time, especially
in Asia, they were very open to you being, to coming with your partner.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>His partner wasn’t allowed into the UK, was
he?</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>Yeah, no, so he was arrested for gross indecency,
back in 1915, not with Maugham. Maugham was off travelling at that stage.
And he actually was banned then from going to the United Kingdom. He was
an American himself. Gerald Haxton is from San Francisco. He was also previously
married and had a child. But unfortunately, there’s hardly anything we
can find in the archives about him.</p>
<p>So they came together here and they’d actually been a few years previous
to the South Seas. And they’d gone to, down to Polynesia, Tahiti, Hawaii,
and they spent a lot of time together. And that’s the kind of time where
Maugham kind of really fell in love with Gerald Haxton. And they decided
that Gerald Haxton would be his private secretary and would travel around
with him and aid him. Because Maugham was a very shy man. He was a snob,
which isn’t very likable. But Haxton was the kind of polar opposite, incredibly
handsome, dashing, liked to drink, liked to laugh, liked to gamble. And
he was the one that would spend all the time in the bars and in the clubs
talking to everybody, and Maugham was just off in his room writing and
reading.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Oh, right.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>So, in a way, Haxton was the one that went
out and got Maugham all the stories, and then it was up to Maugham to write
them.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Right. Maugham wrote <em><a href="https://catalogue.nlb.gov.sg/search/card?recordId=12536719" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">The Casuarina Tree</a></em>,
and there were six stories. Well, of the six, which ones really had impact
over here?</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>Yeah. He’d actually got in trouble with <em><a href="https://catalogue.nlb.gov.sg/search/card?recordId=5365423" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">The Painted Veil</a></em>,
which is another novel of his where he based it in Hong Kong, and that’s
where he did not change the names at all. He was actually sued for not
changing the name. So he had to pay this poor man that he’d taken his life
and reworked and shown everything and paid him $250. On top of that, the
Hong Kong government got very upset with the depiction of Hong Kong and
turned around and said we don’t want you to refer to Hong Kong like this.
We are not this kind of frivolous society. How dare you project us as this?</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Hang on, all this happened before he came to
Singapore?</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>No, so this happened actually on his second
trip. This would have happened in ’25. And, we demand that you change the
name of Hong Kong.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Wow. Does he?</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>Yeah, he has to.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Yeah, so what was it changed to?</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>Tching-Yen.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Alright, so he creates a completely fictitious
city. But it was said that as a writer, he wasn’t particularly stylish.
He had a tendency towards cliché. Was that true, I mean?</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>Yeah, I mean horribly, there he was referred
to as class two, division one by the Bloomsbury squad. I think about that
particular time, yeah. But I think for a modern-day audience, they would
love him. One of the greatest compliments that Maugham ever got in his
life was when he volunteered as a Red Cross ambulance driver, and he was
in Flanders.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>World War One.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>Yeah, he would take the soldiers back, and
then sometimes he would stay and he would go to soldiers, and they would
dictate letters for him to write home. Anyway, one of the soldiers got
wind that he was the famous Somerset Maugham. Could you even imagine sitting
there as a famous author?</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>“Dear Mum.”</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>Yeah! You can’t believe he’s writing this letter
to you. And then, he said, “Oh, Mr. Maugham, I didn’t realise it was you.”
And he said, “Oh, yes.” And he said, “You know, I just love, I love, love,
love your stories.” And he said, “Oh, thank you very much.” And he said,
“Because you know why? I don’t have to pick up a dictionary to read them.”</p>
<p>And I do think there’s a lot of truth in that. So he really wrote for
the common man, as pretentious as that sounds now, probably. But he liked
to show people for what they were. He was very observant. He trained as
a doctor. He was an avid note-taker. He really wanted to highlight the
flaws in us. And I think that’s because of how he felt internally and how
flawed he felt from being a homosexual. He was deathly afraid of being
imprisoned. And I think that’s partly to do with the fact that he grew
up, when he was young, that Oscar Wilde had gone through that.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>So he witnessed what happened to Oscar Wilde?</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>I don’t think he met Wilde. But he knew Henry
James and they were all deathly afraid. They were so afraid about being
imprisoned. So that was the whole idea. So I feel like Maugham hid a lot
of himself. And in his way, the way he writes is that he’s trying to really
highlight the flaws that we all have as individuals that don’t come to
the surface. And even though we want to make changes and do things, sometimes
we don’t because of just who we are as humans.</p>
<p>It’s really interesting. I mean, he is referred to as, you know, looking
at people like as cases almost like they’re in a laboratory. But as like
someone that’s really into history and loves source material, I think what
he’s given us is a gift, because the depiction of what we get is very true
to what really happened and how these people really live their lives.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Do you think in today’s society, his work, if
it had been written this way, how do you think it would be received?</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>I feel like today, I think it’d be received
pretty well. We get away with a lot more now. If he’d written about real
people, they could’ve, they’d probably be spinning it to their own way,
you know, to their own advantage. They would be making TikToks about it.
Hashtag Maugham represented by Maugham hashtag, you know, like, but you
know, the younger audience for sure. I mean, they’re so clever about twisting
things, right? And looking at stuff. So I think in a way people would enjoy
that. I mean, obviously there’s certain generations who would be horrified
that he’d written about them in that particular way. But that’s the great
thing about modern society, right? Is that we can manipulate things to
any way that we really want to be perceived.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>He was very well-known for his short stories
that were based in Asia, but beyond that, do you think this time in Asia
changed him, do you think?</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>Absolutely. He nearly died twice when he was
here.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Did he?</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>Yeah, he did. He was on a river down in Sarawak.
And this bore, bizarre bore tidal wave they have sometimes coming through
the river, came down, and washed him out and Gerald. And Gerald actually
had a heart attack.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>No, it was really horrific. Oh, when I think
about it now, everything had just… you can imagine they’re on this kind
of barge thing and they’re down with like, there are 15 people that are
taking care of them. And then this wave comes out of nowhere. They have
no idea about it. Then they’re all washed out. Maugham comes up for air,
and he can see Gerald, and he can see that he’s panicking, and so he grabs
him, takes him to the shore, and then Gerald Haxton has a heart attack,
and he nearly loses him.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Oh my goodness.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>And Maugham thankfully is a doctor and resuscitates
him and he’s okay. But that really did a lot of, I can imagine that would
have been quite traumatic. And then also in Bangkok, in Thailand, he got
malaria and he nearly died. So, yeah, I definitely think these trips definitely
changed him. They also gave him a great insight and perception into life
here. And he came out with, I think, probably the best, some of the best
literature he’s ever written and probably some of the most critical.</p>
<p>Now the thing is about Maugham, like most people don’t think he’s being
very critical. He was also heavily criticised in the UK when these stories
came out because he’d taken people at their value. But they’d also said
on the other side, because, you know, everyone’s always has to have the
complaint about something, that he wasn’t critical enough of the English
government out here. He wasn’t critical enough of the colonials.</p>
<p>And funny, because when I read it, I think he’s incredibly critical of
the colonial. And I mean, there’s also people saying that he didn’t represent
the locals enough, which, you know, is fair. But then I would say to counteract
that, I think the way that he actually projects the locals, they always
seem to have the upper hand. They have this inner knowledge of how to live
in this world, you know, with their whole voodoo and their supernatural
spells and the Bhoma. But they always seem to be able to, to know really
what’s going on and to manipulate those kind of English colonials who are
running around trying to rule them. But they always seem to have this upper
hand.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Just because of their sort of local knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>Yeah, exactly. And from having the environment,
but also people weren’t stupid. You know, and he always makes out too,
that the local Chinese population, they were like so superior almost that
they believed that they were almost superior to the English Colonials.
I mean, they had their own club, right? The millionaires’ club here in
Singapore. I mean, that’s back then. That’s a pretty snobby name for a
club. You have to be a millionaire to be part of this club, right?</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Sadly, not a club I will ever be in.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>Not me either!</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>How did you become interested in Maugham? It
seemed like an odd sort of thing to be odd sort of writer to be interested
in.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>First time I read Maugham, I was living in
Hong Kong. My husband decided that we should go to Paris. We didn’t have
a child by then. So we went off to Paris. My parents came down, walking
along. I mean, it’s a typical story. I mean, it’s so cliché. It’s such
a Maugham story, actually. And I was walking along and then I see the Shakespeare
and Company Bookshop, which is world-famous, incredible bookshop. And we’re
outside and they have a second-hand rail and every book is one euro. And
I’m standing there and I’m like, “Ooh, let me go and have a look.”</p>
<p>And by that stat, I was really into Graham Greene at that particular time
and Orwell. So they always make claim that Maugham was so inspiring to
them. And then I see <em>The Razor’s Edge</em> by Maugham and I pick it up
and it’s probably, I don’t know, it’s falling apart, the edition. And I’m
like, you know what, I’m going to give it a try anyway I read it, and it
just changed my life and just thought, “Oh my God, this guy can write.”
And the way that he told the story, what happens to the characters. I mean,
it’s just beautiful.</p>
<p>Anyway, I went back to Hong Kong, and I said to some of my friends who
are great readers, and I said, “Oh, have you guys read this?” and they’re
like, “Yeah, have you read the <em>Far Eastern Tales</em>?” And I went,
no. And then I read them and thought, Oh my God. And you know what really
clinched it for me is he was writing about characters back in the 1920s
that I still felt, still felt like I was meeting them.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Oh, right. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>And today even, like there were certain instances
when you come across expats and there’s a slight, there is something very
Maugham about them and their perception. And I’m Irish, by the way, I’m
not English in that way, but I do think that there is this whole, very
closed expatriate communities. And it’s not just, it’s across the board.
It’s not just the English or the Irish or whatever.</p>
<p>And I just thought, gosh, he’s really got them. Really incredibly perceptive
writer, like, without really even having a background in psychology, but
he really just gets people. And that’s because the way that he could observe
people, and the way they sat, and the way they said things, and the way
they didn’t say things, and the mannerisms, it’s incredibly insightful.
And also great for a writer starting off to read him. You know, it’s always
Raymond Carver, and it’s always Chekhov, and I mean, they’re both incredible
writers, but I think sometimes Maugham’s lost when he shouldn’t be.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>But of course, he was writing at a time where
other major English writers like D. H. Lawrence.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>Yeah, Lawrence was a big critic of Maugham,
but Virginia Woolf too, right? But he loved all that though, and he loved
writing about them, and he loved reading them and there’s a lovely story
about him and having dinner with Virginia Woolf one night. And this is
towards the end of her life unfortunately and he felt like she was a bit
sensitive and a bit off, so he asked to walk her home.</p>
<p>And she said, “No, no, I’m fine. I’m fine.” But he just felt like there
was something a bit strange. So he actually followed her home. He kept
a distance. No, just to make sure that he was okay, because he could feel
like there was something maybe going on with her. That’s the observation
of him being really sensitive and aware of what other people, and I largely
think that’s down to, you know, his childhood, what he went through as
a child, and his young life, and him being closeted homosexual, unfortunately
kind of in a way, but not really, and just being aware of how fragile we
are.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>You’ve been inspired to write short stories
by Maugham. Can you tell us a little bit about what you’ve written?</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>Yeah, so I’ve written quite a lot actually,
and I’m constantly writing it off and on for 10 years now, where it’s actually,
we’re having conversations together, he’s teaching me how to write where
he’s pulling me up on things a lot of the time.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Really?</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>And yeah, but then we have arguments and then
he leaves the room and then I don’t see him for a couple of months and
then he comes back. So it’s like that, but it’s a nice thing that I have
with him.</p>
<p>I wrote “Willie’s Chinese Funeral Urn”<em>,</em> which was in the <em>Best Asian Short Stories</em>.
I actually told it from the point of view of this ceramic jar that he buys
that is a funeral urn. And this funeral urn watches him instead and observes
him and stays with him in his life and he buys him in Singapore, and then
he takes him all the way back to his house in France, and Gerald Haxton
is still alive.</p>
<p>And then the Second World War comes, Maugham has to shut down the house
in France, and he goes to America for a period of time. And then when Maugham
unwraps the vase at the funeral towards the end, he starts crying because
he realised he remembers Singapore and Gerald and their time here. And
he’s very emotional. And the urn is just looking at him like, “Oh, I’m
so glad to see somebody else and not be stuck away.” And then eventually
when Maugham dies and he’s cremated, then the ashes are put in the urn
and then they’re buried together at Maugham’s old school in Canterbury.
So I really wanted to do that because I really wanted to play around with
different voices, using items that, you know.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>It is a bit unusual.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>No, it is. It is. But I like kind of like unusual
ways to go into stories because most stories have been told, right? So
it’s trying to tell a story in a different kind of way.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Okay, we’re going to get back into that, but
because you write crime fiction and you also teach crime fiction writing.
And you also write historical fiction and obviously with historical fiction,
one needs to do a lot of research. But I think in one of your crime fiction
writing courses, you also mentioned that historical research is also important.
Why is that? Why is historical research important in crime fiction writing?</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>I think it is mainly for inspiration, to help
us form [ideas], especially as crime writers, because I think if you look
at past crimes, then they’re kind of plotted out for you, so you don’t
really have to get stuck there with a plot, because a lot of crime writing
is to do with plotting. So I think that looking at old historical cases,
cold cases, everything like that is so fascinating. How people died, if
they disappeared, what happened, who was involved. And I think there’s
a wealth of information there for writers and it helps you to determine
kind of what crime story you’re going to tell yourself.</p>
<p>So I taught a course with the Singapore Book Council, and we came here
to work in the archives to try and find old cases. And the idea behind
that was to go into the archives, find old cases, or maybe cold cases from
the past, and look at them, think about writing how we would reinterpret
them for modern day or not, or if we take them and work with them in another
time period.</p>
<p>One of the girls who came, she found this really great kind of case about
girl gangs in the 1950s here in Singapore. And Singapore wasn’t like Singapore
is now, right? So it’s a bit, it’s a bit different. Yeah, a bit dodgy.
So she also came out with a statistic saying that only like 47 percent
of people said they felt safe. So I really feel like that’s amazing compared
to now where we feel so safe.</p>
<p>So anyway, she found these girl gangs. They, I think, I can’t remember
the colour, but they all had the same tattoo of having a black butterfly
or red butterfly. And they were notorious. Apparently they all got together,
and it was started with the idea that it was for girls that had been done
wrong by, like, you know, that they went after their ex-partners or their
ex-boyfriends and they attacked them and they all came together and did
it.</p>
<p>So it’s kind of incredibly feminist, bizarre, volatile movement that was
quickly shut down, obviously, because the girls got pretty powerful pretty
fast and got a big following, as you can imagine. So then we sat with that
and we talked about that and she was going to work on that. She was actually
a playwright. And then we were talking about different ways of telling
that story. And I said, you know, you could actually take that story now
and write from the point of view of the woman’s granddaughter finding this
out about her grandmother, wouldn’t that be a great story?</p>
<p>I mean, I found a really good case recently too, about a Detective Williams,
who was one of the first detectives here in Singapore. I actually found
the photograph and everything. I’m so excited.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>This is an actual person?</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>Yeah! He was in the first detective branch
here. I found this really cool case of him, and back then they wrote really
small crime reports. They weren’t big, so they weren’t great about giving
you information. I think it’s 1897 and he’s just hanging out in Tanjong
Pagar at the ports, and then suddenly he looks at this guy and he thinks,
“Oh, I know that guy. He’s been wanted for murder for the last 10 years.”
And then he picks them up and he arrests him. And it is that guy that murdered
two people in Penang back in, you know.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Wow!</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>And I was thinking, oh, because that’s a very
Sherlock Holmes thing to do, right? The power of deduction. But then also
like how, what kind of skill did he have? But then it turns out that this
man had a big scar from the knife fight. So then I was like, oh okay. But
still it was a nice way to get into an idea. And then I worked with him
and now I’m working with him in this new novel that I’m writing.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Fantastic. Your new novel is going to be set
in Singapore then?</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>Yeah, it is. So it’s set in Singapore and in
Australia.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>What period?</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>So just after the Second World War. Yeah, it’s
a very chaotic time. I want it really chaotic. We were talking about that
too, about crime writing, is that technology, is it our friend or foe when
we come to crime writing? Because especially in Singapore, when we’re inundated
with cameras everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Right, right, right. And your watchers are tracking
you.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>Exactly, I mean, god, you know, how can they
get away with anything anymore, right? But I mean, there are ways. I think
there’s a great novel to be written about scams, scam centers, the call
centers. I think that’s a really good novel to come out of that soon, I
would hope. I think that’s a really interesting way of looking about how
they manipulate or tick, but I’m just not that tech-savvy to sit there
and write that.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>I’d like to ask you about <em>Someone Is Coming</em>.
It was published in 2022 and has been optioned. And it’s very interesting
to me for a number of reasons, because one, it’s also set in the same period
that a lot of Maugham’s stories are set. I think I remember Maugham was
mentioned in the novella.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>He is.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>And also, one of the main literary devices is
that an interviewer from the oral history archive goes around and interviews
the main protagonists in this story, which is quite interesting because
I don’t think the oral history interviewers typically get so much ink.
Tell me how this idea came to you and how it all spilled out.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>So, this whole book was inspired just by a
lecture I was doing my master’s at Cambridge in crime and thriller writing,
and they were talking about the unreliable narrator. And I started thinking
about that. And I was writing another book at the time, but anyway, because
I’d done so much research on Maugham, because I was doing a documentary
about him, I had all this information in my head, but also I was thinking
about where did Maugham get his inspiration from? And then I go to the
archives and I’m searching up like plantations, because there’s a lot of
plantation managers who were murdered in the stories. And so I started
researching that, came up with like 16 cases in a 20-year period.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Yeah, yeah, yeah. It’s just ridiculous, right?</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>Of plantation managers who were murdered. That’s
insane. It’s a lot of people to be murdered. So I started looking at that.
And as I said before, they weren’t massive write-ups about what was really
happening.</p>
<p>But then, you know, you could read between the lines. Some of them apparently
were apparent suicide, but they always love to blame a Chinese gang. Then
I began thinking, like, God, come on, like, there has to be something else
going here. Like, it’s something really weird. Maybe there’s something
more sinister going on.</p>
<p>And I was reading a lot about the young children being trafficked up and
down the streets too. That was a massive thing from the orphanages. And
yeah, it was a really strange time. It was like the Wild West, I feel,
that particular time, unfortunately.</p>
<p>Anyway, during this time too, I was listening to a lot of oral testimonies.
I was trying to grab everything I could from the Singapore archives, and
I was living in Copenhagen at that particular time, it was before I moved
here. But I had been coming here often, and it was during COVID, and thank
God for those archives being online. I was listening every day.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>So were you listening, or were you reading them?</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>I was [doing] both. It was a lot of materials,
from the newspapers, but then I was also listening and I feel like there’s
so much in the oral archives. Testimonies. I just love it. And I love it
for so many reasons. I think Maugham would also really love it. But I love
listening to how people are being interviewed. I love how it’s like Maugham,
you know, like what people are saying, how they’re saying it, if they pause,
what they’re not saying. If they get uncomfortable, they clear their throat.
Sometimes they get angry with the interviewer, which I think is really
fascinating, too, especially the old ones. Like, they’re really good. You
can just see this older person gets, you know, “I don’t want to talk about
that.” Like, “I said that already.” But they’re really interesting. So
I started thinking about that.</p>
<p>There was a few of them that were particularly good about remembering
growing up in plantations. And there was one where he was a very frail
man and he was remembering about snakes and the tigers. And then I was
just listening and it was really gripping for me. And I just thought, God,
this is so amazing.</p>
<p>And what’s he going to say next? And, oh, wow, I would love to interview
someone like this. And then I thought, that’s a great way of trying to
get someone to talk about the past, especially sometimes people can agree
to do something like that. But then when they’re there, it’s very different,
and especially I’ve been listening to the ones recently about the Second
World War, and there’s a lot of tears by very proud men, which is really
also quite harrowing to listen to. But really important. And so I began
to think this is a really good way of… because oral testimonies are stories.
It’s a good source. I mean, it is the source material, even though it’s
a lot many years later, but there’s so much in it.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>No, it’s lovely. It’s very rich.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>But the thing is, what I also remembered was
how we interpret memory. I know that certain things from my childhood,
you know, I would make claim that I was wearing a pink dress, but then
if I looked at a photograph, it was a blue dress. And I feel like small
stuff like that, where you do misinterpret memories, and how much do you
really remember? And how much do you suppress?</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>You’ve got a book coming up, <em>The Coffee Shop Masquerade</em>,
in which you’ve included a quote from Maugham at the beginning. It goes,
“Culture is a mask that hides their faces, here people show themselves
bare.” So here, meaning Hong Kong.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>Yep. It’s the kind of idea that when you’re
away from home, you become somebody else.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Somebody you hope to be?</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>Well, I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Or is it the filth thing?</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>I don’t know. I mean, I feel like you’re not
bound by your social constraints at home, by the certain ways of....</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>You reinvent yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>Yeah, you can reinvent yourself, for sure,
in a good way, in a bad way. And then also, you probably put on a bit more
of a mask because you’re a bit vulnerable. You’re away from home, you’re
in a different situation, things are different, you’re coming across different
sorts of people that you don’t normally come across. And how that does
really interact and play with, you know, and especially particular times
in your life and how you’re feeling. So I really wanted to work with that
whole idea. It is a very literary, contemporary novel.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Tell us about it.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>Well, it’s full of a lot of different characters.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Is it a novel?</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>It is a novel. There is a mask actually that
features in it and this mask has a spirit inside and he’s kind of overlooking.
He’s left in the coffee shop one day, and he’s looking about what’s going
on.</p>
<p>And so it’s working with an object too, that’s looking at us instead of
us looking at it. Every chapter has a quote from the <em>Tao Te Ching</em>,
the Tao.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>So one of the chapters is called “Sincere Words
Are Not Pretty, Pretty Words Are Not Sincere”. And there’s another chapter
called “Good Travellers Need No Tracks”. And I really wanted to kind of
use that to kind of show how we are, how strange kind of forces, that sometimes
we’re not really conscious of, but still kind of lead us in our life.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Is it set in a contemporary period?</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>So it is. I did set it in a contemporary period.
It was kind of working with the idea about Maugham. There’s a mixture of
people in it. It’s expats, it’s locals [and it’s] the mask. We have this
crazy character called the Monkey King, who’s running around trying to
find the mask. And he’s linking them all. It sounds really crazy and abstract,
but I hope it has relevance to where we are today. And just about the idea
of letting go of probably the myths of our past, like the gods that we
used to worship. So I really, I wanted to look at that. I really, I like
that kind of idea myth. I actually put that in <em>Someone Is Coming</em> as
well about the Pied Piper.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>So <em>The Coffee Shop Masquerade</em> is scheduled
to come out in 2025?</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>Yeah, 2025. I’m hoping that we’ll launch it
at the Hong Kong Literary Festival.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Okay. Well, good luck. We’ve sort of come to
the end of like the substantial part of the podcast interview, which is
where we just sit down and we just talk about things. So you’re a podcast
host yourself. Tell us about <em>The Asian Bookshelf</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>We set it up for the Southeast Asia literary
scene. We wanted to go into every different region and to talk about what
was being written and who’s running the kind of literary scene here. So
the first season was based in Singapore. We discussed some great novels
that are written. We talked to some writers, we talked to Alex from the
Book Bar and William from the Book Council. And we ended up talking to
LaSalle about creative writing. So we kind of want to get like a whole
thing. It’s also interesting when you’re doing a podcast about what’s lacking
in Singapore literary scene.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>So what is lacking?</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>Money.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Yes, I was going to say that. Isn’t that true
everywhere?</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>I know, right? Oh my God. Bookshops!</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Yeah. Oh my God. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>I’m really scared about that. And you know
what, and we were talking before and I think that, you know, when you go
to somewhere like Kinokuniya on the weekends, and it is packed. It’s not
like there’s not a demand.</p>
<p>And I actually think what Alex is doing at the Book Bar is really amazing.
He’s setting up events and he’s setting up events where you come together
and you read, well you buy a ticket, you come together, I think it’s called
Bookworm Banter. Come together, buy a ticket, and you sit and you read
for 45 minutes.</p>
<p>Then you can talk for 15 minutes. Then you’re back to reading again. And
then you talk more. So the idea is that it’s a safe space to come and talk
about literature without being in a bar. I mean, you can drink, alcohol
is served there, or you don’t have to drink and there’s no pressure, right?
And you’re taking away from the materialism of Singapore, you know, like
shops and clothes buying, and it kind of puts you in a different space
where you can actually come and talk about literature.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Or you can share?</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>Yeah, but exactly. And I feel like there should
be more of that, because we do have a lot of younger generation that need
that interaction with each other. I mean, there’s a loneliness epidemic,
right? Everywhere. And I think that it really helps to come together, especially
if you’re into graphic novels or if you’re into any kind of literature.
If you’re starting off wanting to write yourself, you’re doing poetry.
I mean, it’s so powerful, right? To come together and talk.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>I agree. I mean, there’s definitely a problem
in Singapore where, you know, bookshops are dying left, right and centre.
We’re left with very, very few.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>Yeah. I mean, but you have the amazing library
though, right?</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>We do. Thank you very much for entirely my effort.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>You did so well. No, but I mean, it’s such
an incredible, I mean, it’s a wonderful library. I’ve used it so many times
and just sat there for hours and I do love it. It’s a different kind of
energy. So when you’re in the library, you’re kind of more focused and
you’re sitting there. It’s also like working here in the archives, like
there’s a different kind of energy and it would depend on what you want
to do.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>No, but it is different because when you go
to a bookshop, you can like, “Oh, I can buy this book.” I end up spending
a lot of money because my daughter will take me to a bookshop. And [I’m]
like, “Can’t you just borrow it from the library? Please, please just borrow
it.” “No, no, I want to own it.” It’s like, oh my God, this is so expensive.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>I know.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>But yes, I do buy books as well. You’re a podcast
host. I’m learning to be a podcast host. So give me some of your tips.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>I think you do exceptionally well. Like I’ve
listened to a few of them recently. And no, they’re good.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>They’re particularly good if you need to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>Oh, no, no, no. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>You need to be lulled into.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>No, I actually think, I just love the fact
you’re even wanting to have the conversations about, you know, these kind
of aspects of Singapore. I mean, it’s so incredible. I think that sometimes
podcast hosts, especially modern-day podcast hosts, who probably don’t
talk about literature or talking about other things, like to make it about
themselves. It becomes very kind of egotistical, because I think when you’re
a podcast host, your ego has to be left at the door, really. It’s really
about your guest coming there to shine. Do you know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>I’m very humble.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>You are, incredibly. You let me talk. We’ve
never met before today, but I feel like I know you, Jimmy, so it’s fine.
But like, you know, meeting people beforehand, making sure that they want
to talk about these certain things, because you never know what you’re
going to get, and unfortunately, like academics for most of the time, they’re
lovely and writers are great. But sometimes we can be really introverted
and strange and very off about things and very nervous.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>I personally think it’s that chemistry really
makes a difference, because I think people can hear it as well, if two
people are talking to get along.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>Yeah, 100 percent.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Okay, here’s a question. If you could have dinner
with Somerset Maugham, what would you ask him?</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>I would ask him if he wasn’t so afraid of being
outed, what would he have done differently? I’m sure he would have travelled
though. I don’t know how much life would have changed for him. But would
he have written things differently? Because I feel like part of the reason
that he wasn’t so critical of the British here and the government and the
way things were run was because he was afraid of then going back to the
UK and being destroyed and being imprisoned or arrested.</p>
<p>I know that he regretted not going to India and spending more time. He
regrets not hiring a whole train, like renting a whole train, so he could
have gone up and down India. That’s one of his things. No, I mean, I feel
like I’ve read about him so much and gone through such a rabbit hole with
him that I feel like I do know quite a lot, but I do think that, if he
wasn’t afraid…</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>But he would have written things very, very
differently, and maybe not to our benefit, right?</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>Maybe, but maybe he would have pushed himself
then and been a bit more of the contemporaries around that time. Maybe
he would have been more of a modernist writer instead, it’s just like he
really kept within this kind of realism realm. Actually, my favourite short
story from him is called “The Unconquered”, which isn’t based here. It’s
a really weird, dark story from Maugham, and it’s about a German soldier
going to a French village.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>During the Second World War?</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>During the Second World War, and he’s trying
to, well he’s not trying, he gets the French girl where he attacks her,
but then he kind of wants her to fall in love with him and get married
to him, and he can’t really understand why she’s not agreeing to this.
She should be flattered, I mean, he’s amazing. And that story is really
powerful. And I think it’s the first time and probably one of the only
really times that I’ve seen a man write about a man in that way, where
he just got it. Like how you can have a certain male who thinks they’re
entitled to you without question and he’s so unapologetic. And there’s
such truth in that, but that’s up to, you know, that was obviously inspired
by something he’d seen and these individuals that he’d seen, and it’s really
harrowing. It’s a really difficult story and very unlike him.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Okay. What’s the title of the story?</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>The Unconquered.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Okay, last question. Crime writing is...</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>Oh, crime writing is fun. I really like crime
writing. I didn’t start off initially as a crime writer. Okay. I wanted
to be a literary fiction person.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Obviously there’s much more credibility, right?</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>I know, but I write a lot. But I have to say,
so I got to be really honest here. When I went to do my master’s in crime,
I did that to get away from Maugham.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Ah, okay.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey:</strong> So, I really, I was really bogged down, I was
doing the documentary and I just thought no one’s interested in him, nobody
wants to know about him anymore. I’m running around like doing talks about
him everywhere. So what? And academics like it because they’re not really
looking at him, but they kind of like having some relevance to him.</p>
<p>So when I started doing the crime writing, I just thought, you know what
I really like? I like the genre. I really love true crime podcasts. I love
Truman Capote’s <em>In Cold Blood</em>. I think it’s one of the best things
ever written. And I just thought, you know, I’ll go down here and I’ll
see. You never know, right?</p>
<p>It’s commercially successful compared to anything else. Let’s try and
make some money for once. You know, instead of like, slaving away.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Okay, yes, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>And so, when I started doing the crime writing,
I loved it. So inspired. As you can see, <em>Someone Is Coming</em>. I’ve
written another one too that I’m still working on, and I just want to do
something completely different. Of course, the first time we get to do
an essay, we had to pick a subject to write an essay for. And I pick...</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>You pick Maugham.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>I do. And I’m like, can some of his <em>Far Eastern Tales</em> be
considered crime fiction?</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Right.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>Which they can. I argued that. Oh my God, though.
But I don’t know what it is. It’s like something won’t let me go. I don’t
know. Yeah, but it’s an obsession, but then, you know, we kind of fall
out of favour with each other, I feel sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>What I love about crime fiction is understanding
motives.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Right? So the how is not so interesting. It’s
really the why’s that are very interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>I mean, crime writing is huge, right? There’s
so many different genres within the genre. And so, like you have the whodunits,
the puzzle books.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>That’s always fun.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>Yeah, the thrillers. You know, the psychological,
thriller, <em>Silence of the Lambs</em> kind of, you know, stuff. But then
you have the Golden Age, Agatha Christie, Sherlock Holmes. I mean, there’s
so much there. But that’s what’s amazing about it. The new things that
are coming through, AI crime fiction.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>There’s AI crime fiction?</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>Yeah, you could ask AI. How can we commit a
crime? Climate crime is also coming through.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Climate crime? Oh, wow.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>About the crimes we do to the environment.
But I think crime writing is so fun and it’s so huge and it’s probably
the only genre where you can actually just do anything. Romance is probably
similar, right? You can set romance anywhere in the world. Yes. And it’s
the same with crime, but I do like, I’m also really into why. I mean, I
listen to a lot of true crime podcasts. I listen to a lot of cold cases.
I love a good cold case.</p>
<p>I’m also trying to figure out like why people, you know, disappear and
what goes on. And I love all that. Because I’m like, why? What happened
there? Or what did they miss? And especially, what’s so great to live in
this particular time is that, like, we do have the ability to look back
on old cases with a fresh pair of eyes and beyond even the DNA, right?
And beyond the scientific stuff, we get to figure out, like, what was society
saying back then? What did we miss, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>I have an important question. Do the Menendez
brothers deserve to be in jail?</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>That’s exactly what I was thinking about when
I was doing this. Personally, no, I don’t think they really, I don’t think
they really belong in jail. Not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>I feel like they’ve paid their dues. I do feel
like they did deserve to go to jail. They did shoot their parents.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>There’s no question, right? They killed their
parents. It’s just, you know.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>Yeah. I don’t know. What do you think, Jimmy?
You think they should be let out, though?</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>When you watch these documentaries, you feel
a lot of sympathy for them, right? But then the question is, how much credence
do you give to the accounts of abuse? And, you know, were they abused?
And you don’t want to, in the MeToo or post-MeToo period, you know, necessarily
cast doubts on that, but at the same time, just because they say it happened,
doesn’t mean necessarily it did happen.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>No, exactly. I totally agree with you. I didn’t
know enough about the case. Obviously, I was younger. I knew more about
OJ [Simpson], but I think that’s just the way the media was interpreted
back in Europe back then. But I will say that I was kind of shocked [that]
sexual abuse for young boys was not really considered.</p>
<p>Nobody ever thought about that back then when it’s been going on since
the Greeks. I mean, it’s on the vases, the pottery and the Romans. So I
found that was really strange. But then I don’t know many children that
were, people were being abused in the 1980s and ’70s, and people didn’t
report it, right? Obviously, I just feel like they seem to be good citizens
in prison. You know, they’re always helping out everybody.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Right. Yeah, I’m torn.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>Yeah, no, I understand. I’m also kind of annoyed
that this has taken so long for us to have this conversation about them.
I’m just kind of like, why haven’t we had this before? And that’s the TikTok
generation, apparently, that is bringing this all out, you know.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>And true crime podcasts and all that. They’re
just, you know, looking into cold cases and making it, bringing it to light.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>Yeah, there’s really good ones. <em>Up and Vanished</em> in
the States is probably my favourite.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Oh, I’ve not heard that one.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>It’s incredibly powerful and wonderful. But
America’s so good at that. They’re so good at podcasts.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>I think that’s because there’s a lot of crime
there.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>I know. And people go missing.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>I know, right?</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>But I do get fatigue.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Do you?</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>I do. From crime. I do get fatigue. Actually,
during our masters, we were offered therapy and counselling, if we ever
needed it, because we do get, when you are looking at, you have to explain
that you could be triggered, it can really get to you. I mean, I can feel
sometimes when I’ve reached a certain level of watching documentaries.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Yeah, it’s terrible, right? The things that
people are capable of.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>It’s a lot. No, it is. And there’s certain
things where I can’t watch. Jeffrey Dahmer, the one, the new one, I can’t.
And I’m really good. Like, I’m pretty good with really dark stuff, but
that was the one thing that I really couldn’t. I tried to, but I couldn’t
go there. No, because you have to realise that’s somebody’s tragedy. You
know, for entertainment purposes. It’s actually really messed up.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>Over eight hours or something.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>I know, of your life that you’re sitting there
watching the documentary thinking, what am I doing with my life here? You
know, how’s this really aiding me in my mental health?</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy<br></strong>No, it’s definitely not aiding in my mental
health.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey<br></strong>No.</p>
