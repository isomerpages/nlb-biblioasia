#### **Episode summary** ####
Khir Johari, food historian and award-winning author of _The_ _Food of Singapore Malays_ (2021), makes _mee maidin_ – a noodle dish based on a krill ragù – and tells us more about its origins. Why does a 1986 cookbook call it “mee mahdin”? And how was krill, once abundant in Singapore’s waters, caught using traditional fishing methods?

#### **Recipes**

Khir learnt how to make _mee maidin_ from Nordin (whom he called Wak Din), a man who used to sell the dish commercially at 34 Bussorah Street, formerly known as Kampong Kaji, in Kampong Glam.

According Khir’s research, Nordin inherited the recipe from Hussein, a migrant from South India who created the dish when he settled in Kampong Glam. Hajjah Asfiah Haji Abdullah, who wrote the 1986 cookbook, _Hidangan Warisan Kita_ (_Our Heritage Dishes_), featured the recipe in her book and named the dish “Mee Mahdin” – likely in honour of Nordin and his wife, Salmah.

##### Hajjah Asfiah’s ingredients and instructions<br>
600 g yellow noodles, dipped and tossed<br>
300 g bean sprouts, roots removed, dipped and tossed<br>
5 red peppers, sliced<br>
5 green peppers, sliced<br>
250 g lettuce leaves, sliced<br>
3 pieces of tofu, half-fried and cut into small pieces<br>
5 chicken eggs, boiled and quartered<br>
2 tablespoons wheat flour<br>
1/4 grated coconut, squeeze 300 ml of coconut milk<br>
600 ml cold water<br>
salt to taste<br>

<b>Ingredients (A)</b>:<br>
(finely ground, separate)<br>
5 red pepper seeds<br>
5 green peppercorns<br>
300 g wet geragau prawns<br>
¼ grated coconut with the skin removed<br>

<b>Ingredients (B)</b>:<br>
(finely sliced ​​and deep fried)<br>
12 red onions<br>
6 garlic cloves<br>

1. Mix ingredients A in a saucepan. Add 600 ml of cold water and salt to taste. Stir evenly. Heat over slow fire. Then add wheat flour and coconut milk, stir again and let it boil.

2. To serve, put some mee and bean sprouts in a bowl. Pour in the sauce. Place the salad leaves, tofu, red pepper, fried onions, green pepper and eggs on top.

##### Khir’s recipe<br>
30 shallot cloves<br>
3-4 tbsp. salt (for brining)<br>
3 cups cooking oil<br>
2 kg krill<br>
1 cup water (for boiling the krill)<br>
20 stalks dried chilli<br>
12 garlic cloves (approx. 95 g)<br>
400 g coconut cream sans emulsifier<br>
2 tbsp. flat sugar<br>
1 tbsp. salt or to taste<br>
1 tbsp. flat cornstarch<br>
1 kg yellow noodles<br>

<b>For the garnish</b>:<br>
1 head lettuce, sliced<br>
200 g bean sprouts<br>
fried firm tofu<br>
green and red chillies, deseeded and sliced<br>
hard boiled eggs<br>
calamansi<br>
soy sauce<br>

1. Slice the shallots into thin, uniform slices. Brine for 10–15 minutes to draw out excess moisture, then remove, rinse well and pat dry.

2. Heat the cooking oil over low to medium heat, then fry the sliced shallots until lightly golden. Remove from oil and pat with a paper towel to remove excess oil. The shallots will continue to brown slightly due to carryover cooking. 1/3 of the fried shallots will be used as garnish and the rest will be for the ragù. Keep the shallot oil for the ragù.

3. Using a colander, wash and clean the krill.

4. Bring 1 cup of water to a boil in a medium size pot. Add in the krill.

5. Coarse grind the cooked krill (with ½ cup water if stuck).

6. To prepare the chilli paste, first cut the dried chillies and remove the seeds. Then boil the chillies to soften them. Blend the softened chillies into a paste. Add the garlic to create the _rempah_ (add a little water if it’s too chunky).

7. Sauté the _rempah_ in the shallot oil until the _rempah_ is slightly darker and the oil separates, about 12 minutes.

8. Add in the ground krill.

9. Stir in the coconut cream.

10. Give the ragù a touch of sweetness with sugar. Test for saltiness.

11. Add a little water to the corn starch to create a paste, then blend it in with the ragù.

12. Add the crushed fried shallots.

13. Assemble and serve with yellow noodles and garnishes.

From forests to coastlines, the Malay community has foraged for food for centuries. Khir Johari examines this way of life before land reclamation, when food was largely seasonal and indigenous communities had intimate knowledge of their natural world.

Kampong Glam (originally spelt “Campong Gelam” when it was named around 1830) is one of 10 subzones of the Rochor area located in the central region. The road names in Kampong Glam such as Bussorah, Muscat and Kandahar streets – named after places in the Muslim world – were approved by the municipal commissioners at a meeting held on 15 April 1910. On 7 July 1989, Kampong Glam was gazetted as a conservation area, and it is preserved as a historic part of town.

_Belacan_ is a condiment made of _geragau_ (krill) that has been salted, dried and fermented, and is an essential ingredient in Peranakan and Malay cuisine. It is usually mixed with chili, lime, salt and sugar to create _sambal belacan_, a must-have chili condiment accompanying meals eaten in many Peranakan, Malay and Eurasian households in Singapore and Malaysia.

_Belacan. Terasi. Kapi. Bagoong_. These are some of the names that refer to shrimp paste in Southeast Asia. Although early Europeans to the region were repulsed by it, the locals swear that the condiment gives a kick to any dish.
