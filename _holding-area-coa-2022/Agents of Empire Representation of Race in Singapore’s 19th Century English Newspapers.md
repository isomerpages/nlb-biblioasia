#### **Introduction**

Singapore’s first newspaper, the  <i> Singapore Chronicle </i> , was published a mere five years after Stamford Raffles stepped ashore in 1819.1 Soon, the printed word took such a hold of the public mind that busy merchants in Commercial Square (now Raffles Place) were spending a half hour daily discussing the news, including commodity prices and the arrival and departure of cargo-laden ships.2

A plethora of newspapers were launched during the 19th century, though most sank rather quickly. Some, like the <i>Singapore Free Press</i>, survived well into the 20th century, while the <i>Straits Times</i> is in circulation to this day. Virtually all newspapers then perpetuated ideas of race, civilisation, progress and development that subordinated the native and immigrant populations to white colonisers. This essay will show how they did so, by drawing examples from local English-language newspapers across a quarter of a century – from 1875, when Singapore was still a young Crown Colony following its administrative reconstitution into the Straits Settlements, to
the close of the century. The newspapers propped up the imperial edifice,
alongside weapons, books, art and other modes of knowledge production
that have been so extensively studied by scholars of postcolonialism.


#### **The Sociopolitical Context – Global and Local**
By the mid-19th century, the tentacles of British imperialism had reached
into the farthest expanses of Asia and Africa through coercion, deception
and collaboration with local elites. The brutal suppression of the 1857 revolt
in India had been followed by the passing of power into the hands of the
Crown under Queen Victoria. The 258-year-old East India Company was
out, and the Age of Empire officially dawned. This puzzled the British. How
could an island of 17 million establish sovereignty over territories thousands
of miles away and many times greater in size and population? The English
historian John Robert Seeley captured this sense of disbelief, writing in 1883:
“We seem, as it were, to have conquered and peopled half the world in a fit
of absence of mind.”3
There was no dearth of (pseudo) scientific theories to explain the
impossible. Most of these coalesced under social Darwinism. Seizing upon
Darwin’s 1838 theory of biological evolution, academics like Herbert Spencer
quickly concocted its social counterpart, i.e., survival among individuals
competing for limited resources. And given that Europeans in general and
the English in particular were winning the competition, the academics
concluded that the European civilisation was the apex of human evolution,
with others – Hindu, Islamic, Chinese, African, Malay – competing for a
distant second place.4

Singapore had its fair share of colonial administrators who subscribed
to these ideas. Raffles himself, until so recently considered a progressive
administrator, believed in a metaphorical racial ladder, the highest rungs of
which were occupied by Europeans, followed by those natives who adopted
Western modes of behaviour, lifestyle and clothing.5
