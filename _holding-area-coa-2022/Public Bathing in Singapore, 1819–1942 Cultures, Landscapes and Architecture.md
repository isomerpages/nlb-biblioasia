#### **Introduction**

With 26 public pools across the city, complemented by pools of private clubs and residences, Singapore residents today have no shortage of access to water for recreation and sport. This wider access to swimming is often traced back to the opening of Mount Emily Pool in 1931, placing Singapore’s history of leisure swimming as a phenomenon of the 20th century.2 The first municipally owned site for swimming, Mount Emily Pool arguably represents the point when swimming became truly public. It was part of a
wider programme of the Municipal Commissioners, who were beginning to
see public recreation as part of their remit, thus representing an important
transition from older laissez-faire models to a modern one of government
provision.3 However, the attention given to Mount Emily Pool, which
highlights public swimming, also masks a longer history of popular
swimming in Singapore that extends to the early 19th century.

Although swimming environments prior to Mount Emily Pool were
not public in the current sense, there have nonetheless been places for
popular swimming in Singapore since at least the 1820s, more than 100
years before the opening of Mount Emily Pool. My aim here is to extend
the accepted timeframe of public swimming by sketching an initial history
of the wider social and physical environments of swimming in colonial
Singapore. It begins with the origins of British colonialism and ends with
the Japanese Occupation.

Several histories have addressed swimming in Singapore, but none cover
this extended period. Ying-Kit Chan wrote a significant study of swimming
in relation to Singapore’s politics, though focused on a postcolonial setting.4
Jocelyn Lau and Lucien Low recorded the popular memory of a large
collection of pools, and other detailed histories have been written about
individual swimming clubs.5 Most often, references to the local history
of swimming are minor parts of wider sports histories, including those of
writers such as Nick Aplin and Peter Horton, who reasonably focus more on
the development of athletic sporting pursuits.6

My intention, however, is to document a wider view of swimming, not
just as sport or exercise, but as a series of interconnected social practices
based around designated swimming sites. To piece together this history, I
worked with various primary sources at the National Library and National
Archives of Singapore, combining passing details from newspapers, maps,
reports, photographs, travel memoirs and other materials, to build an initial
picture of the development of popular swimming practices and locations
across the 19th and early 20th centuries. These record the environments of
early swimming, and the debates surrounding them.

Based on the period of British colonialism in Singapore, this history is
very much about how British administrative views shaped local ideas on
swimming and bathing. It is about how a new geography of bathing was
established within the colony through definitions and limitations of water
use. As such, I do not discuss the bathing practices that originated from
Singapore’s precolonial settlements. The chosen time period traverses the
introduction of Singapore’s public water system, addresses how Victorian
morality met colonial racism, and considers how bathing transformed from
personal respite to communal leisure, and then to sporting exercise.

#### **19th-Century Swimming**

Various types of aquatic leisure environments have been available and
popular in Singapore since the early period of British settlement. These have
included *pagar* (fenced sea enclosures), bathing piers and swimming tanks,
which are the predecessors of today’s Olympic-standard pools. However, it
is not always straightforward to bring these examples together and suggest
them as sources of contemporary swimming approaches.

The problem in extending histories of swimming to the 19th century lies
in historical language, and the common practices and understandings then.
What we today recognise as “swimming” – an athletic activity with fixed
strokes and distances – did not exist for most of the 19th century. As Nick
Aplin indicates, 19th-century swimming was more a social activity, which
although allowing for community games, was not really a sport yet.7 The
term “swimming” in its present sense was not even applicable then. Based on its use in 19th-century newspapers, people in Singapore only “swam”
when fleeing sinking ships or escaping pirates.8 The word was not applied to
a leisurely dip in the water, instead suggesting emergency crossings of water,
which were certainly not perceived as recreational. Leisurely forms of going
into the water were understood as “bathing”.

The use of the word “bathing” does raise complications, particularly
for its association with hygienic forms of washing, which are very distinct
from what we now consider “swimming”. However, these two approaches to
entering the water share common historical roots that combine leisure and
cleansing, and are described in several histories of bathing, including the
classic work of architecture historian Sigfried Giedion.9 In the 19th century,
swimming and washing were still largely unified activities; people bathed
for many reasons: exercise, recreation, socialising, hygiene and sometimes
even games or competition. Water-based competitions were launched at the
New Year Sports Day and events such as the opening of the New Harbour
(Keppel Bay), and public lectures and the popular press gave advice about
the general health benefits of sea swimming, as well as warnings of the
dangers of bathing as exercise.10

This distinction of historical language is useful, as it helps to map a
series of interconnected activities that sets the scope of this initial history.
Based on this language, my approach has been to incorporate the period’s
wider sense of “bathing”. Therefore, I combine recreational swimming,
public washing, socialising in the water, and the gradual emergence of
water-based athletics, considering the design of the physical locations that
allowed these varied activities to take place. My intention is to make sense
of how water access was mapped onto Singapore’s landscape within the
British colonial system. Essentially, this is to consider how people could
access water, what kinds of structures provided this access, and how water
bodies were classified for public use. Official efforts to define public bathing
resulted in special designations of urban water bodies, mapping the town’s water according to allowable practices within the colonial system. It was
through these designations that modern ideas of water use emerged, leading
to new definitions of swimming and its separation from washing and
domestic bathing.
