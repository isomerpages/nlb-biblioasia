#### **Introduction**
From its founding in 1819, modern Singapore has been a multiracial and
multilingual society. The earliest materials printed in Singapore were in
languages such as English, Siamese, Malay, Arabic and Chinese. This
study focuses on early printing in the Chinese language, Singapore’s role
in this development and the impact it made on the Chinese language and
Chinese communities.

This essay starts with a survey of what was published during the 19th
century, followed by a review of what has been studied so far. Based on
these, I examine the changing role of Singapore as a society that enabled
early printing in the Chinese language to take shape, and how this early
availability of printing in the Chinese language impacted the multiracial
and multicultural society.


#### **What Was Published: Output From Early Printing in the Chinese Language**
Due to historical and environmental factors, Singapore’s early efforts
in Chinese-language printing were not well preserved. Despite the
introduction of *The Book Registration Ordinance*, 1886, the situation did not improve, as observed by Cecil Byrd in 1970 when he visited Singapore.
He conducted a survey of early printing in the Straits Settlements, which
was a preliminary exploration of the nascent print industries in the
three settlements.1 Since then, a lot of effort – by local and international
academics, librarians and curators – has been put into compiling a set
of documentation. They have worked to source for samples, including
unrecorded extant titles, so that we now have a better picture of the total
output of such prints.

This study will attempt to compile a list of known titles held by libraries
and archives, listed in special bibliographies and catalogues, as well as
cited by researchers in their dissertations, theses, papers and articles. The
listing will also be supplemented by searching the Online Public Access
Catalogues (OPA C) of the National Library Board (NL B), National
University of Singapore Libraries (NUS Libraries), British Library (BL)
and other libraries specialising in East and Southeast Asian studies.
The resultant listings have been appended as: *Appendix I: A chronology of
printing in the Chinese language, 1825–1902; and Appendix II: A chronology
of printing in romanised Malay and English produced by Straits Chinese,
1889–1902*.

A total of 143 uniform titles were identified as samples of early printing in
the Chinese language, as well as those in romanised Malay and English
produced by the Straits Chinese during the period from 1825 to 1902. The
inclusion of the latter category of printing is due to the fact that they were
works translated from Chinese classics, or written by Chinese and printed or
published by the Chinese press. Together, these constitute the documentary
heritage of the Chinese community in Singapore.

#### **What Has Been Studied: Literature Review**
Studies of early printing efforts in Singapore in the Chinese language
started with Chinese newspapers that emerged only in the second half of
the 19th century. As early as 1927, China-based journalist Ge Gongzhen (戈公振) mentioned in his three-volume work *History of Chinese Newspaper
Press* (《中国报学史》) that the significance of publications such as Malacca’s
first Chinese periodical, *Chinese Monthly Magazine* (《察世俗每月统记传》), and
Singapore’s first Chinese-language magazine, *East-West Magazine* (《东西洋考每
月统记传》), was their contributions to the development of the modern Chinese
press in China.2

Ge also made a special trip to London to read the two magazines and
subsequently wrote an article about them.3 His initial attempt to chronicle
Chinese-language printing may have prompted the first academic study
of early Chinese newspapers by Singaporean Chen Mong Hock. Her MA
thesis, *The Early Chinese Newspapers of Singapore*, 1881–1912 (Singapore:
University of Malayan Press, 1967), remains one of the most authoritative
studies on this subject to this day. Following Chen, a few local and foreign
academics, including He Shumin (何舒敏, 1977),4 David Chng (莊钦永, 1982),5
Wong Hong Ting (王慷鼎, 1982),6 Wu Qing Tang (吴庆棠, 1997),7 and Zhuo
Nan Sheng (卓南生, 1998),8 also added new findings to these studies.

During the first half of the 19th century, the printing and publishing scene
in Singapore was very active. Soon after Sir Stamford Raffles had founded Singapore and established it as a modern and free entrepôt centre linking
Southeast Asia to the rest of the world, Protestant missionaries from the
London Missionary Society (LMS ) and American Board of Commissioners
Foreign Mission (ABCFM) made Singapore a printing centre for both
religious tracts and secular material during the same period. A significant
number of Chinese-language prints that made a great impact in the region,
as well as in China, were produced during this period.

However, as LMS and ABCFM were not based in Singapore, their archives
and library collections were not easily accessible for consultation, and the
study of the missionary press and their printing and publishing activities
during this period inevitably became difficult to achieve.

As such, it is unsurprising that the study of the missionary press and its
printing activities was not feasible until 1960, when ABCFM donated their
library materials to Harvard University, and their archives to the Houghton
Rare Book Library in the U.S.9 Since then, John King Fairbank, Susan
Barnett and the Harvard University group have embarked on a series of
studies into the Protestant missionaries’ legacy concerning the spread of
Christianity and their role in China’s modernisation.10 Cross-cultural
communications by the western Protestants and their Chinese respondents
subsequently became the main subject of study.

In 1985, the Harvard group published an inaugural selection of papers
from a conference held at Harvard University in August 1978. The volume,
entitled *Christianity in China: Early Protestant Missionary Writings*, explored
what the Protestant pioneers of the 19th century wrote in Chinese for their
target audiences.11

Following the precedence of ABCFM, LMS donated their archives and
collections to the School of Oriental & African Studies Library at the University of London in 1973.12 Studies, such as the one on the Anglo-
Chinese College of Malacca by Brian Harrison (1979),13 the London
Missionary Society by Leona O’Sullivan (1984),14 and *The Printing Presses of
the London Missionary Society Among the Chinese* by Ching Su (1996), as well
as a series of books on LMS and early printing in Malacca, Singapore and in
China were made possible by this donation.15

In China, studies on early printing in the Chinese language focused
mostly on the missionary-driven Chinese press, the two early Chinese
magazines (Malacca’s first Chinese periodical *Chinese Monthly Magazine*
and Singapore’s first Chinese-language magazine *East-West Magazine*)
and cross-cultural communication between East and West. These studies
were conducted by two important groups: one at Zhejiang University, led
by Huang Shijian (黄时鉴), and another at Fudan University, led by Zhou
Zhen He (周振鹤) and Zou Zhen Huan (邹振环).16 They published a series of
reprints of primary sources, research articles and monographs featuring the
topics mentioned earlier.

In 2006, David Chng completed his PhD dissertation and presented a
comprehensive study on Chinese printing and publishing by LMS and
ABCFM in the first half of the 19th century in Malacca and Singapore.
His work was inspired by the pioneer Protestants who had been stationed
in Southeast Asia and China in the years before the First Opium War
(1839–1842). The coverage of topics such as the political conflict between
the Qing and British governments that led the two missionary societies
to set up Chinese printing presses in the Malayan peninsula, as well
as the workings of both presses (financial sources, printing processes,
number of titles published, print runs, etc.) gave context to the origins of
the publications.

Chng’s thesis also examined the distribution network of publications,
with an in-depth analysis of the impact these publications had on the
Chinese scholars who read them. His thesis also examined the linguistic
contributions of the missionaries to the modern Chinese lexicon, and the
significance of these publications in the history of thought in modern
China. As such, Chng’s work covers almost all the important findings by
earlier researchers in this field (as of 2006) and provides more concrete
source evidence to prove his points.

Besides his dissertation, Chng also published a series of papers on
missionary novels in the Chinese language,17 a relatively new discipline of
study (started by Patrick Hanan (2000)18 of Harvard University) in relation
to early Protestant missionary writing.

Chen Song-Chuan, formerly an assistant professor of history at Nanyang
Technological University, Singapore, recently produced a study exploring
the efforts and impact of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge
in China (SDK , 1834–1839), the publisher for the majority of secular material
printed by the American Mission Press based in Singapore in the five years
before the First Opium War.

In summary, there has been a lot of focus on early printing in the Chinese
language in Singapore in the first half of the 19th century, but works
published in the second half of the century, besides Chinese newspapers,
have, for the most part, been neglected. Studies have been largely limited
to Protestant missionary works before the First Opium War, and none
paid sufficient attention to the role of Singapore in this publication legacy.
Moreover, many of their studies do not include printing activities after the
decline of missionary presses in Singapore.

While Ching and Chng’s dissertations both acknowledge the role of
Singapore in the early printings by the Protestants before the First Opium
War, the scopes of their studies do not go beyond that of the Protestants’
works – Chen focused his attention on the “information war” waged by the
SDK based in Guangzhou, and did not take Singapore’s supporting role in the “war” into serious consideration. Hence, there is a need to go beyond
existing research and examine the changing role of Singapore as a place of
Chinese publications during the entire 19th century.


#### **Singapore as a Centre of Printing and Publishing of Chinese Materials Outside China (1825–1846)**

Failing to establish a missionary enterprise among the Chinese in
Guangdong, Robert Morrison (1782–1834) of the LMS turned his attention
to Southeast Asia while waiting for an opportune time to return to a more
open and welcoming China. Between 1815 and 1819, LMS established
missions in Malacca, Penang, Batavia and Singapore.19 In 1815, William
Milne founded the Malaccan mission and started printing *Chinese Monthly Magazine*, the first Chinese magazine published outside of China, which
had a great impact on the emergence of modern Chinese magazines in
mainland China.20

Between 1819 and 1822, LMS shifted part of its printing resources to
Singapore.21 On 23 January 1823 Claudius Henry Thomsen set up a printing
press to print English and Malay documents, as well as bind books. Samuel
Milton, also from LMS , made an unauthorised acquisition trip to Calcutta,
India on 8 December 1822 and returned with three printing presses that
enabled the Mission Press to print in five languages: English, Siamese,
Malay, Arabic and Chinese.22

The Press operated from the Singapore Institute for a few years with Milton
in charge, followed by Thomsen. Publications produced between 1825
and 1826 were published under Institution Press or Mission Press. In 1825,
the Press began to print religious tracts in the Chinese language. From
then on, Singapore overtook Malacca as LMS ’ printing and publishing
centre in Southeast Asia. Blocks for the reprint of Milne and Walter
Henry Medhurst’s religious tracts in Chinese were engraved and printed in Singapore. The Press also published the first Chinese textbook, *Xunnu
Sanzijing* (《训女三字经》), in 1832.23

The ABCFM also undertook a special task to start the mass printing
of a Chinese publication for the SDK , which was established by some
foreign merchants and Protestant pioneers based in Guangzhou.24

From 1815 to 1845, the Singapore mission presses (LMS and ABCFM)
produced a total of 102 Chinese titles comprising religious pamphlets, as
well as secular materials written in Chinese by Protestant missionaries and
their assistants.25 Most of the publications were first printed, or reprinted,
in Singapore. About half a million volumes were estimated to have been
printed in Singapore,26 significantly more than those printed in Malacca,
Batavia, Penang and Serampore.

As a printing and publishing centre, LMS and ABCFM also developed a
distribution network in Singapore. While in Malacca, Milne had established
a distribution network through ships’ captains, as well as masters of junks
and boats, with books reportedly reaching America, St. Helena, Bombay,
Madras, Bengal, Burma, Tibet, China, Irkutsk, Japan, Cochin China, Siam,
Kedah, Penang, the islands in the Malacca Straits, Bencoolen, Padang,
Bangka, Borneo, the Moluccas, the Celebes, Java and Manila.27

Milne’s successor followed the same modus operandi, but increasingly
turned to ship captains and crew in Singapore. In addition, thousands of
copies of the New Testament and religious tracts were distributed by Karl Gützlaff, Medhurst and Jacob Tomlin on their travels,28 and by all willing
callers at the missions. American missionaries followed the same distribution
pattern as the English, but with one innovation – they chartered a ship for
wider literature dissemination rather than passively depending on ships
visiting the harbour.29

#### **Singapore’s Supporting Role in the “Information War” on China (1834–1834)**
One of the outcomes of early Singapore imprints in the Chinese language
reaching the Chinese in mainland China and Southeast Asia was the
introduction of modern science and technology to the Chinese-speaking
world. As early as 1833, when Gützlaff established the *East-West Magazine*
in Guangzhou, his intention was to fill the Chinese magazine with “useful
knowledge and science”. A year later he advocated the establishment of
SDK and placed the Chinese magazine under its auspices. The magazine
was subsequently printed in Singapore, as were the other titles published
by the Society.30 Gützlaff defined scientific knowledge broadly to include
history, geography and economics, subjects he frequently covered.31

Active in the five years before the First Opium War, SDK represented a
third form of British engagement with the Chinese, besides the diplomatic
attempts of 1793 and 1816, and the First Opium War. The SDK waged
an “information war” to penetrate the information barrier that the Qing
government had established to contain European trade and missions.32

In the early 1830s, foreign missionaries and merchants in Guangzhou
believed that restrictions placed on Westerners were due to inadequate and
insufficient knowledge of the West. Thus, they convened in November
1834 and decided to engage in “warfare” that involved the publication of
books in Chinese.33 Through the publication and distribution of these
books, they hoped to give the Chinese access to information barred by the
Qing government and believed this would enable them to understand the
true character of the Europeans and be open to trade and proselytising.34

Between 1834 and 1840, SDK reprinted or published one magazine and six
Chinese books in Singapore, including *East-West Magazine* (1834–1839);
A History of England (《大英国统志》 by Gützlaff, 1834); *A General History of
the World* (《古今万国纲鉴》 by Gützlaff, 1838); *A Short Account of the United
Provinces of America* (《美理哥合省国志略》 by E.J. Bridgman, 1838); *Aesop’s
Fables* (《意拾秘传》 by Robert Thom, 1838–1839), *Outline of Old Testament
History* (《古时如氐亚国历代列传》 by Robert Morrison, 1838) and *A Treatise
on Political Economy* (《贸易通志》 by Gützflaff, 1840). The treatises on
history and geography were prioritised and hence were among the earliest
books published.35

The impact of SDK ’s publications was felt during the First Opium War
in mainland China. After the British defeated the Qing Empire, scholars
such as Wei Yuan (魏源, 1794–1856), Xu Jiyu (徐继畬, 1795–1873) and Liang
Tingnan (梁廷枬, 1796–1861) witnessed, or became concerned with, the
power of the maritime nations of the West and stepped up efforts to
understand these foreigners. When these scholar-officials sought to gather
materials to write treatises on the new maritime nations, the Singapore
imprints were able to meet this need.36

Wei Yuan’s work, *Illustrated Treatise on Maritime Countries* (《海国图志》),
was first published in 1842 in 50 *juan* (chapters); revised and expanded
editions were published in 60 *juan* in 1847 and 100 juan in 1852, with more
materials in Chinese. Researchers have pointed out that *Illustrated Treatise on Maritime Countries* resembles an organised scrapbook with materials
from different books (with minor changes) cut-and-pasted into it, sorted by
continents and sub-categorised by nations.

Information related to the Society and the geo-history of the maritime
countries that was “borrowed” from the Singapore imprints include 12 from
the *East-West Magazine*,37 14 from *General Account of Trade* (《贸易通志》)38
and 42 from Bridgman’s *A Short Account of the United Provinces of America*.39
*The Illustrated Treatise on Maritime Countries*, in turn, became one of the
most important reference books on the subject of global geo-history in
the second half of the 19th century. In China, the scholar-officials of the
Qing Empire used this resource when they were forced to learn more about
the new world power struggles between the maritime empires. In Japan,
*Illustrated Treatise on Maritime Countries* was widely circulated and made an
impact on the Japanese reform era.40

Xu Jiyu’s *A Brief Description of the Ocean Circuit* (《瀛寰志略》), published in
1848, along with *Illustrated Treatise on Maritime Countries*, influenced both
Qing China and Japan. To write the book, Xu studied materials collected in
Chinese and interviewed foreigners on the subjects of global geography and
world history.41

Liang Tingnan’s *Accounts on the United States* (《合省国说》, 1844) and
Accounts of London (《兰伦偶说》, 1845) also relied heavily on *A Short Account
of the United Provinces of America* and *East-West Magazine* respectively.42
Until at least the 1880s, these Chinese publications printed or published
in Singapore were the main resources for understanding the maritime
nations in the Qing Empire.43

#### **Singapore’s Linguistic Contribution to Modern Chinese Lexicology (1807–1843)**
In order to express certain Western ideas in their translated works, pioneer
missionaries had to coin new words that were later adopted by Chinese
scholars. These new words were the tools that allowed intellectuals to tap
into western knowledge and widen their perspective of the world.44 As a
substantial number of these new words were formed between 1807 and
1843, and were first used in publications published in Singapore, Singapore
therefore had a role in contributing to modern Chinese lexicology.

Pioneer missionaries generally employed two approaches in coming up with
new Chinese words or phrases. Firstly, they adopted an existing classical
Chinese term and gave it a new meaning, extended its original meaning
to add dimensions of meaning to it, or Christianised the original term.
Secondly, if they could not transform an old word or phrase, they would
then create new ones.45

During the 36 years of proselytisation through writing and translation
work, the pioneer missionaries created a great number of new Chinese
terms, which covered a wide range of subjects (such as religion, science and
technology, social science, culture, political science, history and geography)
that became rich cultural resources. Some terms were later replaced by
newer ones while many are still widely used today. The following terms are
some examples from the Singapore imprints and showcase their contribution
in the development of modern Chinese lexicology:46

|Chinese term|Meaning & First Appearance|Reference|
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
|犹太教|Judaism: derived from the Greek “Ioudaios” and first used in the New Testament of the Bible in the Epistle of Galatians《救世主耶稣新遗诏书. 圣差保罗寄伽拉太人书》(新加坡，新加坡坚夏书院, 1840; Chap 1, para 13, p.1, lower portion)|Chng 2010:5|
|蒸船| Steamboat: first used by Gützlaff in *Correction of Erroneous Impression*《是非略论》(新加坡坚夏书院, 1835). The term has now been replaced by 轮船.|Chng 2010:5|
|火车|Train: first used by 裨治文 in *A Short Account of the United Provinces of America* (新加坡：坚夏书院，1838; v.1, p. 19, lower portion)|Chng 2010:7–8|
|医学院|Medical college/school: first used in *East-West Magazine*, 道光丁酉年 (1837年) 四月，页2下 (221).| Chng 2010:9
|凸字书|Braille: first used in *A Short Account of the United Provinces of America* 帙2，卷之二十四，页61下，“教之盲者即有凸字书，使他以手揣摩而读”|Chng 2010:9|
|文凭 | Diploma: Bridgman used the existing term from《 水浒全传》to refer to “diploma” in English in *A Short Account of the United Provinces of America* 序，帙1，页2上. | Chng 2010:10 |
| 博物院 | Museum: first used by Bridgman in *A Short Account of the United Provinces of America* (帙一，卷之首，页25上). It is still used as an alternative to 博物馆. | Chng 2010:10 |
| 统领, 正统领, 副领, 副统领 | 统领 and 正统领 refer to the president of the United States; while 副领 and 副统领 refer to its vice-president. These terms were created by Bridgman in *A Short Account of the United Provinces of America* and widely used in China in the 19th century before they were replaced by 总统 and 副总统 in the 20th century. | Chng 2010:13 | 
| 国旗 | National flag: first used by Bridgman in *A Short Account of the United Provinces of America* to refer to the national flag of the U.S.| Chng 2010:14 |
| 国父 | “Father of His Country”: first used by Bridgman in *A Short Account of the United Provinces of America* to refer to George Washington, the “Father of USA”. | Chng 2010:15 |
