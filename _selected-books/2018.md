Inspired by the National Library Singapore’s exhibition of the same name that was launched in 2017, *Tales of the Malay World* features more than 60 rare early manuscripts and lithographed books from centuries past, at a time when Malay was the dominant language of trade, diplomacy, religious discourse and literature in maritime Southeast Asia.

This volume presents nearly 400 advertisements – from the 1830s to 1960s – from the collection of the National Library, Singapore. They are selected from a variety of print materials, including newspapers, books, periodicals and ephemera. Written by our own librarians and curators, the eight chapters in this book provide an overview of print advertisements for a range of goods or services: automobiles, entertainment, fashion, food, hospitality, household goods, medical and travel. Beyond offering a glimpse into the material world of a particular period, advertisements may also reveal certain cultural conditions of the day, such as racial prejudices and gender stereotypes.

*Shifting Currents: Glimpses of a Changing Nation* is the first book to present a significant collection of Kouo Shang-Wei's most arresting images from his lifetime of photography. Kouo Shang-Wei (1924–88) was particularly attuned to the passing of time. Over several decades spanning the 1950s to the late 1980s, Kouo's keen eye captured thousands of images of a rapidly changing Singapore, with his viewfinder most often focusing on the evolution of the Singapore River and its environs. His photographs today provide us with a precious record of that period and the price of modernisation. The images in this book were carefully curated from the Kouo Shang-Wei Collection in the National Library, Singapore, by art historian Zhuang Wubin.
