As recently as the end of the 19th century, magic and superstition were a regular part of daily life among the Malays in the region. As the cultural changes brought about by European colonialism were not yet widespread, the traditional beliefs 
and practices of the Malays were left largely intact.

This aspect of Malay life is documented in the book, *Malay Magic: Being an Introduction to the Folklore and Popular Religion of the Malay Peninsula*, by the Englishman Walter William Skeat. When it was first published, *Malay Magic* was considered a pioneering work on Malay beliefs and practices relating to age-old superstition and magic.1

One of the book’s key merits – and the reason why it is regarded as a classic – is Skeat’s meticulous description of the subject matter, which later allowed other ethnographers to compare it with similar beliefs in other cultures.2
Previous ethnography studies lacked a sound grounding in factual information – what was available was mostly from the casual observations and writings of travellers, missionaries and administrators. His aim was not to interpret the information, but to record a traditional way of life that was in danger of disappearing, or being altered beyond recognition.3 Skeat’s work lay the foundations for future research, especially in the field of Malay and indigenous Orang Asli ethnography. At least two notable publications – *John Grim lette’s Malay Poisons and Charm Cures and Kirk Endicott’s An Analysis of Malay Magic* – are evidence of this.4

Skeat’s methodology of systematic data collection, rather than theorising or explaining social behaviours, could have been influenced by his stint at Christ’s College, Cambridge. A. C. Haddon – a former student at the college – first advocated such methodical fieldwork; Robertson Smith, another Christ’s College fellow, 
argued that the collection of data was 
more important than mere theory, a belief 
also held by Skeat.5
The first 50 pages of Skeat’s book 
discuss the Malays’ native cosmogony, 
anthropogony, animism and notions about 
souls. The next 50 pages or so discuss 
the world of spirits, the Malay pantheon 
and its relation to the human world, as 
well as the men who act as go-betweens 
between the two realms.
The rest of the book details Malay 
beliefs and practices relating to fire, air, 
earth and water, and the relationship 
between the life of man and the spiritual 
world. It also includes descriptions of 
paraphernalia, the recital of formulae, 
prayers, sacrifices, lustrations, fasting, 
divinations and witchcraft.6
The book contains illustrations Skeat 
had earlier presented to the Cambridge 
University Museum of Archaeology and 
Ethnology in 1897.7
 In addition, it contains 
an appendix of almost 100 pages, which 
largely record Malay oral texts.
In total, Malay Magic records some 
270 spells and charms. It has been 
reprinted several times, and the 2005 
reprint includes an appendix showing 
additional annotations by Skeat on two 
copies of the printed book over the half 
century following its first publication. One 
of the annotated copies of Malay Magic
is kept by a member of the Skeat family, 
while the other is at Oxford University.8
