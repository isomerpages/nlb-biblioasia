**Giving Your Past a Present - The Gift of Remembering**<br>

**Through His Eyes: Remembering old Singapore Through the Poems of Edwin Thumboo**<br>
Singapore's landscape is one that has undergone many changes through the ages, and has come a long way from rural *kampongs* and swaplands. In less than 50 years, the tiny red dot on the world map has traded in zinc roofs for concrete apartments and quiet shops for towering skyscrapers. As we struggle to keep pace with change, development and modernity, we also race to document, remember and hold onto what Singapore was – and by proxy, ourselves.

**MGS Memories of 11 Mount Sophia**<br>
Founded in 1887, the Methodist Girls' School (MGS) is among the oldest and most established schools in Singapore. Today, 125 years later, it is still regarded as one of Singapore's popular and premier girls' schools. MGS occupies 11 Mount Sophia from 1928 to 1992. As this site is slated for re-development, former students and staff of the school revisited the scene for one last look, to pay tribute to their alma mater in a ceremonial send-off. Barbara Quek, a former MGS student, shares with us the history of the school and memories that left a deep imprint on many who passed through its doors.

**Saya dan Bulan Bahasa**<br>
Saya diminta menulis tentang memori saya mengenai pelibatan saya dalam kegiatan dan perayaan Bulan Bahasa di Singapura. Sepanjang ingatan saya, dengan name Bulan Bahasa, kegiatan dan perayaan melestari dan menggunakan bahasa itu di Singapura telah dimulai semenjak tahun 1959. Hanya nama bahasa itu yang berubah-ubah sesuai dengan rasa, selesa dan kuasa yang selari dengan fenomena hidup di Singapura pada masa itu: 1959 – 1966 disebut bahasa Kebangsaan; 1966 – kini disebut bahasa Kedua; 1982 – kini disebut semula bahasa Melayu, atau bahasa ibunda. Dalam tulisan ini akan saya cuba sedapat-dapatnye menyatakan pengalaman dan keterlibatan saya dalam kegiatan dan perayaan bulan-bulan bahasa itu.

**In the Family: Family History Resources in the National Library**<br>
When tracing our family history, we embark on a meandering voyage to an unknown destination, each step often painfully slow because of the seemingly impossible mountain of resources to sift through or the dead-ends faced. However, the experience can be rewarding despite its challenges when guided with the right tools. The National Library has various resources to help the researcher complete the journey of discovering one's roots.

**NLB-Saudi Arabia Cultural Mission Collaboration**<br>
The Saudi Arabia Cultural Mission in Singapore was open in 2008 under the umbrella of the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia in Singapore to strengthen the friendly relations between Saudi Arabia and Singapore. Since its establishment, the Cultural Mission has organised more than 10 cultural visits between the two countries and supported numerous cultural and educational events by Singapore organisations. The Cultural Mission has also facilitated joint scientific research between the universities of both countries.

**iremembermagazines: Our Love Affair With Magazines**<br>
In this digital age, the love for print magazines still thrives as a reading format to delight readers who browse, borrow, or even buy copies of their own. Magazines appeal to readers through visuals and text, offering many hours of reading pleasure.

**Uniquely Singaporean Memories**<br>
What do you remember about Singapore? Are they bus tickets and transit-link cards; childhood games such as zero point, five stones or shopping at Yaohan and Oriental Emporium? When we go back to our past, we discover many shared memories of a time when wanton mee was five cents, cinemas were open-air, and bathing suits covered a lot more.
