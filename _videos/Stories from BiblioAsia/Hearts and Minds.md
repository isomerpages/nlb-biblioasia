This docudrama involves a tense showdown between Inspector Irene Lee (played by award-winning actress Jo Tan) of the Malayan Special Branch, and Lee Meng (played by Oon Shu An, above), the suspected head courier of the Malayan Communist Party. Does the steely Inspector Lee unearth the truth from the wily Lee Meng? The bravura performances by two talented actors will keep you riveted in your seats. 

This docudrama is inspired by actual events detailed in senior librarian Ronnie Tan’s essay, “[Hunting Down the Malayan Mata Hari](/vol-14/issue-1/apr-jun-2018/malayan-mata-hari/)”, which was published in the April–June 2018 issue of *BiblioAsia*.
