 #### _Hikayat Abdullah_&nbsp;(_The Story of Abdullah_) by Munshi Abdullah Abdul Kadir provides glimpses of life in early Singapore. Abdullah arrived in Singapore from Melaka about four months after Stamford Raffles established a trading post on the island in February 1819.
 
In our last two issues, we introduced the autobiography of Munshi Abdullah Abdul Kadir which was written in Jawi between 1840 and 1843 and published in 1849. The author was the interpreter and scribe to the founder of modern Singapore, Sir Stamford Raffles. 

In this issue, we continue to highlight stories from the Hikayat Abdullah (The Story of Abdullah). The Hikayat Abdullah provides glimpses of life in early Singapore. Abdullah arrived in Singapore from Malacca about four months after Singapore became a British trading port in 1819.

From Abdullahâ€™s accounts, Singapore was certainly not a place for the faint-hearted. It was used as a port by the pirates to plunder ships and boats sailing near Singapore.

*Syahadan, adapun pada masa itu, jangankan manusia*<br> *hendak lalu-lalang di laut Singapura itu, jin syaitan pun takut*, <br>*sebab di situlah bilik tempat perompak tidur, atau barang*<br> *di mana pun ia merompak kapal atau keci atau perahu*, <br>*dibawanyalah ke Singapura. Di situlah tempat ia membahagi*<br> *harta dan membunuh orangnya atau berbunuh-bunuhan*<br> *sesama sendirinya, sebab merebut harta itu, adanya*.1
