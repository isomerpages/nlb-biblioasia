The third batch of Officer Cadets from the first batch \[of full-time National Servicemen\] was of different races and from different backgrounds. Some were seconded-policemen, others were teachers, graduates, and even illegal taxi  drivers. Some spoke Hokkien, and others, 
English. I was slightly older than the rest.

The barracks at Pasir Labar SAFTI \[pictured\] had a tin roof and no fans. Training was hard. Cadets had to march with 20 kg field packs around the island \[Singapore\], and sandbags were added in cases of punishment. We did knuckle push-ups, and if it was as a punishment, with one or two claps-in between each push-up. There was also the change parade \[which has been since banned\]. —  Hong Tuck Chuen

I registered to be in the first batch of National Service enlistees in 1954 [the sit opposite tehe current Hai Nan Clan Association]. However, I was not accepted as the Singapore economy was doing badly at that time and there was a limit to the number of servicemen they could take in! — Ho Fook Cheong
