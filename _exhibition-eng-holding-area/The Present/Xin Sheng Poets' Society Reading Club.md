**About**:	Xin Sheng Poets' Society is dedicated to the scholarly study of Chinese poetry and the promotion of literary refinement within the community. Our structured programme operates on the first four Sunday afternoons of each month, during which two experienced instructors provide comprehensive guidance and detailed explication of classical poetry for society members and other enthusiasts of Chinese literature. These sessions are carefully designed to accommodate learners at various levels, from newcomers to classical poetry to those seeking deeper scholarly understanding.
