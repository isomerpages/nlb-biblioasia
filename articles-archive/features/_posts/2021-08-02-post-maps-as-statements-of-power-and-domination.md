I write this as an academic who also happens to be a collector Of antiquarian books, prints and maps of Southeast Asia. a hobby I have indulged in since my Late teens, and which has left me in a state of perpetual poverty as a result. Those who belong to this small fraternity Of aficionados will readily testify to the joy of collecting and the boundless pleasure of reading and appreciating books and maps that date back centuries. I am proud to say that although my passion has left me penniless, the state of destitution, thankfully, applies only to my wallet and not my sensibilities.

Antiquarian maps have long been sought after, for both their aesthetic as well as historical value. Those familiar with the workings of the antiquarian trade would know that such maps are also worthy investments in the long-run.

Having said that, the academic in me would also point to the academic worth of maps as documents of power and as records of the progression of power in the most comprehensive sense: both political - military as well as epistemic. Aside from the inherent beauty of some maps - and it should be noted that some antiquarian maps are undoubtedly visually stunning objects in themselves, deserving of appreciation as paintings and sculpture are - the added value of old maps is that they are historical records that document the march of exploration and conquest as well as the spread Of (geographic) knowledge of the world.

#### **MAPPING AND KNOWLEDGE: HOW WE COME TO KNOW THE WORLD **

In this essay I would Like to address the topic of maps and map-making and how maps can (and should) be read rather than simply merely looked at. By reading maps I mean that the map IS never simply a chart or a plan of territory, but also a statement (of intent or ambition) that can be interpreted and understood.

We need to begin with the premise that maps are never simply maps. Here is where we encounter the puzzle of maps and map making, and it is more an epistemic puzzle than a practical one. For if we were to start off with the Platonic premise that all forms of representation are merely that - representations of things as they really are â€” then all representations are to be regarded as counterfeit. What, then, is a map? And how do maps map the world? Granted that all maps are necessarily the product of human effort and are invariably tainted by subjective bias and the cultural perspectivism of the cartographer, they nevertheless need to correspond to some reality in order to fulfil their functions as maps that, well, map. But as representations of the world, maps merely stand for the "thing" that they represent. 

The philosopher Heidegger would interject by noting that the world of the thing-in-itself can never be known directly, but only through a (flawed, limited and subjective) human perspective. Taken In broad strokes, the upshot of this argument is that a map Of Asia therefore does not really "discover" Asia, but really invents Asia as it goes along.

Some might object to this argument on the grounds that maps illustrate things as they are in the world, but that misses the point: While it cannot be denied that things exist in the world, the more fundamental question is how those things come to be regarded as the things they are in the first place; which can only be a matter that is subjectively decided. For instance, elevations of earth and rock exist, but whether they exist as mountains or hills is a matter of subjective human judgement, and lie not in the things-in-themselves. There is, in fact. no universal standard that distinguishes the difference between hills and mountains, and the criteria differs from country to country. The American definition of a mountain is any land mass that rises to the height of a thousand feet. (610m) while in the United Kingdom, mountains need to be higher than two thousand feet (305m). (One country's mountain is another country's hill, evidently.)
