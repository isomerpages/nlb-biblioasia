#### **Episode Summary** ####
Curry powder is now commonly sold in pre-mixed packets, but in the past, people used to bring their spices to spice mills to have them ground, before mixing them at home. Well-known chef, cookbook author and culinary consultant Devagi Sanmugam talks about what life was like back then. She also whips up a quick beef rendang using a recipe from 1920, cooked with curry powder and eaten with spaghetti!

Chef Devagi made Mrs Kinsey’s “rundang” recipe from *The Mem's Own Cookery Book*. First published in 1920, the book contains 420 budget recipes based on local ingredients, such as lady's fingers and lentils, and local spices like curry powder, cloves and ginger.
