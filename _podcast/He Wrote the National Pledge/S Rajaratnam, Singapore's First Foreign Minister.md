---
<p>A journalist turned politician turned diplomat, S. Rajaratnam (1915–2006)
wore many hats in the service of Singapore. His contribution to Singapore
is so great that to cover his life adequately required 20 years of research
and over 1,200 pages of writing.&nbsp;Irene&nbsp;Ng, his authorised biographer,
tells us little-known facets of the man, his legacy as Singapore’s founding
foreign and culture minister, and his relationship with Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
