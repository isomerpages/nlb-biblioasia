<p><strong>Cheong Yip Seng</strong>
<br>To run the newsroom effectively, you need talent. Talented people will
not stay in the profession if they can only express one opinion. That's
an establishment opinion. They will not accept that. So, to retain talent,
I have to give them space. And fortunately, the government, at least LKY
recognises that. If the <em>Straits Times</em> has no credibility, it is
useless to him.</p>

<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>You’re listening to <em>BiblioAsia+</em>, a podcast produced by the National
Library of Singapore. At <em>BiblioAsia</em>, we tell stories about Singapore’s
past. Some familiar, others forgotten, all fascinating.</p>
<p>For close to two decades, Cheong Yip Seng has had the most important job
in Singapore's media industry: the editor-in-chief of the <em>Straits Times</em>.
He held this post from 1987 to 2006, back when the <em>Straits Times</em> was
still a colossus, a giant standing astride Singapore's media landscape.
Back in those days, the <em>Straits Times</em> was the main source of English
news in Singapore. And as a result, it shaped perceptions and set the agenda
in Singapore in a way that it probably doesn't do so much anymore, given
the current media landscape. A few years after leaving the <em>Straits Times</em>,
Cheong wrote his memoirs <em><a href="https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/redir/itemdetails?bid=14524272" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OB Markers: My Straits Times Story</a></em>.
Now in 2025, he has written a sequel titled <em><a href="https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/redir/itemdetails?bid=300118049" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Ink and Influence</a></em>.
Here to talk about his latest book is Cheong himself. Welcome to the <em>BiblioAsia</em>+
podcast, Cheong. It's very good to have you on the show.<br><br>
<strong>Cheong</strong>
<br>Thank you, Jimmy. It's a pleasure to be here.<br><br>
<strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Let's dive right in. You know, your first book, <em>OB Markers, </em>which
was published in 2013. Why do we need a sequel? What exciting things happened
between 2013 and now?</p>
<p><strong>Cheong</strong>
<br>Well, what happened was that there was one morning when my neighbours
and I were having breakfast at Ghim Moh market, and one of them, one of
my neighbours, lamented that he found it very difficult to get hold of
my first book. Then I explained to them that, you know SPH [Singapore Press
Holdings] decided not to continue printing that book. In fact, I wanted
at that time to ask the <em>Straits Times</em>, who jointly own the copyright
to the book, to let me revise the first book, because there are parts of
it which needed to be sorted out to tighten the narrative. And I also had
some additional material. So I wanted to contribute additional chapters
so that a revised edition of the book could be published, but the publisher
was not interested. So the person who raised this point with me at breakfast
was the guy who used to work for Simon &amp; Schuster, and he knew somebody
from Simon &amp; Schuster who is now with World Scientific Publishing.
And he knew that there was material that I could use for subsequent books,
and that was what started the ball rolling.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay, why should someone read this book <em>Ink and Influence</em>? You
know, what additional material is that? And in what way is it different
from your first book?
<br>
<br><strong>Cheong</strong>
<br>My first book is actually intended primarily for journalists, so that
they know the industry that they're going into, the challenges that they
will face, the opportunities that are available to them. And I wanted the
book to also encourage young, talented people to join the industry, because
I know that journalism is a very important part of society. So the book
was intended for that purpose.<br></p>
Since then, I know that a controversy erupted following my publisher publishing
a book, and I knew that there was some interest in this whole subject.
And after the first book was published, and after the conversation at breakfast,
I knew that this additional ground that I had intended to add to the first
book, which I could expand into a sequel.
<p></p><p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay. Maybe you can tell us a little bit about it.</p>
<p><strong>Cheong</strong><br>The additional ground that I had was to give more coverage to key moments
in our history, which I felt is important for Singaporeans to know. For
example, that major speech that Lee Kuan Yew made in the Malaysian Parliament
when the PAP [People’s Action Party] was in opposition in Malaysia. That
was a pivotal moment, and I’ve got additional material about that speech.
Talking to my chairman at that time, Lim Kim San, he was my chairman for
nearly the entire stretch of my tenure. And I was very fortunate that he
gave me a lot of time not to talk about work, but to go back into Singapore's
history. So he gave me a lot of material, which I felt, you know, is valuable
to share, because the Singapore story is a wonderful story.</p><p>But not many Singaporeans take the trouble to go into it. And I thought
that it would be a pity if people like me at my age, having gone through
so much, do not share these stories. And I feel that the stories would
be of some help to younger Singaporeans to understand how the country came
about. What are the milestones in our story over 60 years?</p>
<p>And I also decided that some of my journalistic experiences, for example,
during my travels going to China, going to work in Hong Kong, and some
of the things that our journalists did for society. After they've left
the profession, going into the arts, for example, SingLit.</p>
<strong>Jimmy</strong><br>Maybe you can tell us a bit about, you know, how the decision led to you
becoming editor-in-chief?
<p><strong>Cheong</strong><br>In 1987, the official visit to Singapore by the Israeli president, Chaim
Herzl, led to an enormous explosion in Malaysia. They protested, Indonesia
protested and wanted Singapore to scrap that visit. Because you know that
those two countries have no relations with Israel, and they saw the visit
as an affront to them.
</p><p>Singapore, of course, would not bow to that request. And there were demonstrations
in Malaysia. They were incensed. In fact, to the extent of some people,
some of them, these demonstrators lying on the railway track on the Causeway.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong><br>
Oh my goodness.</p>
<p><strong>Cheong</strong><br>
Yeah. And I think there were protests at the embassy, High Commission
in KL, and in Jakarta. Unfortunately, Lee Kuan Yew looked at the coverage
that the <em>Straits Times</em> provided and felt that we had underplayed
or tried to tone down the outrage that was felt by the Malays, and his
thinking was that the <em>Straits Times</em> should not shield our people.</p><p></p>
<p>We should not shield Singaporeans from what is really happening in Malaysia.
So unfortunately for us, we had relied on the <em>New</em>  <em>Straits Times</em> for
our Malaysia coverage to a very large extent because we do have an exchange
arrangement with the <em>New</em>  <em>Straits Times</em>. The paper that
really captured the raw feelings of the Malays was <em>Utusan Melayu</em> which
we did not, unfortunately, monitor.</p>
<p>So he was outraged that we had missed a fantastic opportunity to educate
the Singaporeans, that this is the nature of the neighbourhood that we
were living in, and for him, that episode led him to think that has reached
a point of no return for the <em>Straits Times</em>, and that was what forced
his hand and he insisted on a change of editorial leadership. That was
a trigger. Although before that, you know, we have got run-ins with him
every so often. But it did not lead to a change in the editorial leadership.
That was, for him, the last straw.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong><br>
You were Peter Lim's…</p>
<p><strong>Cheong</strong><br>
I was then Peter's deputy.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong><br>
That's right. How did you feel when you heard word that you were going
to take over Peter in this very tense moment?</p>
<strong>Cheong</strong><br>
Well, I had mixed feelings. I knew the ins and outs of our negotiations
with him with Lee Kuan Yew on how we can stabilise the relationship. There
were many attempts over many months, but nothing came out of it. So I wasn't
totally surprised by the change. But on the other hand, I was personally
quite happy to continue as Peter's deputy.
I thought we made a good team and there was no need for change. But since
change was forced on us, I just had to accept that the <em>Straits Times</em> is
an important Singapore institution. I think I have a contribution to make
to the paper, and I thought that this would be an opportunity to do so.
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong><br>
The <em>Straits Times</em> obviously is, I mean, was a very, very important
part of Singapore possibly, possibly not. Not so much now. But let's talk
about that point, you know, it was so important that the editor-in-chief
would regularly meet with people like LKY and all that, and they would
comment on your coverage and they would make suggestions on coverage.</p>
<p>I was a reporter in the <em>Straits Times</em> for three very short years
in the 90s. And I was, of course, a very low-level employee. I guess I
came from a position where, you know, we felt that the press needed more
independence, the whole fourth estate thing.</p>
<p>But I think you believe that's not really possible in Singapore.</p>
<p><strong>Cheong</strong><br>You see, this is the thinking of LKY at that time. He says that if he
is to effectively govern Singapore, he needs control over three things.
First, the Treasury, next the Army, and three, the media. Oh, he needs
control over these three institutions to effectively govern Singapore.
So that tells you his fundamental position, which means that he does not
accept that the press is the fourth estate on the grounds that, look, where’s
your mandate? The PAP has to go to the public every four or five years
to renew his mandate to govern. Who gives you the mandate to decide how
Singapore should be governed? So that was his fundamental position and
intellectually, it’s a sound position to take. You may disagree with it,
but he has the mandate.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong><br>
He certainly has that mandate. The <em>Straits Times</em> was also criticised
as being a mouthpiece for the government. But it is quite clear that there's
also a lot of pushback, so that the editors were not merely scribes taking
notes from the political leaders on what to do.</p>
<p><strong>Cheong</strong><br>
When I was in charge, I had a framework on how we should run the newsroom.
These are the following things I take into account. Number one, we do have
an efficient, incorruptible government, and that is a government that is
endorsed time and again at election by a large number of voters. In fact,
the PAP has always kept its two-thirds majority, at least two-thirds majority.</p>
<p>So it has popular support as well. So I take a pro-establishment stance
because that is how the majority of my readers feel about the government.
But having said that, I also know that there's a segment of my readership
who wants alternative voices and you know that the electorate is changing.
It wasn't like the earlier generations of Singaporeans who will, no matter
what happens, put the vote in to re-elect the PAP.</p>
<p>You now have a new electorate emerging who want alternative voices. And
the last election is very clear. The opposition was elected partly on the
grounds that the public wants an alternative voice. I've got to recognise
that need of our readers and I've got to provide a forum in the paper to
accommodate that desire. So I made sure that there is sufficient space
in the paper for these voices to be heard, for a diversity of opinion.</p>
<p>And the other consideration I had was, to run the newsroom effectively,
you need talent. Talented people will not stay in the profession if they
can only express one opinion. That's an establishment opinion. They will
not accept that. So to retain talent, I have to give them space. And fortunately,
the government, at least LKY recognises that. If the <em>Straits Times</em> has
no credibility, it is useless to him.</p>
<p>So while the government has got extensive powers over the media and I
know why, knowing the history of Singapore, I know why they want this expansive
power. I also know that without credibility, it means nothing. So the newsroom
has got cards to play. The government needs credibility. We need to keep
talent. So that gives me the space to negotiate the OB markers.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong><br>
As I mentioned in my introduction, the <em>Straits Times</em> had a monopoly
in effect of the English news in Singapore, you no longer have that monopoly
thanks to technology and all that probably no longer has quite that status.
The circulation of the paper has dropped quite a lot.</p>
<p>But in your opinion, what are the main causes of this?</p>
<p><strong>Cheong</strong><br>
Now, Jimmy, I have left the newsroom for nearly 20 years, so I'm no longer
in the loop. I do not know what the conditions editors today operate under.
So I'm speaking as somebody who is not in the loop, who is looking at the
paper and giving it his opinion. You have to remember that context, what
I see is that the newsroom is lacking a bunch of experienced editors, experienced
editors who could give closer guidance to the younger reporters. Now, I
must tell you that I can see in the paper today, the names of journalists
who, in my opinion, are gems but they need hand-holding, they need polishing,
they need guidance. Now, I was very fortunate in my time because during
my time, the <em>Straits Times</em> were making a heck lot of money and the
resources that I had enabled me to employ talented people in the newsroom.</p>
<p>My sense is that they are less well-endowed today because advertising
revenues are not what they were before, in fact, is very clearly demonstrated
by the fact that the government has to provide funding for the <em>Straits Times</em>.
So they have got a budget issue. So definitely a manpower issue in terms
of experience, editors who could provide guidance, who could help sharpen
the newsroom.</p>
<p>I noticed that this is obviously having an impact on the paper.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong><br>
Right. But surely also I think because of its monopoly, it was very important.
Everybody had to read the <em>Straits Times</em> in order to know what was
going on. And so it became the platform, right? I mean, Rajaratnam, after
he left cabinet, wanted to write letters to the paper. Goh Heng Swee as
well, right? Wrote pieces for the paper, which he was paid handsomely for.
It was the paper that was the platform. People who wanted their opinions
read had to be in it. I don't get a sense that's the case anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Cheong</strong><br>
I think what has dramatically changed is the media industry. They were
demolished or they were crushed by the advent of social media. Advertising
was sucked up by the social media outlets and advertising revenues declined.
And that is a very major change in the industry. So the <em>Straits Times</em>’s
importance was badly affected, as you pointed out, Jimmy, quite rightly.
The influence that the <em>Straits Times</em> enjoyed before the advent of
social media was enormous.</p>
<p><strong>Cheong</strong><br>
In fact, I know that at its peak, the <em>Straits Times</em> was selling
more than 400,000 copies a day. I don't think it is managing that number
today. In fact, they are putting more resources online, which is the right
thing to do. So the landscape has changed. The <em>Straits Times</em> is
no longer in the position that it enjoyed, and it has to adjust to the
new reality.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong><br>
Yeah. I want to go back to your book because actually your book has lots
of interesting anecdotes. You almost got arrested. Tell us about it. And
it wasn't for jaywalking or anything.</p>
<p><strong>Cheong</strong><br>
No, no, we had a wonderful reporter. Young reporter. You may remember
him. His name is Ronnie Wai, and he has the ability to bring in exclusive
stories. In fact, that was one of his strengths. And I had full confidence
that this is a guy whose sources are impeccable. So one day he came in
with the story which said that Lee Hsien Loong was leaving the army for
a new career.</p>
<p>The story was put on the front page. It ignited a small explosion in MINDEF.
They were concerned as to who was the one who leaked the story to Ronnie.
So I was summoned to the Ministry of Defence and I met Richard Magnus,
who was a senior counsel in MINDEF, and he demanded that I reveal the source
of Ronnie's story. I could not do that. I did indicate to Richard, who
subsequently became a good friend, indicated Richard, that is not something
I can do, because if I did that I would have destroyed the newsroom. Nobody
would subsequently talk to us.</p>
<p>I can't do that. So I was prepared to plead guilty if they prosecute me,
because Richard did indicate that he could prosecute me. And if I'm prosecuted,
there's a risk of a conviction and a jail term.</p>
<p>I had to be prepared to protect the integrity of a newsroom, to be sentenced.
I had no defence for publishing that because I know that you'll be in breach.
But I also knew that the ministry was anxious to know who leaked the story.
Legitimate demand. But I could not meet that demand. Fortunately, as I
subsequently found out, you know, they decided to give me a sharp knock
on the knuckles and let me off. So there was a brush.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong><br>
That was one of the most exciting times. I mean, give us an idea of, you
know, some of the hardest decisions you've had to make as the editor-in-chief.</p>
<p><strong>Cheong</strong><br>
Actually, I cannot immediately think of a very hard decision that I had
to make.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong><br>
Or maybe something that in hindsight, you wish you had done differently.</p>
<p><strong>Cheong</strong><br>
Well, that would have to do with the loss of some of our best people.</p><p>I felt that if I paid more attention to those people and assured them
that they have a future in the company, I would not lose them. But I soon
found that it was almost impossible to stop people from leaving for new
careers. That was impossible to do. Fortunately, I was able to retain quite
a lot of the talent that we had. So staff management or staff is a major
problem that I had to deal with.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong><br>
I think you alluded to that. Right. The importance of having talent.</p>
<p><strong>Cheong</strong><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong><br>
And getting talent to work for you.</p>
<p><strong>Cheong</strong><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong><br>
In <em>Ink and Influence</em> and as well as in <em>OB Markers</em>, you
talk about LKY’s own assessments of different writers and editors. Did
you agree with them or did you disagree?</p>
<p><strong>Cheong</strong><br>
On those issues, I can only agree to disagree. His view that certain writers
whose writing were not helpful to the government, I recognise that because
I know that they've got a view of their own. They belong to a younger generation
of reporters with bright minds. They don't have a worldview similar to
the PAP’s.</p>
<p>And I felt that it would be wrong to shut their voices down, because that
means I'll be driving them out of the newsroom. So I have to accept that
this is an unavoidable burden I have to bear. I have to disagree with their
assessment that these people are not helpful, because I see them in a different
light. But fortunately for me, it did not lead to the best consequences.</p>
<p>They were prepared to accept the realities in the newsroom, and for that
I give them a lot of credit. And I also like to give credit to Lim Kim
San, who was my chairman. He accepted my argument that we could not suppress
our younger talented writers. So I'm grateful for the concession that they
make to us.</p>
<p>So contrary to the popular opinion outside that government, in particular
Lee Kuan Yew has total control of the media, that is not so. He was prepared
to accept the realities and live with the consequences. In fact, there
were one or two occasions when he wanted me to remove the editor from our
newsroom, one from the <em>Straits Times</em> and one from <em>Berita Harian.</em> I
resisted the idea and he did not push his way, so I respected him for that.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong><br>
Let me turn to negotiating OB markers. On one hand, you have the journalistic
instinct to break a good story. On the other hand, there are these limits
to where the paper is willing to go. What is that principle that underlies
how you make that decision?</p>
<p><strong>Cheong</strong><br>
My job is to manage the interests of three stakeholders. The readers of
the <em>Straits Times</em>, my customers. The government is another stakeholder
and the third stakeholder is the newsroom, the journalists. The stakeholders
may have different interests. My job is trying to balance those interests.
I learn, fortunately, from the experiences of my predecessors. And there's
one example which I like to share that tells you how you need to negotiate
the different forces at play.</p>
<p>In 1977, Lee Kuan Yew made a visit to the Philippines and he and President
Marcos came up with a very pivotal agreement. They agreed to slash tariffs
of exports between the two countries to 10 percent. That was a major breakthrough
because the PAP government's policy at that time, their goal was to bring
about an ASEAN where goods can move about within ASEAN tariff-free.</p>
<p>There's a major, major breakthrough for Lee Kuan Yew, but unfortunately
for us, a major story broke in Singapore. One guy stole a rifle from the
army camp and helped people hostage, and that hostage drama took 72 hours.</p>
<p>The hostage crisis gripped the attention of the entire Singapore. The
editor at the time, of course, succumbing to the instincts of a professional
journalist, gave a lot of play to the hostage. But he also took care to
put the tariff story on the front page. But that was not sufficient for
Lee Kuan Yew because he felt by playing up the stories in that manner,
we are signaling wrongly to ASEAN that is an agreement of little consequence.</p>
<p>As a journalist, guided by professional principles, you have to bear in
mind that this is a story that interests the bulk of your population.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong><br>
Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>Cheong</strong><br>
So you give it a lot of play on the front page. The lesson that I drew
from that episode was that the <em>Straits Times</em> must also bear in mind
the politics at play. Politics requires the right signaling. At [the] time,
I was not in charge of the paper, but if I were now in charge of the paper
and I [am] faced with the same situation, I would have redesigned the front
page in such a way that gave equal prominence to the story, letting the
political sensitivities be one of the issues that I would contend with
in negotiating these boundaries.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong><br>
Right? If it does, it is very hard to clearly see a guy taking a rifle
and holding someone hostage. It’s very, very newsworthy.</p>
<p><strong>Cheong</strong><br>
Another example, Jimmy, would be I suppose, a few months after I took
over in 1987, another major story broke. The government had arrested a
bunch of people and labelled them Marxists, the Marxist conspiracy in 1987.
But I also do know that many of these people were active church activists.
Were they social activists, do gooders, or were they people with a more
sinister agenda?</p>
<p>Now, I had to be conscious about these two sides of the story, the government
labelling them as sinister people, but another segment of society regarding
them as social activists who did not deserve to be detained. So I’ve got
these two narratives. What was my major consideration? How do I play this
story? My first priority is to make sure that this episode will not lead
to a collusion between the state and the Catholic Church, because if there
were a collusion, the fabric of Singapore would be severely, severely damaged.
We will puncture the social solidarity that we enjoy. So keeping that in
mind helps in negotiating the OB markers.</p>
<p>So some people, for example, were disappointed with our coverage of the
Marxists conspiracy. They felt that we had not given sufficient weight
to the social activists’ point of view. We did articulate it, but we did
not play it up because who are we to decide? Because I don't have the information
that the government has.</p>
<p>So we were operating at a huge disadvantage vis-à-vis the government,
and bearing in mind the need to avoid a collision, I had to accept the
criticisms of some of my readers, not totally illegitimate that I had underplayed
the story of the activists, but it's a price I have to pay, in my opinion,
to protect the stability in Singapore.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong><br>
In your opinion, and of course, it's just prognostications and crystal
ball gazing. But in 10 years, what you know, what will the <em>Straits Times</em> look
like? You know, 10, 20 years? Will the paper still be around? I mean, the
internet has wiped out huge swaths of the media around the world, right?
Singapore is no exception.</p>
<p><strong>Cheong</strong><br>
I was heartened that the government decided to provide some funding because
without funding, the <em>Straits Times</em> will further shrivel without
the resources. So to me, that is a very important signal that the <em>Straits Times</em> does
have a place in [the] future in Singapore. So how can we make use of this
space that we are being provided with? And I felt that there's one way
to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong><br>
I think that the government will continue doing this if it feels that
there's a value in doing this, right? And so which means that the <em>Straits Times</em> needs
to remain relevant to its readers. It needs to find some way to negotiate
the new social media landscape and occupy a niche that is usefully played.</p>
<p>Do you think it is currently doing so?</p>
<p><strong>Cheong</strong><br>
I believe that it can because I don't think that the government will fund
SPH and not make sure that funding is fully justified. Justifications can
only come from a service that the <em>Straits Times</em> and SPH provides,
and it must provide a useful service to Singapore. Now I'm thinking in
terms of serving the best interests of Singapore. That is a starting point,
I think.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong><br>
I don't disagree with you, but I think that really the challenge is, you
know, getting people interested in reading about the news, which even in
its heyday was always, you know, so easy.</p>
<p><strong>Cheong</strong><br>
A challenge, yes. But I believe that the problem is not insurmountable.
My tried and tested method of tackling such problems is one word – talent.
You have to find the right talent, the talent will deliver the results.
And I believe that in Singapore, we have the ability to attract talent.
We are an open society.</p>
<p>In my time, I had to look for talent not only within Singapore but outside
Singapore. So we had a large foreign component in our team, and I cannot
believe that we should not continue to do that. If you’re well-focused,
I don't believe it’s an insurmountable problem, and talented people will
deliver. I know that from experience.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong><br>
I certainly hope you are right because, you know, I have many fond memories
and many not so fond memories as well, but certainly many fond memories
of the <em>Straits Times</em>. And it would be a shame if the <em>Straits Times</em> were
not around in 10 years or whatever. It would be a tremendous shame.</p>
<p>And it is my hope that the <em>Straits Times</em> is able, in some way to
find a relevance, and find some way towards profitability, which is important,
right? Because if it's not profitable, it's not a going concern as a business.
It's not going to survive.</p>
<p><strong>Cheong</strong><br>
Well, Jimmy, I owe a lot to the <em>Straits Times</em> which has given me
a wonderful career. And I sincerely believe that there is a place for the <em>Straits Times</em> in
Singapore's future. But a lot also depends on how the newsroom reacts to
the changes that are going around. And I believe that they can find a niche
in the market.</p>
<p>It may not enjoy the same reach as it did before, but I think it will
find enough readers and enough important readers to justify their existence.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong><br>
Well, I certainly hope so. How did you know that you wanted to be a journalist?</p>
<p><strong>Cheong</strong><br>
I had a wonderful job as a teacher in a primary school. I really enjoyed
my time and I enjoyed going to [Teachers’] <s></s>Training <s></s>College
because I enjoyed teaching. But when the opportunity to join the <em>Straits Times</em> arose,
my colleagues were pressing me and said<s></s> you'd be foolish not to
go.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong><br>
Really? Why?</p>
<p><strong>Cheong</strong><br>
They felt that I would do better for myself if I'd move to the media industry
than in teaching. Well, they were proven right, but I was also tempted
by one point in the small ad that I saw and it said special grade $1,000
and above. To me it was a gold mine.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong><br>
Okay. This was more than what you were getting paid as a teacher?</p>
<p><strong>Cheong</strong><br>
Oh yes, oh yes. A lot. Five times more.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong><br>
Oh, okay. I would have been...</p>
<p><strong>Cheong</strong><br>
I would have left already. I was born a news junkie. I always enjoyed
the news. In fact, in my secondary school years, I used to produce a newsletter
for my neighbour’s handwritten newsletter. I picked up news items from
the <em>Straits Times</em> and from the <em>Reader's Digest</em> magazines,
and I put together a newsletter.</p>
<p>So I was a news junkie by nature. And then now you've got this carrot
of a monetary incentive combined. It was irresistible and I was very fortunate
that there was a panel headed by Wee Kim Wee who interviewed a bunch of
us. And when I got a job, I left [teaching].</p>
<p>It turned out to be the correct thing to do because eight months after
I joined the <em>Straits Times</em>, Singapore was in real deep trouble.
Riots had broken up twice that year, July and September. Indonesian marines
were planting bombs all over Singapore to intimidate Singaporeans, intimidate
Malaysians. So I'll plunge into the deep end.</p>
<p>And it provided me with a real political education, something that I would
not get if I'd been doing some other work. So that was what anchored me
to the industry.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong><br>
It’s very seductive, right? The front row seat into the making of history.</p>
<p><strong>Cheong</strong><br>
Yes, that's right. And subsequently the decision to move turned out to
be correct because it gave me a rare opportunity which not many people
get the opportunity to see at close range. How the founding generation
of Singapore worked, and developing a relationship with them that gave
me further insights into how Singapore grew and [I] enjoyed their friendship.
There was something precious.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong><br>
In your entire career, you know who was the person that you know left
its biggest mark? The greatest intellectual impact.</p>
<p><strong>Cheong</strong><br>
No doubt whatsoever who that person is. Lee Kuan Yew. He is a giant of
a man.</p>
<p>He taught me one very major lesson – that whatever you face, always start
by looking at the big picture. He did not tell me in those terms, but I
could see that was how he operated. He always looked at the big picture.
He always looked at the geopolitics before he decided to make his political
decision.</p>
<p>And that was a major valuable lesson. I learned that whatever challenge
you may have, the challenge would diminish in size if you are able to see
the big picture.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong><br>
Obviously, knowing the big picture then allows you to make better decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Cheong</strong><br>
Yes, because life is all about managing different interests. As I said,
I deal with the interests of three stakeholders:<s>,</s> the readers, the
government and the journalists. And all three have got different agendas.
How do you deal with these conflicting demands of your shareholders? You
can't deal with it if you don't have the big picture. So that helped me
a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong><br>
I hope I'm not too old to learn this lesson and apply it in my own life.
Cheong, thank you for coming on the <em>BiblioAsia</em>+ podcast. It was
really a pleasure having you. Cheong's new book, <em>Ink and Influence</em>: <em>An OB Markers Sequel</em>,

And it's also available on Kindle.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong><br>
Both editions?</p>
<p><strong>Cheong</strong><br>
No, no, the first book<em> OB Markers.</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong><br>
Oh, it's available on Kindle.</p>
<p><strong>Cheong</strong><br>
That is available on Kindle, because<s></s> when I was pressing the <em>Straits Times</em>, when are you going to do a reprint, because if you're not going to do a reprint, the copyright reverts to me entirely
</p><p><strong>Jimmy</strong><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Cheong</strong><br>
They don't want to lose the copyright. So they come to me by saying that
I put it on Kindle.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong><br>
Oh, okay. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Cheong</strong><br>
That was a very brilliant move on their part.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong><br>
Cheong, thank you once again for coming on the show. And it's been a pleasure
having you and I wish you good luck in your future endeavours.</p>
<p><strong>Cheong</strong><br>
Thank you Jimmy, it has been an interesting experience today.</p>
