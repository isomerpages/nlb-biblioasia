In the first half of the 20th century, major cities around the world began to witness a new phenomenon: the emergence of the Modern Girl.1 She was almost instantly recognisable with her distinctive wavy bobbed hair, painted lips, slim body (often with her arms and back exposed), and always impeccably dressed in the latest fashion.2 A historically specific expression of modernity and femininity, she appeared almost simultaneously in cities like Beijing, Bombay, Tokyo and New York during the interwar years. 

The Modern Girl was also a phenomenon in Singapore of course. As diplomat-turned-writer R.H. Bruce Lockhart noted in his memoirs, women here – particularly Straits Chinese women – had changed significantly by 1933 compared with the early 1900s. “Gone, too, is the former seclusion of the better-class Chinese women, and to-day Chinese girls, […] all with bobbed and permanently waved hair in place of the former glossy straightness, and all dressed in semi-European fashion, walk vigorously through the streets on their way to their studies or to their games.”3

Departing from the traditional female roles of “dutiful daughter, wife and mother”,4 women were becoming increasingly involved in activities such as working, sports, and smoking and drinking, which were previously considered the domains of men.5 These social changes were in part motivated by the rise of feminism, the development of women’s suffrage movements in places like Britain, America and India, and more women participating in nationalist movements.6

According to the Modern Girl Around the World Research Group based in the University of Washington, American corporations were “the most important international distributor of imagery associated with the Modern Girl, especially because of US pre-eminence in the international distribution of advertising and film”.7 Hence, the image of the Modern Girl, and her associated iconology and ideologies, found their way across the globe through the worldwide channels of multinational corporations, print media and the American film industry. By the late 1920s, the Modern Girl had made her debut in Singapore. 

#### **A Modern Girl By Any Other Name**
While the term “Modern Girl” first appeared during the 1920s and 30s, the use of the term “girl” was popularised in England in the late 19th century and referred to “working-class and middle-class unmarried women who occupied an ephemeral free space between childhood and adulthood.” By the 1920s and 30s, however, “girl” had come to refer to young women who aspired to subvert conventional female roles and expectations.8

The Modern Girl went by different names in different places. In the US, she was sometimes known as a “flapper”, in China as 摩登小姐 (modeng xiaojie; modern young lady) and in India as kallege ladki (college girl). In Singapore, the English-language press commonly referred to her as the Modern Girl or Modern Woman. Regardless of what she was called, Modern Girls were identified as young women with an “up-to-date and youthful femininity”, provocative in behaviour and fashion that drew influence from other countries.9

As international companies began customising their advertisements to appeal to domestic markets, local companies started adopting the advertising strategies of international companies.10 By the 1930s, local businesses had begun constructing a Modern Girl relatable to the masses in Singapore. Advertisements in Singapore’s vernacular and other English press targeted at local Asians often featured a female with features drawn from elsewhere, yet sporting elements distinctive to the cultures of the region (such as the muslim headscarves and the coloured dot known as bindi that Indian women wear on their foreheads).
