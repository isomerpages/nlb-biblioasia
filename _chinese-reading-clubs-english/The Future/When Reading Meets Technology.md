#### **Introduction**

In the wave of modern technology, traditional reading clubs are revitalised with fresh energy and purpose. Technology has not only enhanced the convenience of literary discussions but also expanded the possibilities for reading clubs, breathing entirely new life into them.

#### **Transcending Geographic Limitations**

Firstly, technology has significantly expanded the reach of reading clubs. In the past, reading clubs were often constrained by geographic boundaries, with members mostly being readers from the same city or region. However, with the help of WeChat, Zoom, and other video conferencing platforms, as well as various online groups, reading club members can now transcend geographic limitations and communicate in real-time online. Regardless of location, as long as one has an internet connection, one can participate in vibrant discussions and share reading insights and reflections. This hybrid online-offline model not only overcomes geographic barriers but also breaks down cultural walls, bringing together readers from different cultural backgrounds and life experiences to explore literary works collectively and share their personal journeys.

#### **Enhanced Communication and Shared Resources**

Secondly, social media and instant messaging tools provide more flexible and convenient communication channels for reading clubs. Members can use platforms like Facebook and WeChat groups to share reading insights, recommend books, and organise online voting for book selections anytime, anywhere. This real-time interaction greatly strengthens connections between members, fostering mutual understanding and trust. Members can communicate at any time, share reading progress, ask questions, and resolve doubts, forming a tightly knit knowledge community. Additionally, some reading clubs have established dedicated digital libraries or resource-sharing platforms online, allowing members to access relevant materials conveniently at any time, further enhancing the efficiency and accessibility of reading clubs.

#### **Staying Current with Technology**

To better leverage technology and enhance the efficiency and quality of reading clubs, members need to continuously learn new technologies and tools, improving their digital literacy. This requires proactive leadership from organisers, who should provide essential training and support to help members master emerging technologies and embrace evolving communication methods.  Equally important is comprehensive cybersecurity education that builds members' awareness and equips them to navigate online risks safely.

#### **Conclusion**

In summary, technological advancement has brought revolutionary changes to how reading clubs operate. It has not only expanded participation and improved communication efficiency, but also enriched the formats and content of reading clubs. In the future, as technology continues to evolve, reading clubs will integrate even more closely with technology, creating exciting new possibilities and adding vibrancy to people's reading lives. This fusion of technology and humanities in reading clubs will further inspire people's passion for reading and transform reading into a more accessible, enriching, and enjoyable experience.
