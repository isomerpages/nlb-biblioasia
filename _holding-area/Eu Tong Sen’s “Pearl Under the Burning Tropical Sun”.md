#### The grandeur and opulence of Eu Villa on Mount Sophia was unrivalled in its heyday.
By Patricia Lin

Eu Villa, the home of Eu Tong Sen (1877–1941), was perhaps the most spectacular mansion to be built in Singapore in the early years of the 20th century that was owned by a Straits Chinese. Nicknamed “the King of Tin”, Eu was also the man behind traditional Chinese medicine retailer Eu Yan Sang.

Eu was born in Penang on 23 July 1877 but received his early education in Foshan, China. His father Eu Kong, who left his hometown of Foshan for Penang in 1873, was a self-made millionaire. The elder Eu had the foresight to later venture into business in the then remote town of Gopeng in the Kampar district of Perak.[^1]&nbsp;
