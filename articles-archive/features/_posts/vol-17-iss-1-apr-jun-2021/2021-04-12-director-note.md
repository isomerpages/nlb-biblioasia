Our cultural beliefs influence how we view the natural environment as well as our understanding and attitudes towards animals and plants. These views and perceptions impact our relationship with the natural world.

Some people see nature as wild and chaotic while others view nature as orderly, acting according to natural “laws”. There are those who perceive nature as an economic resource to be exploited for profit or for human enjoyment, yet there are also many who strongly believe that nature should be left untouched to flourish in its natural state. 

This issue of BiblioAsia looks at how human activities over the past 200 years have affected and transformed our physical environment, and how we are still living with the consequences today. This special edition accompanies an exciting new exhibition launched by the National Library – “Human x Nature” – at the Gallery on Level 10 of the National Library Building on Victoria Street. Do visit the exhibition, which will run until September this year.

[Georgina Wong](https://nlb-ba-staging.netlify.app/vol-17/issue-1/apr-jun-2021/humanxnature), one of the curators of the show, opens this issue by exploring the relationship between European naturalists and the local community as plants and animals new to the West were uncovered. Not unexpectedly, indigenous input was often played down, dismissed, or exoticised. [Farish Noor](https://nlb-ba-staging.netlify.app/vol-17/issue-1/apr-jun-2021/magic) examines this phenomenon by taking a hard look at Walter Skeat’s book Malay Magic.

[Faris Joraimi](https://nlb-ba-staging.netlify.app/vol-17/issue-1/apr-jun-2021/malayan-fruits) sees a similar impulse at work as he examines the beautiful paintings of Malayan fruits in the Dumbarton Oaks collection, which relied on anonymous Chinese artists and Malay informants.

One exception to the rule was Ishak Ahmad, whose knowledge helped create an understanding of the economic potential of the seas around Malaya. [Anthony Medrano](https://nlb-ba-staging.netlify.app/vol-17/issue-1/apr-jun-2021/ishak-ahmad) outlines the contributions of the man who, among other things, was the father of Yusof Ishak, Singapore’s first president.

Turning our gaze landward, we look at the environmental destruction caused by humans. [Timothy Pwee](https://nlb-ba-staging.netlify.app/vol-17/issue-1/apr-jun-2021/agriculture) documents the history of plantation agriculture as [Chia Jie Lin](https://nlb-ba-staging.netlify.app/vol-17/issue-1/apr-jun-2021/deforestation) (the exhibition’s co-curator) examines the impact of deforestation caused by these plantations. [Ang Seow Leng](https://nlb-ba-staging.netlify.app/vol-17/issue-1/apr-jun-2021/nature) explores how attitudes towards conservation have evolved over time while [Fiona Tan](https://nlb-ba-staging.netlify.app/vol-17/issue-1/apr-jun-2021/beastly-business) writes about a failed attempt to control the wildlife trade in 1930s Singapore.

For most city dwellers, the closest we have to nature is the greenery in our housing estates and the easily accessible parks and recreational areas. All this is thanks to a deliberate effort to turn Singapore into a Garden City. [Lim Tin Seng](https://nlb-ba-staging.netlify.app/vol-17/issue-1/apr-jun-2021/greening) tells us how that vision has evolved since the 1960s.

Also, don’t miss [Michelle Heng’s](https://nlb-ba-staging.netlify.app/vol-17/issue-1/apr-jun-2021/poetry) essay about Singaporean poets who have tackled nature in their work and [Jacqueline Lee’s](https://nlb-ba-staging.netlify.app/vol-17/issue-1/apr-jun-2021/manvsnature) piece highlighting how writers of speculative fiction envisage Singapore’s environmental future.

We hope this issue amply demonstrates that the fates of humanity and nature are ultimately intertwined.

I think we can all agree that 2020 was a challenging year. Like many people, I’m looking forward to a much better year ahead.


And for those of us with a sweet tooth, what better way to start 2021 than to tuck into buttery rich *kueh lapis*? [Christopher Tan’s](/vol-16/issue-4/jan-mar-2021/kueh-lapis) essay on the origins of this mouth-watering layered cake from Indonesia – made of eggs, butter, flour and spices – is a feast for the senses, and very timely too, given the upcoming Lunar New Year.

Still on the subject of eggs, you should read [Yeo Kang Shua’s](/vol-16/issue-4/jan-mar-2021/st-andrew-cathedral) examination of Madras *chunam*, the plaster made from, among other things, egg white and sugar. It is widely believed to have been used on the interior walls of St Andrew’s Cathedral. Kang Shua sets the record straight.

Given the current predilection for toppling statues of contentious historical figures, poet and playwright [Ng Yi-Sheng](/vol-16/issue-4/jan-mar-2021/raffles) argues that Raffles has already been knocked off his pedestal – figuratively speaking that is.

From a familiar historical figure, we turn to a relatively unknown personality – Kunnuck Mistree, a former Indian convict who remade himself into a successful and respectable member of society. [Vandana Aggarwal](/vol-16/issue-4/jan-mar-2021/kunnuck) ferrets out the facts to uncover a fascinating story of redemption in 19th-century Singapore.

For a break from these heavy topics, check out our delightful [photo essay on the children](/vol-16/issue-4/jan-mar-2021/young-ones) of the 1960s from the collection of the National Archives. And sadly, as [Robinsons](/vol-16/issue-4/jan-mar-2021/robinsons) too fades into history, we shine a spotlight on some not-so-well-known aspects of its storied past.

Speaking of spotlights, one of my favourite essays in this issue is the one on the history of street lighting in Singapore. [Timothy Pwee](/vol-16/issue-4/jan-mar-2021/light) takes what might have been a dull subject and turns it into an illuminating (pun intended) read.

I’d also like to draw your attention to the essay that highlights the National Library’s rich collection of rare paper-based artefacts. We have more than 19,000 items and our recent book, *[Stories from the Stacks](/vol-16/issue-4/jan-mar-2021/stacks)*, showcases a small selection of them, including a manual of football rules in Jawi, a colonial-era list of Tamil names, and a copy of a 15th-century Chinese map that mentions Temasek.

These are just a few of the interesting articles that await you in this issue. Make yourself a nice cuppa (perhaps with a slice of *kueh lapis*), sit back, and slowly savour these essays. We enjoyed putting this issue together and we hope you will equally enjoy reading it.
