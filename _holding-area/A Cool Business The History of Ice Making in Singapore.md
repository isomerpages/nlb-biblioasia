#### Ice has been an indispensable commodity in tropical Singapore since the late 19th century.  
By Goh Lee Kim

There’s nothing like downing an ice-cold drink on a scorching hot day. And in Singapore, hot days are aplenty. But the option to grab a cold drink wasn’t always readily available. Before mechanical ice-making was invented, ice had to be imported into Singapore. Blocks of ice were cut out from frozen lakes and rivers and shipped in, a journey that would take many months. Of course, by the time the cargo arrived, up to half of the ice would have melted despite the thick sawdust insulation.

The lack of ice and refrigeration meant that food items like meat and fish were highly perishable. “At present meat requires to be cooked on the same day on which it is killed and the consequence is that it is but too frequently most horribly tough and difficult of mastication,” reported the <i> Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser </i> in 1845.[^1] European residents missed their cheese, butter and fruits such as apples and grapes. For long-term meat storage, meats were preserved or cured using methods like adding saltpetre (potassium or sodium nitrate).

#### **Whampoa’s Ice House**
In 1854, prominent merchant Hoo Ah Kay (better known as Whampoa) and his partner Gilbert Angus began to import natural ice from America for his Ice House in Boat Quay. This provided residents in Singapore with their first supply of ice. “A great boon has been conferred upon the community of Singapore by the establishment of an ice house which has now been in operation for several months,” the <i>Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser</i> reported. “We trust that the spirited projectors of this public benefit will receive such support and encouragement as to induce them to render their undertaking a permanent one.”[^2] 

Sadly, the venture did not last more than three years and by 30 November 1857, Whampoa had left the partnership due to heavy financial losses.[^3]
American company Tudor Ice took over Ice House in 1861 but did no better, also incurring losses and leaving frustrated residents stranded with supply disruptions stretching months. “It was repeatedly stated by Mr [Frederic] Tudor’s managers that the consumption was not nearly sufficient to meet the cost of the ice and other expenses, and that a loss had been incurred by that gentleman of nearly $20,000, and further that unless a much greater quantity was sold the supply must be stopped,” the <i>Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser</i> reported in December that year.[^4]  

Fortunately, for Singapore residents, 1861 was also the year that Singapore Ice Works opened its doors on River Valley Road. In August, the company became the first to make and sell ice produced locally. It was sold for three cents per pound, two cents lower than imported ice. The company’s proprietor, Riley, Hargreaves &amp; Co., had sunk in a fortune to procure the latest ice-making machinery for the venture, which quickly gained public support due to its more stable supply compared to Tudor.[^5]

“The public must now decide whether it will support an establishment which will ensure a permanent supply of ice [Singapore Ice Works], or give the preference to a person who offers no guarantee that he will keep up a more regular import [Tudor] than has hitherto been the case,” wrote the <i>Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser</i> in December 1861. By 1865, Tudor had closed after the government enforced the sale of Ice House to Singapore Ice Works over the former’s supply disruptions.[^6] (The building once occupied by Ice House continued to stand in Boat Quay until it was demolished in 1981 for the widening of River Valley Road; a replica in Clarke Quay is still around today.[^7])

#### **A Necessary Commodity**

Other companies began to enter the market, increasing the overall supply of ice to the island. Singapore Ice Works thrived as the main ice factory until February 1881 when Straits Ice Company, owned by Howarth, Erskine &amp; Co., began operations.[^8]

The resulting price war ended with the sale of Singapore Ice Works in June 1882 to Howarth, Erskine &amp; Co., which amalgamated both companies and appointed Katz Brothers as its agent, selling a pound of ice at one-and-a-half cents.[^9] The Singapore Distilled Water Ice Company (later renamed New Singapore Ice Works) subsequently opened in March 1890.[^10] The factory used to be at Sungei Road until it relocated in 1984. Thanks to the factory, the area became known as Gek Sng Kio (结霜桥, meaning “Frosted Bridge” in Hokkien).[^11]

By the 1890s, ice was seen as a necessity. An article in the <i>Straits Budget</i> in January 1897 waxed lyrical about ice. “Where should we be without it! We might, at a pinch, do without many things. Whiskey, for instance, might go, though heaven forfend; we could even abolish the harmless necessary soda; but ice we cannot do without. Ice is like the dew from heaven; it blesses all alike. It cools parched palates and heated brows; it is a boon either in the sick chamber or the banquetting hall.”[^12]

A lack of cold storage facilities still prevented residents from obtaining meat, dairy and produce from further afield though. Similarly, tropical fruits from the region could not be exported to Europe. In December 1898, the <i>Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser</i> proposed having “a cold storage establishment in Singapore as a depot not only for fruit export but meat import and distribution”. “Consider how even tinned butter would gain by issue in a firm state instead of the nauseous oily condition that it presents on opening a tin [without cold storage],” the paper added.[^13]

The availability of clean, imported frozen food became a reality in 1903 with the establishment of the Cold Storage Company in Singapore, which brought into the market frozen meat, fruit and dairy products from places as far away as Australia. Since ice was an essential component in its business, the company soon expanded into ice manufacturing in 1916 with its own plant. Its strategic location at Borneo Wharf in New Harbour (Keppel Harbour today) meant that ice could be quickly loaded onto ships, giving it an edge over its competitors.[^14] By 1919, Cold Storage had emerged as the main manufacturer of ice in Singapore.[^15]
