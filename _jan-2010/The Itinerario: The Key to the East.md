####  Senior Librarian _Bonny Tan_ explores _Itinerario_, a book by Dutchman Jan Huygen van Linschoten that opened the secret passageway to the east for the Dutch and English.

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*“There is no time more wasted than when a young fellow<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;hangs bout his mother’s kitchen like a baby, neither knowing<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;what poverty is, nor luxury, nor what is found in the world,<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;an ignorance which is often the cause of his ruin.”*1 <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Jan Huygen van Linschoten

Since Vasco de Gama sailed to India in 1498, the Portuguese dominated trade between Asia and Europe for almost a century until their rivals, the Dutch and the English, found the key that unlocked the secret passageway to the East. That key was a book — the *Itinerario*, published in 1596 by Dutchman Jan Huygen van Linschoten. His publication remains a valued work not only for its detailed description of sea roads and conditions in Asia, but also for its beautiful engravings, early modern maps and insights into the cultures and commodities of the region.

#### **Linschoten — Life at the Confluence**
**In Spain**

Linschoten was born in Haarlem, Netherlands, in 1563 2 and as a young and “idle” man, he had been “addicted to see and travel”, his passion fed through “the reading of histories and strange adventures”.3 During Linschoten’s youth, Holland and Spain were often in conflict. Despite this, trade between the Dutch and the Spanish remained vibrant and Dutchmen frequently headed to Spain for employment or business. Among them were two of Linschoten’s brothers, followed inevitably by Linschoten who journeyed out when he was 17,4 travelling to Seville in a convoy of 80 ships. There Linschoten hoped to master the mariner’s lingua franca — Spanish — so that he could travel even further.

The key moments in Linschoten’s life and the publication of his work came coincidentally at the confluence of several political events. Take, for example, his arrival in Spain. The Portuguese king, Don Henry, had died without an heir and had stated in his will that his sister’s son, Philip, the reigning  King of Spain, be crowned King of Portugal in 1580, uniting once archrivals Spain and Portugal in a tenuous fashion.

**In Goa**

Meanwhile, a learned Dominican monk, Don Frey Vincente de Fonseca, known to both Spanish and Portuguese royal houses, was appointed Archbishop of Goa by the king. Linschoten’s elder half-brother, Willem Tin, was already appointed clerk in the fleet heading to India. He helped enter his younger brother into the services of the archbishop. Thus Linschoten and his brother along with 38 others were recruited and sailed for Goa, India, on 8 April 1583.

Arriving at Goa in September that same year, Linschoten remained for five years until 1588, never travelling further than the surroundings of Goa. Since much of Portuguese trade to and from Asia transited at Goa, it was here that tradesmen and travellers would rendezvous after or along the way to making that mystical journey to the East. Linschoten was privy to the latest information on the East Indies, gathered through interviews with various merchants and navigators. He kept a concise diary of the people interviewed as well as his own sojourns — a tradition common among 16th century travellers — which would later serve as a useful resource for his landmark publication.

It was as secretary and later as tax officer to the archbishop of Goa that Linschoten had access to the confidential *portolans* (a sailing chart or publication of sea routes and maritime navigation in textual form, derived from the Italian term portolani) and sensitive trade information meant only for high officials in the Portuguese government, giving his publication the edge over all previous guides to the East. Linschoten likely derived information from Vicente Rodrigues who was famed for his *roteiro* (same as *portolan* except that it is a Portuguese term), the first of which is found only in Linschoten’s *Itinerario*.5 The text also shows evidence that Linschoten referred to learned books and descriptions such as *Os Lusiades* by Camoes, and from Garcia de Orta on Goa, Gonzalez de Mendoza on China and Christavao da Costa on medicinal herbs.6

In fact, Linschoten’s description of sea routes was considered so accurate that Peter Floris, who journeyed to the Strait of Singapore in 1613, close to 20 years after Linschoten had published the work, said that the passageway was so well described7 “that it cannot bee mended for wee have founde all juste as hee hath described it, so that a man needeth no other judge or pilote butt him.”8 And this description comes from a man who had never been in the Malay Archipelago.

**The Return**

Linschoten’s love for India was such that he had wanted to remain there possibly for life, but the death of his patron, the archbishop, in 1587 9 led him to return to Europe in 1589. It was on this trip back that he reconnected with Gerrit van Afhuysen from Antwarpe with whom he had been acquainted while in Lisbon. Travelling together, their ships anchored at Tercera to escape British ships, near the Azores; but the seasonal winds foundered the ship laden with Malaccan treasures. Afhuysen persuaded Linschoten to remain in Tercera to recover the important cargo and so Linschoten stayed on for two years, giving him the opportunity to explore the Azores and later write about it. More significantly, Afhuysen, who had been holed up in Malacca for 14 months on account of wars and tribulations in that city,10 shared with Linschoten his wealth of experience on Malacca and the surrounding islands.

It was thus only in early 1592 that Linschoten returned to Lisbon before finally returning to the Netherlands after an absence of 13 years. There he began compiling his *Itinerario*, selling it to Cornelis Claesz who published it only in 1596.

Linschoten’s return coincided with the liberation and independence of Holland from its Spanish masters in 1594. One of his last epic adventures was his voyage to the Arctic which he made twice, in 1594 and 1595, in search of a northeast passage to Asia. He died on 8 February 1611, having gained international fame for his publication of the *Itinerario* as well as community status as Enkhuizen City’s treasurer.

#### **Linschoten’s Work — An Illustrated Guide**

Linschoten’s famed publication is popularly known as the *Itinerario*, but this is merely the title of the first of its four books. The *Itinerario*, *voyage ofte schipvaert van Jan Huyghen van Linschoten near Oost ofte Portugails Indien*11 is book one, capturing Linschoten’s voyage to the East Indies, with primarily a description of the landscape and life in India plus an additional mention of the history of Malacca, the produce and people of Java and the route to China. The second book gives descriptions of the landscape from Guinea to Angola, with details of the discovery of Madagascar. It is the third book, the *Reysgheshrift van de navigatein der Portugaloysers in Orienten*12 which was instrumental in opening the East Indies to the Dutch and the English as it gives details of sea routes to the region, particularly to Malacca, Java, Sunda, China and Japan. It also gives a description of the West Indies as well as of Brazil. The last book gives highlights of the rents, tolls and profits taken along the journey by their sponsors. 

Interwoven through Linschoten's narrative are parallel texts on the same subject, published as italicised texts. These were interpolations by physician Bernard ten Broecke, also known by his Latin name, Paludanus. His knowledge was derived from his own travels as well as interviews with other sojourners. Native to Holland, he had taken his university degree at Padua and had then journeyed to Syria and Egypt. He took treasures from these travels back to his residence in Enkhuizen and became known for his intriguing collection of oddities. He was recognised for his intellectual prowess so much so that he was given the position of professorship at the University of Leyden in 1591, but did not accept the appointment and chose instead to remain in Enkhuizen. His reputation remains that of having co-authored this famed publication with Linschoten. His contribution to the publication, however, is not considered highly factual or close to reality.
