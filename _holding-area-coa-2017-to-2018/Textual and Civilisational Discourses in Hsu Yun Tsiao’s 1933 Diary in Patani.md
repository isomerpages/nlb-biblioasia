#### **Hsu’s Nanyang Studies: Under the Shadow of Siamese Historiography**
Before co-founding Chinese-language Southeast Asian (Nanyang or South
Seas) studies in Singapore in 1940, the Suzhou-born historian Hsu Yun-
Tsiao (1905–81) sojourned as a teacher at Zhong Hua School (1933–36) in
the Malay-Muslim region of Patani in southern Thailand.1

Known mostly for his academic and editorial work in South Seas Journal
(*Nanyang xuebao*, 1940–), the popular *South Seas Miscellany* (*Nanyang zazhi,*
1946–48) and the children’s magazine *Malayan Youth* (*Malaiya shaonian*,
1946–48), Hsu also led his students from Nanyang University (or Nantah)
on ethnographic trips; promoted translations from Burmese, Thai and
Vietnamese; annotated a play about Zheng He; wrote classical Chinese
poems; compiled volumes on the anti-Japanese war effort by Nanyang
Chinese (1938–45) and the war crimes trial (1946); as well as produced
Southern Chinese language glossaries and Malay-Chinese dictionaries.
Working across media to promote Malayan identities in the postwar era, Hsu gave 15-minute-long radio lectures on local histories, later compiled
into *Collected Writings on Malaya* (*Malaiya congtan*, 1961).

In contrast, Hsu’s early, pre-Singapore years have been not as well known
in Nanyang historiography. Recently digitised by the National Library,
Singapore (NLB) in May 2018, Hsu’s five unpublished diaries (1930–38)
provide rare glimpses into his interwar Nanyang studies in Siam (now
Thailand), which anticipate the geopolitics and scholarly politics of Nanyang
studies in Singapore some 20 years later.2

In 1933, in his most detailed 400-page diary, Hsu noted his anticipation
in receiving publications from Shanghai: “Jinan University’s Bureau of
Nanyang and American Cultural Affairs (*Nanyang Meizhou wenhua shiye
bu*) sent over a huge bundle of the *Nanyang Newsletter* (*Nanyang qingbao*).3
According to the subscription form it costs one baht, payable to Kaiming
Press. I ordered 30 numbers, from vol. 1 number 1 through vol. 2 number
10”. [*Diaries* v.2: 131]. Other interwar Chinese publications on Southeast
Asia, such as *Nanyang Research* (*Nanyang yanjiu*, 1928– ), were managed by
this bureau through key figures such as Liu Shimu, Li Changfu and Yao
Nan, who would later co-found the South Seas Society (1940– ) with Hsu
in Singapore.4 Anxious yet excited by Japan’s state-sponsored study of the
Nanyang (or Nanyo) in the 1920s, these Chinese intellectuals founded the
Jinan Cultural Bureau in 1927.5 By producing original work and translating
Japanese and Western writings on Southeast Asia, the Jinan scholars hoped
to redirect intellectual-political energies from Japan, and foster closer ties to
local Chinese newspapers and journals in Penang, Singapore, Malacca and
Batavia (now Jakarta).

Entering the scene slightly later and based in the Nanyang itself, Hsu
transformed the Western- and Japanese-influenced research of Jinan scholars
by drawing on a variety of Thai, Malay and Burmese sources.6 Hsu arrived
in Patani just after the 1932 Siamese Revolution by the People’s Party
of Siam, which had partially overthrown the monarchy to introduce a
constitution. Hsu witnessed the chaotic waves of royalist counter-revolution
against Bangkok that culminated in the Bowaradej rebellion of October
1933. In 1932, the future Prime Minister Phibul Songkhram forced Chinese
assimilation by reviving the Primary School Act of 1921 and the Private
School Act of 1918, requiring Chinese schools, which were then private
schools, to register with the government, effectively placing them under
state control. The Thai language was also made the compulsory medium of
instruction. Hsu joined and negotiated for the Chinese schools’ education
movement (1933–36), which protested against these changes. By 1930, elite
members from Teochew, Hokkien, Cantonese, Hakka and Hainanese
language groups in Siam had agreed to teach in Mandarin and consolidate
a Chinese national identity.7 Lamenting his students’ lack of proficiency,
Hsu had at times taught Chinese using English and *zhuyin zimu* (Mandarin
phonetic alphabet) [v.2: 234]. But now, Chinese language class time had
been severely curtailed and other courses had to be taught in Thai. Hsu had
to learn Thai and pass a language examination within one-and-a-half years of
arriving in Siam [v.2: 172–73].8

Purveying the Chinese Nationalist Party’s (Kuomintang) curricula of
overseas Chinese education based on the civilisational mission of *Zhonghua
huiguan* (c. 1900), the “umbrella” organisation for Chinese affairs, Hsu lobbied for Chinese autonomy and cultural upkeep against the new
regime’s forced assimilation policies, which reversed prior arrangements
whereby Chinese subjects had been protected by the Siamese monarch.9
In 1936, Hsu left Zhong Hua School and taught English at Bangkok’s
National School of Science and Engineering.10 In 1938, Hsu left for
Singapore after the fascist Phibun, now a Field Marshal, forced Chinese
newspapers and schools – those not already closed by the government or
voluntarily – to shut down nationwide.11

In this section of the essay, I examine the oft-overlooked influence of
modern Siamese historiography on Hsu’s Nanyang studies. In Hsu’s
estimation, the three most important scholars of Nanyang histories were
the French Sinologist Paul Pelliot (1878–1945), Sino-Indian historian
Feng Chengjun (1887–1946) and Prince Damrong Rajanubhab of Siam
(1862–1943).12 The latter, though exiled to Penang after the Siamese People’s
Party coup in 1932, had famously inaugurated the study of modern Thai
history (*prawattisat*) by giving a “nationalist reading of the *phongsawadan*”
(dynastic chronicles).13 “By 1930, Damrong had retired and was leading the
effort to build the collection at Siam’s National Library by accumulating
ephemeral texts”.14 As the “Father of Siam History” [v. 2: 275] and “the royal librarian-in-chief” who played a “crucial role in the establishment of the
Thai territorial state during the late 19th and early 20th centuries”, Damrong
gets Hsu’s stamp of approval:

   *Dafa told me: Thai people call the Head of the Royal Library<br>
   the “Father of Siam History” [บิดาของประวัติศาสตร์สยาม bida<br>
   khong prawatisat siam]; he who happens to be the only historian<br>
   in Thailand.<br>
   大发告余，谓暹人称皇家图书馆主任为暹史之父บิดาของประวัติศาสตร์<br>
   สยาม 蓋暹国惟一之历史学家也*。
	 
Lending a twist to Prince Damrong’s royal-nationalist reading of Siam’s
history was playwright and politician Luang Wichit Wathakan (1898–1962)
who wrote popular histories, plays and propaganda in the early 1930s, even
before he became the chief ideologue for Phibun’s military, ethno-nationalist
wartime rule. Luang Wichit’s version of world history borrowed heavily from
Damrong’s traditional-style chronicles of “drum-and-trumpet history” but
updated them to include the heroic deeds of common men and women in
defending the nation.15 Drawing on German and Italian Fascism16 and their
“militaristic view of the past”, Luang Wichit’s idea of culture (*watthanatham*)
saw Thai subjects as part of a civilised nation (*prathet siwilai*) on equal footing
with Western powers and irrevocably shaped the course of Thai modernity.17

Luang Wichit’s 12-volume bestseller *Prawattisat Sakon* [*Universal History*,
1929–31] impressed Hsu enough for him to translate its sixth and seventh
books, *Prawat Khong Sayam* [*History of Siam*].18 Hsu also published excerpts on the Sino-Thai King Taksin (1734–82) as *Xianluo wang Zheng
Zhao zhuan* (*Biography of the Siamese King Zheng Zhao*, 1936). Zheng
Zhao, the Chinese name of King Taksin (*Daxin*) used by diplomatic
envoys to Qing China, apparently had a Teochew-Chinese father and
a Thai mother.19 In his diary, Hsu notes Luang Wichit’s description of
Taksin’s mythic origins: “thunder shook the house” and “a snake curled
up by the baby’s side”, which his father “took as an unlucky sign and
ordered his servant to throw the baby into the river” [v. 2: 96]. Rescued by
a Siamese warrior, Taksin was sent to a Buddhist monastery and mastered
southern Min, Vietnamese and Indian languages.20 Taksin went on to
serve as a governor and acquired the noble title Phraya Tak. He famously
expelled the Burmese from the fallen Ayutthaya kingdom (1351–1767)
and founded the Thonburi dynasty (1767–82). Taksin’s achievements,
for Luang Wichit, recalled King Naresuan’s (1555–1605) resistance against
Taungoo Burma’s (1510–1599) repeated siege of Ayutthaya. Taksin would
have been a fit specimen for Luang Wichit’s earlier essay, “On Great Men”
(1928), which included “Napoleon, Bismarck, Disraeli, Gladstone, Okubo
Toshimichi (of the Meiji Restoration) and Mussolini”.21

Luang Wichit’s biography on Taksin venerated Siamese ambition and
success. But Hsu’s selective, annotated translation of this act of hero
worship had a different motive. In 1904, the Chinese reformist Liang
Qichao (1873–1929) published a famous, short essay, “Biographies of
China’s Eight Great Colonial Heroes” (*Zhongguo zhimin bada weiren
zhuan*), which espoused the virtues of settler colonialism and puzzled
over the paradox of a large Chinese diaspora that had no formal overseas
colonies.22 Liang named King Taksin as one of the great colonial heroes,
among other southern Chinese traders and bandits who settled as far as
Java and Sumatra. Under the pen name “China’s New Citizen” (*Zhongguo
zhi xinmin*), Liang argued that “Taksin’s accomplishment as a Siamese
king far exceeded the Japanese Yamada Nagamasa’s rule” (1617–30) in Siam’s Nakhon Si Thammarat province, but expressed “sorrow that his
Chinese fellowmen did not know of [Thaksin]”.23 For Liang, the Chinese
nation was constituted by the strengths of its diaspora.24 Even his call for
a Chinese “poetic revolution” in 1899 was based on his favourable view
of European colonial expansion as a solution for the problems of land
exhaustion and overproduction.25 When situated in this tradition, Hsu’s
translation of Luang Wichit’s Taksin reminds its readers, ironically, of
the open secret of a Chinese bloodline of Siamese monarchs – even those
from the later Rattanakosin period (1782–1932) who suppressed Taksin’s
legacy to define their rule – and of the nationalist writer himself, Luang
Wichit (whose given name was Kim Liang); Luang denied his Chinese
heritage all his life. Whether hesitant to engage in anti-imperialist critique,
or performing one based on ethnic injury, Hsu saw an appeal in ethnonationalist
Thai histories that otherwise would affront him – or at least,
the need to unearth a history of peaceful relations between Siam and
China appealed to him. The figure of Taksin becomes a perverse form of
what Benedict Anderson calls nationalism’s “unbound seriality”.26

I further suggest that the popular or “anecdotal histories” (*shihua*) that
Hsu often published in postwar Singapore, with their emphasis on writing
a people’s history, were inspired by Luang Wichit’s examples rather than
by Chinese “literary biographies” in the style of Sima Qian’s *Shiji* [*Records
of the Grand Historian*, c. 94 BC]. Hsu prided himself on rectifying
place-name mistakes in classical Chinese accounts of maritime geography,
for example, “Dani” was actually Pattani, not Borneo; “Dandan” was
Kelantan; “Chitu” was Songkhla.27 Hsu’s biographer Lew Bon Hui (Liao
Wenhui) traces Hsu’s textual analyses to the late-Qing scientific mode of “evidential learning” (*kaozheng*) or Han learning (*Hanxue*), which replaced
earlier cosmological readings of classical texts with linguistic scrutiny,
and suggests that this style of historical writing is found in Hsu’s primary
school textbooks on Malayan history.28 Others prefer to call Hsu’s method
one of “empiricism” (*shizheng*), based on models of Western social science
that Nanyang historians, such as Liu Shimu, encountered when studying
in Japan.29 Hsu remained aloof from revisionist trends in modern Chinese
history such as that of Liang Qichao’s “New Historiography” (*xin shixue*),
which recommended a causal (or evolutionary) approach focused on
“popular movements and social life” attuned to “the world, nations, and
peoples” and its “broader geographical and ethnic framework”, to replace
the “reign-by-reign approach” of “Han China and its dynastic regimes”.30
Hsu hardly commented on the relationship between history and
narrative, nation and ethnicity, but he had an implicit relation to Chinese
scholarship about “frontier history” (*bianjiangshi*) and “China-foreign
communication history (*Zhongwai jiaotongshi*).31

When he introduced his compiled lectures on Malaya, Nanyang, Annam
and *Sejarah Melayu* (*Malay Annals*) at Nanyang University and Ngee Ann
Institution, Hsu said that history writing “required an objective method” –
distortions to fact arose due to external forces rather than questions intrinsic
to history writing: “history was written in a subjective manner because
historians were limited by their environment, and oppressed by institution
and kings” and that “history as a new subject examines the truth of historical
facts – even if it cannot become a science, its methods of study ought to be
scientific”.32 For Hsu, the three schools of history were classical, scientific When he introduced his compiled lectures on Malaya, Nanyang, Annam
and Sejarah Melayu (Malay Annals) at Nanyang University and Ngee Ann
Institution, Hsu said that history writing “required an objective method” –
distortions to fact arose due to external forces rather than questions intrinsic
to history writing: “history was written in a subjective manner because
historians were limited by their environment, and oppressed by institution
and kings” and that “history as a new subject examines the truth of historical
facts – even if it cannot become a science, its methods of study ought to be
scientific”.32 For Hsu, the three schools of history were classical, scientific task of history writing is the collection and verification of minutiae, and not
their interpretation. It is no wonder that Hsu was more concerned about
dispelling a rumour started by a French missionary in Thonburi – and
seized upon by later rulers – that Taksin went “insane” and was unfit to
govern because of his ascetic Buddhist practices; or as Luang Wichit tells it,
Taksin’s downfall was caused by his two wives.34

The study of Taksin had already become an industry in China when
Hsu’s translation of Luang Wichit’s text appeared in Shanghai in 1936.
Besides Liang’s influential essay, Yi Benxi’s (pen name *Xinhuang zhengyin*)
“Brief History of Overseas Chinese in the South Seas” (*Nanyang huaqiao
shilüe*, 1910) gave a nationalist view of King Taksin and listed him as
one of 11 accomplished “builders” overseas. In the late 1930s, the next
generation of Taksin scholars such as Chen Yutai and Hsu Yun-Tsiao
clarified the chronology of his reign, and more importantly, published
their essays in the Nanyang, namely in *Zhongyuan bao*’s academic journal
*Zhongyuan Monthly* (*Zhongyuan yuekan*) and its supplement *Taiguo yanjiu*.
Remarkably, the latter publication was founded in September 1939, a
few months after Siam became Thailand, and in the wake of Phibun’s
crackdown on Chinese publications.
