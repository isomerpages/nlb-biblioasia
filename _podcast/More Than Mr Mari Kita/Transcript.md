description: Pak Zubir Said (1907–87) gave Singapore its national anthem,
  “Majulah Singapura”, and its official Children’s Day song, “Semoga Bahagia”.
  Working with theatre company Wild Rice, musical director Julian Wong put
  together a critically acclaimed production on the life of Pak Zubir that mixed
  history, music and memory in a moving show that led to sold out performances
  in 2022 and 2024. In this episode, Julian tells us the challenges of
  researching and performing those songs, and reveals if he’s a Swiftie.
