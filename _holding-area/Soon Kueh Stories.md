#### **Episode summary** ####
In the 1950s, Abbess Yang Yincai of Hai Inn See, a temple in Choa Chu Kang, discovered that bamboo plants grew particularly well in the temple grounds and led the effort to make _soon kueh_ regularly. The _kueh_ became so popular that it was sold at the nearby coffeeshop, at 5 cents apiece, where it quickly became an essential breakfast item for residents.

Researcher Kelvin Tan explores how Chinese Buddhist women like her shaped the vegetarian food landscape in Singapore as he recreates this much beloved recipe.

#### **Recipes**
Although Kelvin followed the temple’s recipe closely, he added radish and black fungus to the filling, which are popular in _soon kueh_ recipes today. For the dough skin, he added 20 g of glutinous rice flour and used smaller quantities of wheat starch and tapioca flour (300 g and 170 g respectively).

In the old days when rice flour was not as readily available, the nuns at Hai Inn See used a stone mortar and pestle to grind rice into rice milk to make the dough skin. Leaves from _simpoh air (Dillenia suffruticosa_), a native plant, were used to pack the _kueh_ for takeaways.
