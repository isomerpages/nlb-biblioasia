#### Barbara Kerr Sharpshooter, School Principal, Girl Guide Extraordinaire 
By Nick Aplin

In early 20th-century Singapore, there were not many occasions when a woman was expected to stand her ground against men in a representative international sporting event. There was, however, one notable exception: when a 26-year-old school principal stunned her male rivals, not in golf or tennis, but in rifle shooting.

The school principal was none other than Barbara Kerr, principal of the Singapore Chinese Girls’ School (SCGS). The occasion for her amazing display of “markswomanship” was the 25th Interport Rifle Match in 1914 between the teams from Singapore, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Penang.[^1 ]

This was also the first time that women were allowed to participate in the match; prior to 1914, this had been an exclusively male preserve. What made the competition even more historic is that Kerr was the only woman on the Singapore team, and most likely the other teams as well. 

#### **A Dramatic Win**
The names of the team representing Singapore – Barbara Kerr being one of them and the sole woman – were finalised only in early May 1914. There were some ground rules for the Interport Rifle Match. The match “shall be fired on any date between 15th April and 31st May (inclusive) in each year”, and “[e]ach port shall shoot on its own or any recognised range in the neighbourhood”.[^2]

Comprising 12 competitors per team, each person had to shoot the target from 200 yards (183 m), 500 yards (457 m) and 600 yards (549 m), and the scores added up. Each team would independently and accurately record and report its scores, and send these by telegraph to the other teams. There were officials at each venue to record and verify the scores: “three superintending officers or umpires, two of whom shall be at the butts [an earthen bank used to support a target for shooting] and one at the firing point throughout the shooting”.[^3]

Only the 10 best scores from each team were taken into account. The Singapore team consisted of R.W. Chater; Ferguson Davie; R.E. de Silva; J. Flanagan; W.L. Kemp; Barbara Kerr; D.W. Moss; Gunner Neubronner; R.G. Pash; E.J. Potter; Song Ong Siang; and Tan Chow Kim.[^4]

Singapore’s match took place on 23 May 1914 at Balestier Rifle Range, on the north side of Balestier Road. It was a day “almost perfect for firing”. “There was practically no breeze,” reported the _Malaya Tribune_, “and the few misty clouds, tempered the glare, making a light hard to be bettered for such an affair”.[^5]

Kerr had a poor start but recovered in a spectacular way to score a total of 93 points for Singapore, putting her in sixth position. The _Malaya Tribune_ wrote:

Miss Kerr was most heartily congratulated on her strong finish, and she well deserved it. Coming from the 200 yds. position a bad fire of 27, she did not become disheartened in the least, and secured 32 from the 500 distance. The last firing began at 4.35 from the 600 yards mound, and Miss Kerr rose a few minutes later after making the highest score of any of the competitors from that distance – 34, bringing her name up to 6th on the score sheet.[^6]

|Singapore Team|200 yards|500 yards|600 yards|Total
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
|R.E. de Silva|31|34|33|98|
|Lt. W. L. Kemp|33|33|32|98|
|Sapper J. Flanagan|32|34|30|96|
|C. Sergeant-Major Chater|31|32|32|95|
|Gunner Neubronner|31|35|29|95|
|Miss Barbara Kerr|27|32|34|93|
|Sapper E.J. Potter|28|34|31|93|
|Sergeant Tan Chow Kim|32|31|30|93|
|Lt. Song Ong Siang|28|32|31|91|
|Sapper R. Pash|29|29|32|90|
||302|326|314|942|

The final score for Singapore was 942, which tied it with Shanghai. One point less from Kerr and Shanghai would have won the competition. One of her teammates, Song Ong Siang, acknowledged her contributions to the team effort: 

The novel feature in the match was the inclusion in the Singapore team of a lady, Miss Kerr (the well-known and popular vocalist, then Principal of the Singapore Chinese Girls’ School, and now Mrs Thomas). By her coolness and steady shooting at the longer ranges, she finished by taking sixth place with a score of 93.[^7]

When asked by a _Malaya Tribune_ reporter if nerves had affected her score after the 200 yards round, Kerr replied that she had been very nervous then. She added, “I did not care after that, as I was out of it.”[^8] Kerr had left her stamp on the history of rifle shooting in Singapore.

#### **Early Life and Achievements**
Barbara Hume Christie Kerr was born on 19 December 1887 near Dockhead Street, Saltcoats, Ayrshire, in Scotland. In 1898, 11-year-old Barbara moved to Singapore with her father David Kerr, a marine engineer, together with her mother, who was also known as Barbara Kerr, and her 13-year-old sister, Mary Gibson Kerr.

The two Kerr sisters began their studies at Raffles Girls’ School (RGS) in 1899. Kerr was in Standard IV, while her elder sister Mary was in Standard VI. Both received a prize at the end of that school year – Kerr for Reading and her sister for English History.[^9]

In 1900, David Kerr left Singapore in either October or November to take up a posting in Bangkok as engineer for the Poh Chin Soo rice mills. Tragically he died of a stroke on 21 November.[^10] At the time, Barbara Kerr and her two daughters resided at 8 Devonshire Road. In 1903, the family moved to “Leonie House” (14 Grange Road), on Leonie Hill, as proprietors.[^11]

Kerr continued to do well academically at RGS. In 1902, when she was in Standard VII, she won the prize for Sacred History.[^12] The following year, she became head girl.[^13] In February 1905, as a senior in the Special Class, Kerr collected prizes for Composition and French.[^14] She was also one of three seniors at RGS who took the Cambridge Local Examinations and passed.[^15] At the prizegiving ceremony in May 1905, Kerr was designated “First Girl”.[^16]

Beyond her academic achievements, Kerr was a soprano of considerable repute. She made public appearances in charity concerts, notably at a concert held at the Tanglin Club for the benefit of St Mary’s Home for Orphans in November 1906.[^17] Kerr also played tennis and was a handicap golfer. However, it was in rifle shooting that she made her mark.

On the professional front, Kerr was the principal of SCGS from 1912 to 1916, and again from 1918 to 1920 after her marriage. She also made significant contributions to the Girl Guide movement, and was District Commissioner for Singapore from 1927 to 1935. Between 1934 and 1941, she was Commissioner for Malay Guides and Brownies, Girl Guides Association, Malaya.[^18]

Kerr was also known for her work as honorary secretary of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Child Welfare Society.[^19]

In 1916, she married Leslie Arding Thomas, who would be appointed Chief Police Officer of Singapore in 1939. After her marriage, she became known as Mrs L.A. Thomas.[^20]
