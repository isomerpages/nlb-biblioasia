**About**:	The reading club is committed to promoting reading culture and nurturing lifelong reading habits amongst its members. The club serves as a vibrant platform for healthy cultural leisure activities, fostering meaningful communication and interaction amongst participants. Each book discussion session is carefully structured to deepen participants' understanding and appreciation of literary works through collaborative dialogue, thoughtful sharing, and dynamic interaction. These discussions primarily focus on works by local authors, celebrating and exploring the richness of regional literature, whilst also extending to encompass significant overseas literary works that broaden members' global literary perspectives.
