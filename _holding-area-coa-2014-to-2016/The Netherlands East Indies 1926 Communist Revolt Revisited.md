   *[…] In the Dutch East Indies, the demeanour of the native<br>
   towards the European has passed by successive stages from an almost<br>
   abject deference to a thinly veiled hostility. The Dutch colonists<br>
   are accordingly anxious and restive about the ultimate outcome<br>
   of the present “ethical” policy.1 Knowledge of the natives’ history<br>
   encourages the colonists in the view that the extreme plasticity of the<br>
   native character renders outside influences particularly powerful<br>
   in Java, and that it will prove disastrous if the Government stands<br>
weakly aside in the presence of subversive agitation.*2

#### **Introduction**

On 7 October 1926, *The Singapore Free Press* (SFP), a popular Englishlanguage
newspaper in the Straits Settlements, reprinted a long opinion piece
from London’s *The Times*. Entitled “Dutch Policy in Java: Propaganda and
the Native”, the article discussed the ongoing “communist disturbances” in
the nearby Netherlands East Indies (NEI ). A keen observer, the anonymous
author reviewed in great detail the history of the Archipelago and analysed
various immigrant groups in colonial society at that time. He pointed out
that people in the NEI were open to foreign influences, which provided
radical movements – such as Chinese anti-imperialism and Arabian
Islamicism – with fertile grounds on which to grow.

As the Dutch gradually lost their prestige in the natives’ eyes by “perpetrating
acts of injustice and, often, uncontrolled violence”, extremist ideologies such
as communism gained significant support from the indigenous population.3
The author indicated that communist propagandists had successfully worked
their way into schools, trade unions, government departments and military
units. With the growing impudence of the local press and the increase in
disruptive activities, it was evident that extremism had experienced a rapid
upsurge in recent years. The article ended by exhorting the Dutch to take
sterner measures to curb this dangerous communist agitation.4

Printed alongside advertisements on the newspaper’s page six, the opinion
piece probably did not receive the attention it deserved despite its persuasive
analysis and alarmist warnings. A month later, a major communist revolt
broke out in Batavia, followed by similar uprisings in Bantam and West
Sumatra. How could the writer have made such an accurate prediction a
month in advance while the Dutch colonial administration seemed caught
unprepared when the uprising happened? Why did the SFP print the article,
or rather, why did political issues in the NEI even matter to newspaper
readers in British Malaya?

Through NewspaperSG , a digital newspaper database developed and
managed by the National Library Board (NL B) of Singapore, this paper aims to add more nuanced views to the understanding of the 1926/27
communist insurrections in the NEI , especially their broader impact on
Malaya. This paper argues that partly because of the extensive public
discussions surrounding the NEI insurrections, as well as important lessons
learned from their Dutch counterparts, the British administration’s anticommunist
measures predated the formal establishment of the Malayan
Communist Party (MCP) in 1930. As a result of the British authorities’
effective surveillance and policing work, the MCP struggled for its survival
from its inception and never had a real chance to pose serious threats to the
colonial regime before World War II (WWII ).

A few scholars have studied the history of early communist movements
in the NEI and British Malaya.5 Ruth McVey’s *The Rise of Indonesian
Communism* (1965) is by far the most comprehensive account of the origins
of the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI ) until its disintegration in 1927.
Using both Dutch and Indonesian materials, McVey has produced a very
detailed analysis of the 1926/27 revolts and the government’s systematic
suppression of them. The year 1927 is a convenient ending point in McVey’s
narrative because the PKI was forced underground and would not play a
significant role in Indonesian politics until many years later. Yong Ching
Fatt’s *The Origins of Malayan Communism* (1997) investigates the movement
on the British side of the Malacca Straits. Using both English and Chinese
sources, Yong traces the Chinese roots of the early communist organisations
in Malaya. Both McVey and Yong briefly mention the communist
movements of the “other side” in their respective works.

Cheah Boon Kheng (1992) took an important step forward by conducting
preliminary research into the links between the two movements. Besides
an essay-length summary of these connections, Cheah also reproduced a
number of documents that illustrate the MCP’s Indonesian connections
in the early years of the organisation’s establishment (1930), which could
serve as important signposts for further exploration. Despite his interesting
findings regarding the communists’ networks across the British and Dutch
colonies, Cheah’s work does not grapple with the wider socio-political
impacts of these early movements beyond the limited connections of
individuals, which left a gap for further studies.

Many historians consider the PKI uprisings as important precursors of
Indonesia’s nationalist movement, which ultimately led to the country’s
independence.6 When it comes to the actual course of events, however,
existing narratives tend to describe the abortive revolts as ill-prepared, poorly
organised and easily suppressed – and consequently, of limited impact in
shaking the foundation of the Dutch colonial regime.7 It is also commonly
understood that in the aftermath of the rebellions, Dutch authorities dealt
a crushing blow to the PKI and its associated organisations by carrying out
large-scale arrests, imprisonments, executions and banishments. Beyond
these facts, however, very little attention has been paid to the deeper
meanings that the revolt revealed. As the following sections will demonstrate,
the movement created enormous anxiety in the NEI , which forced the Dutch
colonial government to act with a strong hand. Moreover, with frequent
exchanges of information and personnel across the Malacca Straits, the NEI
uprisings also generated considerable uneasiness in British Malaya.
