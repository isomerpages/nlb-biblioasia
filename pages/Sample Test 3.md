<h2>Growing Food in a Garden City</h2>
<p>By Fiona Williamson and Joshua Goh</p>
<p>In June 2020, the National Parks Board (NParks) launched Gardening with
Edibles, an initiative that saw the distribution of nearly 460,000 seed
packs to interested households. Each pack contained approximately 1,000
vegetable seeds, allowing Singaporeans to grow a few rounds of crops ranging
from tomatoes to leafy vegetables like <em>kalian</em>.<a href="#_ftn1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[1]</a> The initiative’s
main purpose was to drive home the importance of food security as part
of a wider national campaign, Our Singapore Food Story.<a href="#_ftn2" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[2]</a>
</p>
<p>Due to Singapore’s heavy reliance on imported food, most locals rarely
have a hand in producing the food they eat. In 2020, fewer than 3,100 Singapore
residents (or 0.14 percent of the labour force) were involved in industries
such as agriculture and fishing.<a href="#_ftn3" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[3]</a> Gardening with Edibles bridges this wide disconnect
between farm and table by providing Singaporeans with the experience of
growing their own food.</p>
<p>Edible gardening is not a recent phenomenon in Singapore; Gardening with
Edibles was preceded by the Grow More Food campaigns. These initiatives
and practices of edible gardening in modern Singapore emerged from a confluence
of food security concerns and planning ideals from the Garden City Movement
in Britain and demonstrate just how deeply rooted edible gardening is in
the Singapore Story.</p>

<h4><strong>Edible Gardens for Health and Wellbeing</strong></h4>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>With the advent of a <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Garden City Movement </a>in
the late 1800s, the connection between gardens and urban wellbeing was
widely touted by social improvers and town planners in Britain and the
U.S. In Britain, for example, Edwin Chadwick and Benjamin Ward Richardson
had both proposed models for healthy cities wherein gardens played significant
roles in urban wellbeing.</p>
<p>Richardson’s model city narrative <em>Hygeia</em> (1876) argued that cities
must have tree-lined boulevards and green spaces and homes should be “surrounded
with garden space, [to] add not only to the beauty but to the healthiness
of the city”.<a href="#_ftn4" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>[4]</u></a> One
of the most influential writers of the late 19th century was Ebenezer Howard,
whose <em>Garden Cities of Tomorrow</em> (1898, reprinted 1902) birthed the
concept of the garden city “to raise the standard of health and comfort
of all true workers of whatever grade – the means by which these objects
are to be achieved being a healthy, natural, and economic combination of
town and country life”.<a href="#_ftn5" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>[5]</u></a>
</p>
<p>Such ideas eventually found their way into official circles in Singapore
through trans-imperial knowledge networks. In the 1910s and 1920s, a series
of imperial health conferences drew connections between planning, housing
and health, and linked ideas of social justice amid the popularity of new
labour movements to access to green, healthy space and food. These concerns
intensified at the outbreak of war in 1914, when many people failed to
pass the basic health requirements to enter military service, probably
the first time such a mass health screening had taken place.<a href="#_ftn6" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>[6]</u></a>
</p>
<p>While these urban planning movements did not directly address edible gardens,
some of Singapore’s health institutions did set up kitchen gardens to improve
patient wellbeing. In 1917, for example, an institution for the mentally
ill had created a kitchen garden. By 1918, “excellent fresh vegetables
were available … aggregating 10,534 pounds for the staff and ‘inmates’
grown by the patients themselves”, reported the<em> Singapore Free Press</em>.
<a href="#_ftn7" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>[7]</u> 
</a>Edible gardens had been incorporated into Singapore’s hospitals long before
Khoo Teck Puat Hospital developed its “A garden in a hospital” concept.
<a href="#_ftn8" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>[8]</u>
</a>
</p>
<h4><strong>Edible Gardens for Food Security</strong></h4>
<p>At the same time, food security concerns provided further impetus for
colonial authorities to promote edible gardening as a means of ensuring
the wellbeing of working-class families. This was not a new idea as there
had been edible gardens in British cities since the late 1700s. Local governments
rented out small plots of land to urban dwellers who wanted, or needed,
to grow their own food, rather than buy it. <a href="#_ftn9" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[9]</a> Such allotments proved to be an enduring aspect of
working-class British culture all the way through the 20th century.<a href="#_ftn2" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[2]</a>
</p>
<p>From the 1910s, there had been growing international concern that agricultural
output would not match population growth. The outbreak of the First World
War in 1914 demonstrated that when global supply lines were severely disrupted
for long periods, countries overly reliant on imported goods struggled
to be self-sustainable. It was remarked in 1918 how “[t]he cost of a few
sprigs of ‘chukup manis’, a few scraggy beans, or a cucumber or two, is
astonishing in Singapore … and altogether the supply of local grown foods
is altogether inadequate”.<a href="#_ftn3" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[3]</a>
</p>
<p>The local situation had been compounded by the gradual erosion of market
gardening in Singapore, traditionally undertaken in the 19th century by
many Chinese communities to the east of the town centre, around Rochor
through Bendemeer.<a href="#_ftn4" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[4]</a> By 1919, an impending rice shortage across Malaya
meant that plantation workers were encouraged to “get busy and cultivate
gardens, planting food stuffs such as ragi [finger millet], yams and maize
to be eaten instead of rice”.<a href="#_ftn5" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[5]</a>
