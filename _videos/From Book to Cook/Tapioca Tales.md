#### **Episode summary** ####
Because there was a rice shortage during the Japanese Occupation, people ate sweet potato and tapioca instead. Lee Geok Boi shows us what the human imagination is capable of by taking the humble tapioca and turning into two delicious dishes, using only ingredients that were available in Japanese-occupied Singapore.

#### **Recipes**
Geok Boi's recipes are inspired by tapioca noodles that were sold during wartime, and memories of her father's tapioca dessert.
