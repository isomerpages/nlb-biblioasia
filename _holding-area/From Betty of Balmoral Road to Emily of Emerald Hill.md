#### A study of early drafts of Emily of Emerald Hill reveals fascinating choices and paths not taken.
By Eriko Ogihara-Schuck

Over the last four decades, few Singaporean plays have occupied the imagination as much as Stella Kon’s _Emily of Emerald Hill_. Possibly the most frequently staged play in Singapore, the powerful script and the notable performances of the likes of Margaret Chan, Neo Swee Lin, Karen Tan, Laura Kee, Ivan Heng and others have inspired audiences to think about Peranakan culture and its place in the evolution of Singapore society.

While all this would suggest that the 90-minute monodrama is very well known, there are numerous aspects of Emily that few people are familiar with. Who knows, for example, that Kon had, at one point, planned to title the play Betty of Balmoral Road? 

In an early version of the play, Kon also had a very different motivation in mind for a key moment, a moment that would cause Emily’s world to collapse. However, she decided to rewrite that scene to avoid being too clichéd. Perhaps more importantly, Kon also added another event into the play to allow Emily to redeem herself in the eyes of the audience, a scene that did not exist in an early draft.

And while very much a Singaporean story – Emily Gan is, after all, a Peranakan matriarch living in the Peranakan enclave of Emerald Hill in Singapore – the play also owes much to Singapore’s northern neighbour. Like many Singaporeans, Emily has many links with Malaysia: playwright Stella Kon was living in Ipoh when she began writing the play, and indeed, Emily first debuted in Malaysia.

The first ever performance of the play took place in 1984 in Seremban, Negri Sembilan. That production by the Five Arts Centre was directed by Malaysian teacher, theatre director and playwright Chin San Sooi with Leow Puay Tin as the first Emily.[^1] The play became so beloved across the Causeway that Pearlly Chua, who first began performing as Emily in 1990, has done so hundreds of times over the last three decades.

#### **Beginnings in Ipoh**

Kon, who is Peranakan, spent her formative years in Emerald Hill Road and had been exposed to theatre at an early age. She was inspired by her mother, Rosie Lim Guat Kheng, who was an amateur actress, and Kon’s theatre-loving father Lim Kok Ann.[^2] While studying at the University of Singapore (now National University of Singapore), Kon wrote a short play titled Birds of a Feather in 1966 which was staged by the university’s students on an exchange trip to France.

Following her marriage and move to Ipoh in 1967, Kon began writing longer plays. In 1971, her double-bill of two science-fiction plays, A Breeding Pair, was produced by the Ipoh Players, the resident theatre company of Ipoh’s Anglo Chinese School.[^3] Its director was Chin San Sooi. 

Kon first began writing Emily of Emerald Hill in Ipoh in 1982, and completed it in Britain when she moved there for the education of her two sons. The idea for the play originally came from Ong Su-Ming, one of the leaders of the school’s theatre company. On hearing Kon lament that the plays which had earlier won her the first prize at the Singapore Playwriting Competition had not yet been staged in Singapore because they needed a large cast, Ong suggested that she write plays with a single character.[^4]

Ong told Kon about the American playwright William Luce’s one-woman play, The Belle of Amherst (1976), based on the life of 19th-century poet Emily Dickinson.[^5] Ong had watched this play in Boston and advised Kon to write a one-woman play about Ong’s grandmother.[^6]
