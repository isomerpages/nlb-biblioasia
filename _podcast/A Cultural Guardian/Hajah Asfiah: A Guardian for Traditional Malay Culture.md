<p>A tireless steward of Malay culture, Hajah Asfiah worked all her life
to preserve and pass on Malay crafts. When she was just 10, she began teaching
embroidery and flower arrangement in school. Later in life, she was a <em>mak andam</em> (wedding
attendant) for more than 20 years and worked with more than 1,000 brides.
At age 65, she got her cookbook <em>Hidangan Warisan Kita</em> (Our Heritage
Dishes; 1986) published by Times Books International; it was the publisher’s
first cookbook, written in Malay by a Malay person. The book had recipes
for dishes that have since become extinct. Sadly, she died a year later,
but thanks to the book she wrote and the many courses she taught, her memory
lives on.
