#### **INTRODUCTION**
In historical studies of Malaysia and Singapore, the British colonial practice
of “divide and rule” in its governing of ethnic communities is a prominent
feature.1 Race relations – then and now – are often viewed in light of how
the British controlled and manipulated Asian communities. The persistence of such concepts and practices2 has implanted the false impression that early
Singaporean communities lived in separate spheres and did not interact
in any meaningful way.3 Except for certain Peranakan communities that
predate British colonialism, there is little evidence in current scholarly
research to show that consistent interaction, friendships or intermarriages
took place in the first few decades following 1819. Even left-leaning analysts
such as J. S. Furnivall, utilising the idea of the “plural society”, have claimed
that interracial colonies were disadvantaged because society was broken into
segregated segments who lived “side by side, yet without mingling”.4

To counter these misconceptions, this paper examines new evidence of
early inter-ethnic relations within a new emerging community, starting
in the first half of the 19th century. One of the premises of this study is
that multiracial interaction was rather extraordinary in the context of
the prevailing colonial framework of society and labour, in which British
administrators intentionally manufactured social, economic and political
differences between communities.5 For example, under colonialism, the
British cultivated a political hegemony which strongly implied their social,
cultural and political “superiority” and compared this to “inferior” races,
thus justifying their role as colonial masters. They often listed hierarchies
of races delineating industriousness versus laziness, entrepreneurial abilities and even cultural traits they deemed desirable, along purely racial lines. The contemporary notion of the cultural superiority of the different Chinese ethnic groups, most of whom were deemed more industrious than the “lazy” Malay races, originates from this period.

This preoccupation with “race” and notions of superiority, according to current historical research covering the Malay Archipelago, did not exist prior to British colonialism. Charles Hirschman claims “racial division” simply did not exist before that, while Collin Abraham claims that considerable harmony existed between the different groups and this was only upset with the arrival of the British. Wang Gungwu has stated that multicultural or multiethnic-type society was an integral part of the “local reality” prior to the arrival of the British.6 7

This paper examines the early growth of the Roman Catholic community in Singapore, which began in earnest in 1833.8 While most other communities at this time were bound by some degree of clan affiliation, ethnic identity or language, the Roman Catholic community was different. From its early days, it was an amalgam of people from different backgrounds. It is possible that divisions did exist, but there were also more opportunities to overcome them than previously recognised. In effect, this community predates modern concepts of multicultural and multiracial Singapore by at least a century.

The data used in this study comes mostly from church records rather than
government records, as colonial governments largely ignored the registration
of Asian communities. These communities were seen merely as a source
of cheap labour,9 therefore not warranting recording in official statistics,
except when it impacted governance and control. Consequently, this study
draws its data from contemporary accounts, oral interviews, individual
entries in church-based birth, marriage and death registers, as well as
newspaper reports.

#### **The Establishment of the Roman Catholic Church in Singapore**
The population of early colonial Singapore comprised three major racial
groupings – Malay, Chinese and Indian – alongside several smaller
communities. In the period immediately after 1819, the island was
dominated by various Malay communities – mainly fishermen, boatmen
and farmers. This included the Bugis, who dominated shipping and trade
between Singapore and the Celebes region, importing a variety of spices,
coffee and gold dust. By 1821, the population of the island was estimated
at 4,727 persons, which included 2,851 Malays, 1,159 Chinese and 29
Europeans.10 The following year, South Indians began arriving. Within a
few years, a large number of Chinese immigrants arriving from various parts
of China’s Guangdong province saw them become the largest racial group.
There were also a number of Peranakan Chinese arriving from around
the region who were largely brokers, shopkeepers and general merchants.
The newer Chinese arrivals – at this stage mostly “Fokiens” (probably
Teochews)11 – were more involved in local industry.12, 13

Christianity arrived in the Malay Archipelago with the Portuguese invasion
of Melaka in 1511. However, the religion they brought with them had little long-term effect on local populations in the region. Consequently, it remained within the limited confines of its small community of mixed Malay-Portuguese “Kristang” descendants in Melaka. It took several centuries before a new wave of Christian evangelisation became apparent with the arrival of British interests, and then generally with the arrival of non-Muslim immigrants from the late 1700s. In 1781, with the help of the Sultan of Kedah, French Roman Catholic missionaries set up a station in Kedah, where they oversaw a group of refugee Roman Catholics from Siam.14 Following the British occupation of Penang island in 1786, this parish moved to the new island outpost. By the early 19th century, the Roman Catholic church was the largest Christian denomination in the Malay Archipelago.15

With the establishment of a British trading post on the island of Singapore in February 1819, French priest Reverend Imbert visited in 1822 and reported to the Bishop of Siam that the island had 12 or 13 Roman Catholics who lived “wretched” lives.16 By 1832, French missionaries had formed a permanent base in Singapore with Reverend Jean-Baptiste Boucho (later Bishop) and Padre Anselmo Yegros,17 after they were granted rent-free land by the British colonial government on Bras Basah Road for the purpose of worship. Within a year, the first Roman Catholic chapel was consecrated on 5 May 1833, on the site of the former St Joseph’s Institution (today the Singapore Art Museum). This small chapel measured a modest 18.3 metres by 9 metres.18

Between 1832 and 1839, the congregation grew relatively quickly, picking up speed from 1842, when inroads were made with the conversion of large numbers of China-born Teochew settlers. With steady growth came the
need to expand beyond the little chapel, and so by 1841 fundraising for a
proper church began. The Church of the Good Shepherd (now Cathedral)
building was completed six years later in 1847.19
