description: In 1952, four Singapore artists – Chen Chong Swee, Chen Wen Hsi,
  Cheong Soo Pieng and Liu Kang – travelled to Java and Bali in search of
  artistic inspiration. The following year, they put up an exhibition showcasing
  art they had produced from the trip, an exhibition often hailed by art
  historians as a milestone in Singapore art history. Yet much of the trip has
  been shrouded in mystery, until Gretchen Liu, the daughter-in-law of Liu Kang,
  discovered Liu Kang's archives and photographs from the trip. She tells us how
  the trip came together, what the artists did in Java and Bali, and what the
  trip meant to them as artists.
