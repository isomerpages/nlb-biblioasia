#### **The Singapore Youth Orchestra’s practice of commissioning and performing the works of local composers was instrumental in the growth of Singapore music.**
By Vivien Goh

When the Singapore Youth Orchestra (SYO) was formed in 1980, part of its mission was to be a feeder to the Singapore Symphony Orchestra which had been set up the year before. However, in addition to nurturing young musicians, the orchestra’s other major contribution to Singapore was to feature the works of local composers. The founding chairman of the board of SYO, Bernard Tan, noted that the intention of the orchestra was to “show our support for Singaporean composers and to build up a body of Singapore works. No other music group, as far as I know, was doing this at the time.” This allowed Singapore composers to get their works performed while also exposing SYO members to local composers.[^1]

“I would like to think that our policy acted as a strong catalyst for Singapore composers to write orchestra works, and also served as an important showcase for them,” he added. “It also encouraged other music groups to perform the works of Singapore composers.”[^2]

During its first decade, under SYO’s founding music director and resident conductor Vivien Goh, a total of seven works were commissioned from local composers and one by the American John Sharpley. The new local works were “Dance Suite” by Leong Yoon Pin (premiered in 1982); “Variations on Dayong Sampan” by Phoon Yew Tien (premiered in 1985); “Stasis” by Tsao Chieh (premiered in 1988); “Fanfare for Joy” by Leong Yoon Pin (premiered in 1986); “Ascent” by Yan Yin Wing (premiered in 1987); “Symphony No. 1” by Bernard Tan (premiered in 1990); and “Salute to My Homeland” by Lim Chin Tiong (premiered in 1987). In 1985, John De Souza was commissioned to write an orchestral arrangement for his composition “Undaunted” that had originally been composed earlier that year. The SYO performed “Undaunted” and his 1980 composition “Sentosa” in 1985. In addition, the SYO also featured the works of American composers who resided in Singapore: David Campbell’s “Singapore Suite” (premiered in 1986) and Sharpley’s “Sojurn” (commissioned in 1988). Three commissioned works were taken on tour: “Dance Suite” to Rome, “Variations of Dayong Sampan” to Lancashire and London, and “Stasis” to Perth.

While the objective of supporting local composers was noble, the efforts were not always appreciated at the time, ironically by the musicians. SYO’s Goh recalled that the musicians usually “approached new compositions with feelings bordering on distaste. Since they often had to struggle with poor \[hand-written\] manuscripts, copyists’ errors, last minute changes by composers and submissions by composers two weeks before performance date, this is not surprising. To top all this, nobody knew what it was going to sound like at first reading. Sometimes even the composers were surprised by what they heard.”[^3]

Composers were told to temper the technical difficulties of their compositions considering the SYO’s young musicians, but some still “\[gave\] free rein to their imaginations. Once unleashed, the occasional result was music which was unlike anything the young musicians had ever played in their lives.”[^4]

From the 1990s to 2011, the SYO continued to commission new works by composers such as Tsao Chieh (“Prelude”, “Fugue” and “Fugato”, 1992), Leong Yoon Pin (“Metamorphosis”, 1993), Er Yenn Chwen (“Three Sketches for Choral and Orchestra”, 1994; “Opening Hearts for Choral and Orchestra”, 2002), Joyce Bee Tuan Koh (“Above Dancing Waters”, 1996), Howard John (“Symphonic Variations on Westron Wynde”, 1997), Kelly Tang (“Sinfonia Concertante”, 1998, “Symphonic Suite”, 2008), Ho Chee Kong (“Enchanted Paths”, 2000), Bernard Tan (“Overture to Youth”, 2001), Philip Tan (“Ten Months”, 2003), Robert Casteels (“Kriesleriana”, 2004), Phoon Yew Tien ( “Summer Rhapsody”, 2009), and Chen Zhangyi ( “A Carp Emerges”, 2011).[^5]

#### **“Dance Suite” by Leong Yoon Pin (1982)**

The world premiere of “Dance Suite” was performed by the SYO on 1 March 1982 at Victoria Concert Hall.

Leong Yoon Pin (1931–2011) had been inspired by Malay folksongs “Katak Lompat” and “Ondeh Ondeh”, an Indian folksong called “The Highway”_,_ and Chinese folksongs “Counting Ducks’ Eggs” and “Smile When the Sun Shines”_._ In a 1982 interview, Leong said, “It seems so contrived to say that I’m influenced by many cultures in Singapore, but one can’t run away from them...” Leong was also inspired by poetry, particularly Tang poets such as Li Po and Tu Mu.[^6]

“Dance Suite” incorporates interesting compositional techniques like a 12-tone introduction (where all 12 notes of the chromatic scale are sounded equally often, avoiding the emphasis of any one note), alternating combinations of groups of instruments, and varying rhythmic structures of the chosen themes. In doing so, Leong created sound textures that evoked the sentiments of the original songs.

Of his compositional technique, he said, “With each symphonic composition, it gets more comfortable, construction-wise. I have many melodies floating around in my head. It’s only when you have a choice of melodies, that you can begin to conceptualise the entire composition.”[^7]

Leong took great pains to explain his vision and intention to conductor Vivien Goh and the young musicians. He had several discussions with Goh and attended many of their rehearsals.

Tan Kim Swee, the general manager of the orchestra, had the task of procuring unusual instruments required by the piece. In the case of “Dance Suite”, ankle bells, typically worn by Indian dancers, were needed.[^8]

Now regarded as the doyen of pioneer Singapore composers, Leong was, at the time of the commission, a Lecturer in the Music Department of the Institute of Education. He had studied piano in England with George Rogers, conducting with British conductor Robert Barclay Wilson and composed a work with renowned French composer Nadia Boulanger. Back in Singapore, Leong was the conductor of the Metro-Philharmonic Society Chorus and Orchestra (1959). He was also deeply involved in music education – first as a lecturer and head of music at the Teacher’s Training College (1958–88) and an advisor to organisations such as the National Arts Council, National Institute of Education and the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts. He was awarded the Cultural Medallion in 1982.[^9]

#### **“Variations on Dayong Sampan” by Phoon Yew Tien (1985)**

“Variations on Dayong Sampan” premiered in Singapore on 9 June 1985. It was also performed in Chorley, Lancashire in the UK on 20 June 1985.

Phoon Yew Tien’s (1952–) “Variations” was commissioned by the SYO specially for its visit to England. Based on the popular Malay folk song “Dayong Sampan”, this composition comprises 12 variations and a finale. The work discards the traditional practice of introducing the theme (referring to the tune of “Dayong Sampan”) at the beginning and instead goes straight into the first variation. The subsequent variations are linked via transitions that shared a common chordal structure. The piece shifts from one variation to another with the theme emerging gradually and building up to the finale.

Phoon’s interest in music started from early childhood. He was in the flute section of the Singapore Chinese Youth Orchestra, which had participated in the 1971 Festival of Youth Orchestras in Switzerland. He was mentored by composer Leong Yoon Pin in the 1970s and received a Singapore Symphonic Orchestra scholarship in 1980 to the Queensland Conservatorium of Music in Brisbane, Australia, where he graduated with a double degree in Music Composition and Flute. He won the Dulcie Robertson Prize in composition three times in 1980, 1981 and 1983, as well as the Yoshiro Irino Memorial Prize for Composition awarded by the Asian Composers’ Society in 1984 for a piece called “Autumn”.[^10]

Phoon returned to Singapore in 1983 and wrote music for drama and dance groups. He was also the assistant conductor of the People’s Association Chinese Orchestra, a forerunner of the Singapore Chinese Orchestra, and a lecturer and head of music at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts from 1984 to 1999. He received multiple awards from the Composers and Authors Society of Singapore (COMPASS) and was awarded the prestigious Cultural Medallion in Music in 1996.[^11]

#### **“Stasis” by Tsao Chieh (1988)**

“Stasis”, which premiered on 20 March 1988 at the Victoria Concert Hall, was inspired by the traditional music of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Bali, where rhythmic activity conveys a sense of equilibrium. This idea of stillness in change led to a piece strongly influenced by the “minimalist” style.[^12]

The whole piece is a succession of modes which are subsets of the scale of A major, initially comprising only two or three notes. The modes wax and wane in complexity. Controlled improvision is used in several places in the work and exotic instrumental effects such as bowed vibraphone, water gong and exhalation sounds for solo flute, strings, percussion and woodwind. At the climactic point, all the notes in A major are used simultaneously. After that, the modes gradually diminish in complexity. Vibraphone, celesta and solo violin end the piece on a pentatonic chord.

One challenge for this piece was the novel instruments needed. SYO Manager Tan Kim Swee was called upon to secure what he described as a “fantastic crop of instruments”.[^13] Among them was a glass chime, which he practically manufactured in his office using materials from a Science laboratory. They also needed a custom-built wooden tank fill with water for a tam-tam (gong) that had to be quickly immersed in water once struck. This tank had to be filled with water via a long hose attached to one of the taps in the toilets backstage.[^14]

Percussionist Daphne Tan recalled the laborious task of fetching water and preparing the tam-tam and the hefty water trough for each rehearsal. “My former section mates still jibe each other about the labours we experienced having to fetch water and laboriously prepare the “water gong” and its heavy water trough at each rehearsal,” she said. “To a bunch of apathetic teenagers at the time, it was a thankless task for a dubious effect which we felt could have been better met or substituted with less complicated means. You could almost hear our skepticism in the way we dunked the gong into the water.”[\[4\]](#_ftn4) That skepticism dissipated when they performed “Stasis” in Perth, Australia though.

“At the concert in Perth, our passive resistance melted away. Perhaps we were in awe of the concert venue, or maybe the thought of performing our programme to new musician friends our age spurred us on. Somehow, all of us became singularly focused from the first strike to make the music come alive to the audience.”[\[5\]](#_ftn5)
