####  **Dr Lee Kum Tatt was instrumental in the development of Singapore’s scientific and industrial landscape.**
By Sharad Pandian

On 6 September 1959, eight children died and 31 others from across Singapore were hospitalised. No one knew what caused the tragedy and the Singapore government’s Department of Chemistry (then under the Ministry of Health) was tasked to investigate.

Hearing that three of the deceased children had had homemade barley drinks before their deaths, the Department speculated that barley might be the culprit, prompting the government to issue a statement warning the public to avoid the grain. Dr Lee Kum Tatt, the toxicologist on the case, recalled, “Ridiculous and far-fetched as this suggestion might be, we had to make some kind of statement to calm the public.”[^1]

It was a race against the clock to identify and isolate the source. Lee and his small team of two laboratory assistants and a chemist, worked tirelessly to prevent further fatalities. Given that all the children had had barley drinks, Lee and his team collected 15 food samples from the victims’ homes, including barley. Mice were fed cheese injected with the samples and the single mouse given the barley extract dropped dead. Further analysis showed the presence of Parathian, an insecticide banned in Singapore.[^2]

The incident might have been the first time the public had heard of Lee, but over the years, he would go on to play a leading role in building scientific infrastructure in the country: this includes Singapore government’s Department of Chemistry, the Science Council, Singapore Polytechnic, the Singapore Institute of Standards and Industrial Research (SISIR), and the Singapore Science Centre. These contributions are all the more impressive when set in their historical context – the dangerous, uncertain Malaya of the mid-20th century.

#### **Early Years**

While he described himself as “quite apolitical,”[^3] Lee was nonetheless swept up in the dramatic political currents of his time – from the Second World War and violent postwar nationalism, to the Malayan Emergency and Malayanisation of the civil service.

His frequent relocations testify to the comparatively porous world that existed then: Born in Medan, Indonesia in 1927, Lee moved to Penang, Malaysia when he was six months old to live with his maternal grandparents. In 1940, he returned to his parents in Medan. Within a year, war broke out and the island was occupied by the Japanese.

Lee described those years as “very traumatic”.[^4] He stopped school and undertook jobs like selling charcoal, black marketing, and farming. And yet, at least retrospectively, he thought those years did him some good, ridding him of “ego and false pride” while teaching him to value honour and dignity instead.[^5]

The end of the war saw clashes between Indonesian nationalists and the Dutch who were trying to reassert their colonial dominance. Lee was a volunteer with the International Red Cross as an interpreter for the British Army (sent to disarm the Japanese). When his family was targeted for associating with foreigners, Lee and his family were forced to flee to Penang. There, he was able to complete his schooling and gain admission into Raffles College in 1948 to study chemistry.[^6]

Lee attained his Bachelor of Science three years later, in 1951. He graduated with honours under a Shell Scholarship the following year. Raffles College and the King Edward VII College of Medicine had merged to form the University of Malaya in 1949, which meant Lee was among one of the first cohorts to graduate from the new university.[^7]

Unfortunately, Lee graduated during the Malayan Emergency (1948–1960), the violent guerrilla war between the anti-colonial Communist Party of Malaya and the colonial government.[^8] When visiting the Rubber Research Institute in Kuala Lumpur for a prospective job, Lee was taken around in an armoured car for protection. That experience brought home the gravity of the situation: “That did it. I decided if I have to go up to work in Sungei Buloh with an armoured car, I’m not going to have it.”[^9]

He turned down the job and returned to the University of Malaya to pursue his doctorate as a Shell Research Fellow. There, he worked with Dr Rayson L. Huang on the research project “Synthesis of Synthetic Female Sex Hormones”, which Lee recounted as “an exciting project which few young men could resist.”[^10] He graduated in 1955 as the university’s first PhD in Chemistry.
