#### _Bunga kobis_ was a dish prepared only for special occasions because of how laborious it was to make. In this episode, librarian Toffa Abdul Wahed tells us more in her attempt to put together this many-layered pastry.

#### **Episode summary** ####
_Bunga kobis_, or “cabbage flower” in Malay, isn’t made of flowers or cabbages. So how did it get its name? Join librarian and food researcher Toffa Abdul Wahed as she tackles this recipe from a 1986 cookbook by Hajjah Asfiah Haji Abdullah, _Hidangan Warisan Kita_ (_Our Heritage Dishes_), and explains how it used to be a highlight at Malay weddings in Singapore a few decades ago. Today, this dish is no longer seen at special occasions.

#### **Recipes**
Making _bunga kobis_ is painstaking work and extremely challenging because of the number of layers it involves. Hajjah Asfiah’s recipe calls for six layers, each fried and nested within the next layer.

This recipe is taken from her cookbook’s final chapter about _gubahan_. _Gubahan_ is the Malay term for “arrangement” or “composition”. It can be used to refer to, for instance, an arrangement of flowers or a musical composition. Hajjah Asfiah used it to refer to elaborately prepared dishes made for special occasions like engagements and weddings.

Toffa stayed largely faithful to Hajjah Asfiah’s recipe, although she used groundnut oil instead of coconut oil for frying the pastry. She also used smaller quantities of coriander, Chinese celery, spring onion and chillies.

##### _Bunga kobis_

<b>For the dough skin:</b><br>
300 g wheat flour, sieved<br>
1 egg<br>
75 g ghee<br>
salt to taste (1 g or 1/2 tsp.)<br>
water (100 ml)<br>
700 ml groundnut oil<br>

<b>For the _rempah_:</b><br>
1 tbsp. ground coriander seeds<br>
1 tbsp. cumin seeds<br>
1 tbsp. fennel seeds<br>
2 cloves garlic<br>
3 cloves<br>
2.5 cm ginger<br>
2 cm cinnamon bark<br>
salt to taste<br>

<b>For the filling:</b><br>
300 g ground or minced beef<br>
300g or 1 large onion, diced<br>
20 g Chinese celery, chopped<br>
30 g spring onion, chopped<br>
4 red chillies (2 deseeded), sliced<br>
50 ml groundnut oil<br>
3 eggs (kept separate from filling)<br>

<b>For the garnish:</b><br>
tomatoes, carved into flowers<br>
lettuce (leaves separated)<br>

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the skin: Mix the flour, ghee, and egg well. Add salt and water, and knead until soft, like the dough for _epok-epok_ (curry puff).

2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Divide the dough into six portions, with the first being the smallest. Increase the amount of dough for each subsequent portion. \[Toffa calculated it as 6 %, 10 %, 14.5 %, 18.5 %, 23.5 % and 27.5 %.\]

3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the filling: Heat 50 ml of groundnut oil. Sauté ingredients for the _rempah_ until fragrant. Add the meat and a little water to tenderise it. Add the onion, and half the Chinese celery, spring onion and chili. Add salt to taste. When the meat is tender, turn off the heat and mix in the rest of the Chinese celery, spring onion and chili. Divide this filling into six portions, like how the dough was portioned.

4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crack 3 eggs into a beaker and beat slowly. Add a pinch of salt.

5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heat oil in a wok or pot over medium heat.

6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the meantime, roll out the smallest portion of dough and place the smallest portion of the filling on the rolled dough. Pour a bit of egg mixture onto the filling. Wrap the filling by folding and pinching the edges of the dough. Fry until cooked and golden brown, and set aside.

7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Work with the second portion of dough and filling. Pour in the egg mixture, then place the first portion that was fried earlier on top of the egg mixture. Wrap and fry until crisp and cooked. Repeat this process until all six portions are done. Remember to fry on medium heat. If the oil is too hot, the dough will burn but the filling inside will remain raw.

8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To serve, arrange lettuce leaves on a plate. Place the _bunga kobis_ in the middle of the plate and cut into 8 pieces/petals, beginning from the same point in the middle (like how you would cut a round cake). Open the petals so the dish looks like a flower. Place the tomato flowers in between the petals.
