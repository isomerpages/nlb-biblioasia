#### **Episode summary** ####
Because there was a rice shortage during the Japanese Occupation, people ate sweet potato and tapioca instead. Lee Geok Boi shows us what the human imagination is capable of by taking the humble tapioca and turning into two delicious dishes, using only ingredients that were available in Japanese-occupied Singapore.

#### **Recipes**
Geok Boi's recipes are inspired by tapioca noodles that were sold during wartime, and memories of her father's tapioca dessert. 

<b>Tapioca noodles</b>
![](/images/Videos:%20From%20Book%20to%20Cook/tapioca%20noodles.png)
<br>Makes about 500 g noodles, serves 4
<br>150 g tapioca chunks
<br>150 g grated tapioca 
<br>150 g tapioca starch  
<br>1½ tsp salt
<br>fish sauce
<br>chilli
<br>ginger
<br> clams
<br>Chinese celery

1. In a small pot, mix the tapioca chunks with 1 rice bowl water and bring to the boil. Turn down heat and simmer till tapioca is very tender. Add a little more water if necessary. Cool well, then mash the tapioca till fairly smooth, taking care to remove the tough string in the centre. The boiled tapioca can be mashed into the boiling water, if there is any left.  
2. In a mixing bowl, mix the mashed tapioca, tapioca starch and grated tapioca together with salt. Add enough coconut milk or water and knead well to form a medium-firm dough. 
3. Shape into rolls or flat cakes. 
4. Have ready a pot of boiling water. Drop the rolls or cakes into the boiling water. 
5. Boil till cakes float up and are translucent. It does not matter if cakes are not completely cooked through.
6. Scoop out and leave in a large bowl of cold water till ready to prepare the noodles. 
8. Before stir-frying, cut the cakes of noodles into preferred thickness. 
9. Heat oil in a wok and lightly fry the aromatics (chillis and ginger) till fragrant. 
10. Add clams. / seafood and the more tender vegetables such as chye sim, green bean or moringa leaves. If using vegetables that need some boiling such as yam leaves or sweet potato leaves, add those to the wok with some water and cook till tender before adding meat / seafood. 
11. Add hot noodles to the wok together with fish sauce / salt. If using belacan, add that to the oil at the start of cooking. 
12. Add enough water to get some gravy and bring back to the boil as well as to meld the flavours. 
13. Serve hot with sprinkling of chopped herbs. 

 
<b>Boiled tapioca with grated coconut</b>
![](/images/Videos:%20From%20Book%20to%20Cook/tapioca%20boiled.png)
<br>500 g tapioca, peeled and cut into chunks
<br>200 g gula melaka or to taste
<br>1/2 tsp. salt 
<br>500 ml water / thin coconut milk ( coconut milk optional) 
1. Put all ingredients into a pot and boil till tapioca chunks are done, fluffy and dryish. 
2. Add more water if needed. The amount of water needed will depend on the size of chunks. 
3. To check for doneness, stick a fork into the largest piece and break it up. 
4. When little liquid is left, stir and turn over the tapioca frequently to prevent burning. A few burnt spots are fragrant though. 
5. To serve, sprinkle freshly grated coconut or a squeeze of coconut cream.
