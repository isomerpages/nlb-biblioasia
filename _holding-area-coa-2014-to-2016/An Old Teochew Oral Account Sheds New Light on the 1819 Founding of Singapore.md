#### **Introduction: The Chinese in Singapore Before Raffles**

The landing of Sir Stamford Raffles at the Singapore River on 28 January
1819 is often seen as the turning point of Singapore’s history, marking
its modern era. To no small extent, this has been influenced by the
Englishman’s writings back home, which included his famous declarations
to the Duchess of Somerset of Singapore as “my new colony” and “a child
of my own and I have made it what it is”.1 Other luminary patrons were
briefed that the settlement’s original population “scarcely amounted to 200”
before it surged to “not less than 3,000” in three months, and that in over a
year, the “insignificant fishing village” had been transformed into a “port…
surrounded by an extensive town” with “ten or twelve thousand souls,
principally Chinese”.2

These testimonies invariably aggrandised Raffles’ personal role in the founding
of Singapore. However, a recently published private correspondence dated
8 January 1819 between Raffles and East India Company (EIC) Governor
General Lord Hastings, reveals his possession, at least nine days before sailing
from Penang to Singapore, of intelligence that his intended destination
already had “about 2,000 inhabitants upon it (new settlers) under a respectable
Chief” [text in parentheses in original].3 Conspicuously, all his known
communication to England excluded this information; for instance, Raffles
had later told Hastings that “when the British flag was first hoisted, there were
not perhaps fifty-three Chinese on the island”.4

Within two days of his arrival, Raffles had the written agreement of the
local ruler, Temenggong Abdul Rahman, to set up an EI C trading factory.
This was formalised by a treaty with the former Johor Sultanate crown
prince Tengku Long (whom he assented to recognise as Sultan Hussein
Shah) and the Temenggong on 6 February 1819.5 Exactly a week later, Raffles
prepared an official report to the EIC Supreme Government in Calcutta that
contained, among other insights, a full description of ongoing economic
activities in Singapore. In his own words:

   *… the industrious Chinese are already established in the interior<br> 
   and may soon be expected to supply vegetables, and c., and c., equal<br> 
   to the demand. The port is plentifully supplied with fish and turtle,<br> 
   which are said to be more abundant here than in any part of the<br> 
   archipelago. Rice, salt, and other necessaries are always procurable<br> 
   from Siam, the granary of the Malay tribes in this quarter.<br> 
   Timber abounds in the island and its vicinity; a large part of the<br> 
   population are already engaged in building boats and vessels, and<br> 
   the Chinese of whom some are already engaged in smelting the<br> 
   ore brought from the tin mines on the neighbouring islands, and<br> 
   others employed as cultivators and artificers, may soon be expected<br> 
   to increase in a number proportionate to the wants and interests of<br> 
   the settlement…*6

Without question these were commercial activities beyond the scale of an
“insignificant fishing village” and the Chinese participation in them was
not inconsequential.

Between giving two contrasting pictures – one of a sleepy village with 200
persons and another of a bustling new settlement of 2,000 individuals –
Raffles privately admitted to a merchant in Penang that Singapore had, as
of end-January 1819, “only five hundred” persons who were “inhabitants
from Malacca and Rhio that are gone there”.7 This was as close as he got to
the truth; the first resident of Singapore, William Farquhar, independently
confirmed many years later that the Temenggong was found established
with “four or five hundred followers”.8

Another member of the 1819 expedition party, Captain John Crawford,
recalled in his diary an encounter with “upwards of 100” Chinese, who
offered themselves as labourers and were duly hired to cut down rank grass
and root out jungle near the British tents.9

Eminent Raffles scholar John Bastin considered Raffles’ acknowledgement
of the Chinese in his February 1819 official report “an interesting reference”.10

However, outside of writings that completely overlook them, these Chinese
have barely merited more than passing mentions by Singapore historians, so
as to stress the smallness of their number.11 In a recent instance, they were
even assumed to be “very lost”.12 The implication is that existing accounts of
Singapore’s modern founding have drawn on incomplete information about
an anonymous, but important, group of Chinese.

#### **An Old Teochew Oral Account**

The Teochews hailing from the eastern Guangdong Province were one of
the first resident groups of Chinese in Singapore. In the earliest-known
written description of the Chinese in Singapore by one of its own members,
prominent Teochew merchant Seah Eu Chin, it was reported in 1848 that
his “tribe” was then the largest, accounting for 19,000 out of 40,000 Chinese
in total.13

At present, nearly all published knowledge about the Singapore Teochew
community in the early half of the 19th century centres on Seah’s life and
his success as a plantation owner that earned him the nickname “Gambier
King”. However, Seah only arrived in Singapore in 1823 at a relatively young
age of 18, and a handful of late-1940s and early-1950s publications by the
Teochew community expressed an unequivocal belief that the Teochews
had been established in Singapore even before a port was opened in 1819.14

If true, then there is a good possibility that the first group of Chinese in
Singapore reported by Raffles were Teochew. However, there had been no
writings to support the grounds for the Teochews’ conviction that their
forefathers were in Singapore before Raffles, until an elucidation of how the
Teochews first arrived was presented in the 1950 publication *Teo-chews in
Malaya* (《马来亚潮侨通鉴》).

The editor of this encyclopaedic title, which focused on the background and
activities of the Teochew migrant communities in Singapore and Malaya,
was Phua Chye Long (潘醒农),15 a publisher and an office-bearer with Ngee
Ann Kongsi and Singapore Teochew Poit Ip Huay Kuan.16 He was also
the author of the relevant text that was attributed to the oral tradition. It
appears over two separate passages in the book and an English translation of
the first passage is as follows:

   *It is said that before Englishman Sir Raffles arrived, Singapore<br> 
   was a fishing village and a Malay sultan resided in Sek Lak Mung<br> 
   (石叻门)*.17<br><br>  

   *There were more than 10 persons from Hai Ior (海阳),18 who were<br> 
   all tragically killed by the Malays; and subsequently Teochew<br> 
   sojourners were recruited from Siam, and they lived at Sua Kia<br> 
   Deng (山仔顶, meaning “top of the little hill” ), which is the Wak<br> 
   Hai Cheng Bio (粤海清庙) compound of today*.19
	 
   *From Dang Khoi, Ampou (庵埠东溪), hailed two men, Heng Kim<br> 
   (王钦, a descendant of Tsap Poih Buan Seng [十八万胜]) and Heng<br> 
   Hong Sung (王丰顺), who sailed to Singapore before others and, as<br> 
   leaders of the Teochew sojourners, built Wak Hai Cheng Bio and<br> 
   formed Ngee Ann Kun (义安郡)*.20<br><br>  

   *Thereafter, whenever Teochew sojourners sailed south to Singapore,<br> 
   the red-head junks would moor in front of the temple,21 and [the<br> 
   migrants] would put up inside the premises, so that whoever<br> 
   wanted to hire a shop assistant could negotiate with them there*.<br><br>  

   *Until 1819 when Sir Raffles obtained a lease for Singapore, Sung<br> 
   Heng (顺兴) gambier plantation was their base; this is today’s<br> 
   Uang Ge Sua (王家山),22 and by then the number of the Teochew<br> 
   sojourners was already in the thousands*.23

The second write-up of what we may term, for the purposes of discussion,
as the “Teochew oral account” similarly told of two waves of arrival of the
Teochew people in Singapore, before Raffles arrived in 1819. A translation of
it reads:

   *According to the oral traditions, at the beginning a group of more<br>
   than 10 persons from Hai Ior travelled afar to Singapore, but<br>
   they were all tragically killed by local Malays. Subsequently a<br>
   number of Teochew sojourners came from Siam, and they lived at<br>
   Sua Kia Deng (that is the present Wak Hai Cheng Bio grounds)<br>
   and around Boat Quay, which became the base of the Teochew<br>
   sojourners in Singapore*.<br><br>

   *At that time the Malay ruler’s seat was at today’s Sek Lak Mung,<br>
   and though the Chinese and the natives were mixed freely, there<br>
   was peace among them*.<br><br>

   *Hailing from Dang Khoi, Ampou were Heng Kim and Heng<br>
   Hong Sung, who were the descendants of Tsap Poih Buan Seng,<br>
   a forerunner of the junk trade, and in his day leader of the<br>
   Teochew sojourners*.<br><br>

   *Thereafter the Teochew sojourners migrated south continuously and<br>
   their numbers grew by the day…*24

Except for uncertainty over whether only Heng Kim, or both Heng Kim
and Heng Hong Sung, descended from Tsap Poih Buan Seng, the two texts
can be seen to adhere to a coherent storyline.

Notwithstanding references to him as a sultan, the unnamed Malay ruler
can be readily identified as Temenggong Abdul Rahman, the Johor Chief
Minister for Justice. Holding hereditary fief over the Singapore Straits and
land on both sides (except for Riau and Lingga),25 he moved to Singapore
with 150 followers in 1811 and lived by the north bank of the Singapore
River (see Map 1) until the British compelled the relocation of his* istana*
(palace) to Telok Blangah in 1823.26

Cheng Bio, Boat Quay, Raffles’ landing site, Temenggong Istana and Fort Canning Hill. <i>Map data © 2018 Google, Urban Development Authority.</i></div>

Phua confirms this identification in another section of T*eo-chews* in Malaya,
introducing Wak Hai Cheng Bio:

   *The temple compound that at first covered more than 130 acres was<br> 
   a grant by the Temenggong-Sultan (图明果苏丹). Later when the<br> 
   land lease was obtained, the document reflected only the present<br> 
   site that measures 13,273 square feet in total, as the rest of the land<br> 
   had been parcelled out by others to build shops and houses*.27

Though the Teochew oral account was composed during a period of growing
Chinese nationalism and anti-colonial sentiment in the mid-20th century, it
is necessary to observe that its balanced presentation does not overtly exalt the
Chinese or denigrate the British. To a large part this can be credited to Phua’s
standing as a leader in the literary field among the overseas Teochews.28

As testament to its broad acceptance within the Chinese-language
scholarship, the Teochew oral account has, in subsequent years, been cited
or referenced in a number of Chinese publications concerning the history
of the Chinese in Singapore and Teochews overseas.29 Until today, its key
points continue to be quoted in local and overseas Chinese-language news
reports and online articles.30

Critically, however, Phua’s writings on the activities of Heng Kim, Heng Hong
Sung and their followers failed to stir any discussion in mainstream historical
circles about the evidence of early Teochew migration to Singapore. This may be due to the Teochew oral account’s limited circulation, its unknown
provenance (in accordance to literary practice of Phua’s day, he did not name
or profile any of his informants), or its regurgitation by writers who assumed
its credibility without providing any further justification. The Teochew oral
account may also have been simply ignored because it contradicted popular
recognition of Raffles as the founder of modern Singapore.

Oral traditions, being narratives passed down by word-of-mouth
over generations, are vulnerable to distortion due to the tendency of
transmitters to conflate disparate events, contributing to an inevitable loss
of detail over time.

That the Teochew oral account is not without deficiency is emphasised
by its sketchy rendering of the alleged ill-fated landing of the men from
Hai Ior – even if the deadly incident’s plausibility is supported by Dutch
representations of pre-1819 Singapore as a “den of murderers” and of
Temenggong Abdul Rahman as the “head of the pirates”.31

Still, the account is significant as it seeks to tell the story of the Chinese
who were already in Singapore when Raffles arrived. It cannot be dismissed
without an investigation into the writings of the Englishman, Farquhar and
other established historical sources, to discover whether the “industrious
Chinese” Raffles reported about in February 1819 were indeed Teochew.
Should an affirmative answer to this pivotal question be found, the inquiry
can then be extended to other major revelations of the Teochew oral
account, including its claims that the first Teochews in Singapore came
immediately from Siam and were settled at Sua Kia Deng, as well as if their
named leaders, Heng Kim and Heng Hong Sung, were actual persons and
co-founders of Wak Hai Cheng Bio.

#### **Ascertaining if the First Chinese in Singapore Were Teochew**

Although Raffles alluded to being responsible for the early Chinese influx
into Singapore on more than one occasion, a review of his surviving writings
reveals that he never wrote about them again after his initial communications
with Calcutta. In fact, he displayed scarce interest in the Chinese who were in Singapore before him; it was only on his third visit in October 1822 that his
secretary, Lieutenant L.N. Hull, enquired of Farquhar on their background.


Through Farquhar’s replies, we learn that these men were among “various
Malays and Chinese” whom Temenggong Abdul Rahman had granted
leave to clear ground for plantations, of which about 20 had commenced
prior to British establishment. The resident also observed the location
of a Chinese gambier plantation on the western side of Selegie Hill, and
another on the northeast portion of a range to the westward of Fort
Canning Hill (see Map 2).32

<img src="/images/COA%202014%20to%202016/Old%20Teochew%20Account/Map_2__Map_of_Singapore_18_June_1825.jpg" style="width:80%;">

In addition, Farquhar identified the Chinese gambier planters as followers of
a “Captain China” (sometimes reported as “China Captain”) and reported
that they were settled before the British arrived at the Singapore River’s
north bank that later became a cantonment site.33 In 1823, the Captain
China was ordered to remove a “Chinese moveable Temple” and “lights
from the Great Tree” from a site reserved for a church, which the “Jackson
Plan” of 1822 shows to be before Hill Street, at the foot of Fort Canning Hill
(see Map 3).34

These revelations match the Teochew oral account’s report concerning a
Teochew base around Sung Heng gambier plantation at Fort Canning Hill.
Though Farquhar stopped short of calling these gambier planters Teochew,
he left an important clue with regards to their leader.

According to Farquhar, the first Captain China of Singapore was a “Canton
Chinese”, as opposed to “Amoy Chinese”, whose “great increase” in number later necessitated the appointment of a second captain.35 The historical
status of Amoy (now Xiamen) as the principal port of southern Fujian
makes certain that the “Amoy Chinese” were the Hokkiens. Intuitively one
might suppose the “Canton Chinese” to be Cantonese natives from around
Canton (now Guangzhou). However, this is precluded by Seah Eu Chin’s
revelation that of all the gambier and pepper planters in Singapore in 1848,
10,000 were Teochews and another 400 were “Macao”.36 This spells out that
Cantonese people were not labelled then as they are today, but in accordance
to the main port wherefrom they left China before the First Opium War. At
the same time, it exhibits a Teochew monopoly over the gambier industry.

In demand across Southeast Asia as an ingredient for the habitual chewing
of betel nut, gambier was significant as the primary export product of
nearby Riau before the mid-19th century. As told in the Johor historical
chronicles *Tuhfat al-Nafis*, its commercial cultivation was introduced
around 1740 to attract trade from Java and elsewhere, and “Chinese from
China” were brought in as labourers in holdings opened by the Malays and
Bugis.37 After these natives were driven out by war in the 1780s, the Dutch,
who thereafter occupied Riau, reported the takeover of the plantations
by two Chinese communities, whom they referred to as “Kantongers”
and “Emooijers”.38 Divided by bitter rivalry, they each had a Kapitein (or
Captain) residing on opposing river banks at Senggarang and Tanjung
Pinang respectively.39

Farquhar’s use of the terms “Canton Chinese” and “Amoy Chinese”
were copied from the Dutch and can be derived from Raffles’ disclosure
that Singapore’s early inhabitants were “from Malacca and Rhio”. The
subsequent Teochew dominance of the Singapore gambier industry– coupled with an assertion by the late local Teochew leader Yeo Chan Boon
that Teochew cultivators were established in Riau before the opening of
Singapore’s port – strongly suggests that the “Canton Chinese” in Singapore
could only be Teochews who moved over from Riau.40

This is supported by a 1976 study on the Chinese in Riau, which found that
Senggarang was colloquially known as Teo Bo (潮坡), the “Teochew bank”,
and Tanjung Pinang was known as Hok Bo (福坡), the “Hokkien bank”.41 

#### **The Immediate Origin of Settlers from Siam**

That the first Chinese settlers in Singapore were Teochews from Riau would
back the Teochew oral account’s authenticity. But why did it portray the
same group of people to be from Siam?

Even though British and Malay sources do not refer to a Siamese
representation in early 1819 Singapore, a hidden connection is given away by
the kingdom’s “first importance” when the onset of the northeast monsoon
at the end of the year brought from various “Eastern ports” the first waves
of cargo-laden native trading vessels.42 At the end of Singapore’s maiden
trading season of the modern era four months later, its harbour was noted to
have “upwards of twenty junks, three of which [were] from China, and two
from Cochin China, the rest from Siam and other quarters”.43 The level of
trade astonished Farquhar for the British had done nothing to induce it.

Only in January 1820 did a combination of Dutch hostility towards
the British occupation of Singapore and the EI C’s financial constraints culminate in instructions from the company’s leadership to Farquhar to
consider Singapore “rather as a military post than as a fixed settlement”.44

The junks from Siam were, in fact, operated by Chinese traders. As reported
by John Crawfurd, who headed a British embassy to Siam in 1821, it was
a hub to “about two hundred” Chinese junks that carried out different
branches of trade to ports in China and Southeast Asia. Encouraged by
the Siamese government, they also brought thousands of migrant Chinese
workers to commence large-scale sugarcane cultivation in plantations after
1809.45 Importantly, among the Chinese in Bangkok, the Teochew were
“the most numerous” and “in the forefront of those holding state power
and ennoblement”.46 In this context, the Teochew oral account’s intimation
of Singapore Teochew leaders Heng Kim and Heng Hong Sun as family
relations of Tsap Poih Buan Seng – “a forerunner of the junk trade, and in
his day leader of the Teochew sojourners” – becomes telling.

Tsap Poih Buan Seng, according to online and news reports from China,
was the moniker of a Teochew named Tan Buan Seng (陈万胜), also known
as Tan Seng Lai (陈胜来), who had left his village Tai Mui (岱美) to seek a
livelihood in Siam during the reign of Qing dynasty Emperor Qianlong
(1736–1796). He eventually became a wealthy junk trader and owned 18
vessels – hence his Teochew nickname of “Eighteen Buan Seng”.47 Beyond
this, Tan was recorded in Qing imperial records as the letter-bearer of
Siamese monarch King Taksin in a diplomatic mission to Canton to seek
a military alliance against Burma in 1775.48 While Tan was probably no longer alive in 1819, his legacy would sufficiently explain the Siamese role in
Singapore’s revival as a trading entrepôt.

The reign of King Taksin, who became ruler after the Ayutthaya dynasty was
destroyed by Burmese invaders in 1767, was highly significant for the fact that
he was the son of a Teochew immigrant. Viewed as a usurper by the country’s
old establishment, he built his kingship upon an army served by no small
number of his paternal kinsmen and relied on a cohort of trusted Teochew
merchants in Bangkok to raise revenue through active overseas trade.49 Of
relevance is that Siam was a key trading partner of Riau in the 1770s when
Bugis chief Raja Haji was Yam Tuan Muda (viceroy) of the settlement. Many
Chinese merchants from Siam came to trade vast quantities of tableware,
textiles, silk and rice.50 A deity tablet dedicated to the Chinese junk traders’
titular deity Mazu (妈祖) in 1779 by Chua Iou Kho (蔡耀可) discovered in
Senggarang proves a leading Teochew role in this development.51

Hostilities between the Bugis and Dutch government in Melaka in the mid-
1780s ultimately compelled Sultan Mahmud to shift the Johor Sultanate’s
seat of power to Lingga. However, Teochew traders from Siam returned to
Riau after the old sovereign passed away in 1811 and Raja Jaafar, son of Raja
Haji, made himself the sultanate’s strongman by installing Tengku Long’s
younger brother as a puppet ruler.52 A wooden plaque was presented in the
same year to the Mazu temple in Senggarang by Kapitan Tan Ngueng Pang
(陈源放),53 whose Teochew background is revealed by the discovery of the
Dutch, upon their return to Riau in 1818, that all the local Chinese were
now under a single captain office held by the “Kantonner Chinezen”.54

Despite Raffles’ claim of Singapore as “my new colony”, the concession he
obtained from his agreements with the Malays in 1819 had been merely a
lease to set up a factory, without the transfer of Singapore’s sovereignty. This
state of affairs was clearly reflected in *Hailu* (海录), the travelogue of Hakka
seafarer Hsieh Ch’ing Kao (谢清高), published in 1820. While acknowledging
the formation of a trading centre by the British in Singapore, it depicted
the place unambiguously as a part of Old Johor (i.e. mainland Johor) and
further recorded its reference by natives as Selat, meaning the “straits” in
Malay – apparently in relation to Temenggong Abdul Rahman’s fiefdom
over the Singapore Straits; and by the Chinese from Fujian and Guangdong
as the “new prefecture” (新州府), which apparently stemmed from Tengku
Long’s new status as sultan.55

Conceivably, the Teochew oral account is silent about the movement of
Teochews from Riau to Singapore because its originators perceived Riau and
Singapore to be within the boundaries of a common dominion (that is, the
Johor Sultanate).

#### **Settlement at Sua Kia Deng**

Following British administration of the harbour at the mouth of Singapore
River, the followers of Captain China were settled near Fort Canning Hill,
which was subsequently designated for cantonment use – this obliged the
settlers to relocate.56 Thereafter, based on the “Arrangement Made for the
Singapore Government” signed between Malay and British leaders on
26 June 1819, these Chinese were instructed to “move to the other side of the
river, forming a *campong* [town] from the site of the large bridge down the
river, towards the mouth”.57

An update by Farquhar at the start of September 1819 informed Raffles that
the new precinct was “becoming extensive” and “new streets [had] been laid out to meet the steadily increasing population”.58 Significantly, the
*Bute Map*, drawn around this time and believed to be the earliest-known
landward map of modern Singapore (see Map 4), illustrates the limits of
this Chinese town and adjoining cleared grounds to encompass both the
premises of Wak Hai Cheng Bio and what is now Boat Quay – exactly as
told in the Teochew oral account.59

<img src="/images/COA%202014%20to%202016/Old%20Teochew%20Account/Map_4__Partial_view_of_the_Bute_Map.jpg" style="width:80%;">

the name Sua Kia Deng was derived.<i> The Bute Archive at Mount Stuart.</i></div>

Following the arrival of the first junks from Siam and China, Farquhar
reported in March 1820 that “the swampy ground on the opposite side
of the river is now almost covered with Chinese houses”.60 However, the
distinguished Malay language scribe Munshi Abdullah, who moved from
Melaka to settle in Singapore in mid-1819, observed that this side of the
Singapore River originally had “no good piece of ground even as much as
sixty yards wide, the whole place being covered in deep mud, except only
on the hills where the soil was clay”.61 This sheds light that the resident’s
statement was probably less of excitement, and more of surprise that there
had been any construction at all.

Owing to conditions “where the tide rose ten feet and extended to some
distance”, the Boat Quay riverside was, as late as 1822, occupied only by “a
few native traders” (a term inclusive of the Chinese) living in *rumah rakit*,
or “raft houses”, erected over the swamp.62 Most of the settlers here would
have conceivably built their houses on drier land and the recollection in
the Teochew oral account of the place-name “Sua Kia Deng”, or “top of
the little hill”, invariably compels attention to a promontory in the locality
that Munshi Abdullah remarked somewhat favourably as “a large rise, of
moderate elevation”.

Marked on the *Bute Map* as between the Chinese town and sea, this
hill stood at what is presently Raffles Place. Though it was nameless, the
traditional settlement of Sua Kia Deng was verified by a letter submitted by
the Chinese inhabitants to Raffles in December 1822, confirming that there
were 130 houses built on its top.63

Ironically, this letter was a petition against a second eviction notice served
to the Teochews after Raffles had planned to level the hill to make way for
a new commercial square and use its earth to reclaim what would become
Boat Quay.64 This was fulfilled in 1823, and as a result the feature behind
the name Sua Kia Deng was not seen on any subsequent maps of Singapore,
until the *Bute Map* resurfaced and was publicly exhibited in the country in
2012. If anything, the memory of Sua Kia Deng is a tell-tale sign of the age
of the oral traditions underlying the Teochew oral account.

#### **The Relation of Captain China with Heng Kim and Heng Hong Sung**

If the Teochew oral account’s accuracy is assumed, then Captain China in
Farquhar’s statements had to refer to either Heng Kim or Heng Hong Sung.
Yet for unknown reasons, the actual name of Captain China was never
disclosed in his writings or those of his peers.

Assurance that the portrayals of Heng Kim and Heng Hong Sung were not
without basis: it is supported by a positive identification of their purported
home, Dang Khoi, with an existing village of same name in the Teochew
region located some 20 kilometres from the town of Ampou (see Map 5).
Residents there claim lineage from a common ancestor with the surname
Heng.65 They also reportedly recall a period of local affluence brought on
by shipping and ventures abroad after the mid-Qing dynasty,66 which could be related to the installation of the Teochew prefecture’s chief maritime
customs office at Ampou in 1730. All these support the conjecture that both
Teochew leaders in Singapore were Dang Khoi natives.

King Taksin), Tai Mui and Changlim (a port town reputed as “home of the
red-head junks”).<i> Map data © 2017 Google.</i></div>

However, this does not corroborate the Teochew oral account’s
representation that either Heng Kim, or both men, descended from Tsap
Poih Buan Seng, who was found to bear the surname Tan and have roots in
the village of Tai Mui.

An answer to this conundrum has been elusive in Singapore. Fortunately,
a wooden board in Senggarang’s second temple worshipping the martial
deity Xuan Tian Shang Di (玄天上帝) has the date of its commission (the
commencement of Qing Emperor Daoguang’s reign, 1821) inscribed on
both ends, as well as the title and name of its donor Kapitan Tan Heng Kim
(陈亨钦) (see Image 1).67 In spoken Teochew, the Chinese characters 王 (from
Heng Kim [王钦]), in the context of a surname, and 亨 (from Tan Heng Kim
[陈亨钦]), are both pronounced as “heng”.68

Further, a Dutch list of the Teochews who were the Chinese captains of Riau
from 1818 to 1828 contains the names Tan-Hoo, Tan-Tiauw-Goean and Tan-
Ahooi69 – none sounding close to Tan Heng Kim. What can be surmised
from these clues is that the benefactor of the temple Tan Heng Kim was the
Heng Kim mentioned in the Teochew oral account (where his surname was
apparently lost), who was simultaneously the enigmatic Captain China in
Farquhar’s letters.

The reverence of Xuan Tian Shang Di is not without implication. This
deity was not only revered by the Teochews in Singapore as Tua Lau Ia
(大老爷), or “Chief Guardian Deity”,70 but was also the resident idol in Lao
Pun Tao Kong Shrine (老本头公庙, built before 1824), the oldest Chinese
temple in Bangkok’s Sampheng district, where the Teochew merchant community serving King Taksin had resettled after his rule ended
in 1782.71

Worthy of note is that the same Xuan Tian Shang Di temple in Senggarang
contained another artefact contributed in 1814 by a devotee with the
partially-legible name Heng Hok [illegible character] (王福?),72 while
government records in Singapore registered the sale of gambier plantations
by three persons – Tan Ngun Ha, Tan Ah Loo and Heng Tooan – to
Captain James Pearl in May 1822.73 The recurrences of the surnames Tan
and Heng allow us to surmise that the first commercial enterprise in
modern Singapore was formed by a Teochew partnership between members
of a Tan clan based in Siam and a Heng clan from Dang Khoi.

#### **Founding of Wak Hai Cheng Bio**

Unlike a typical Chinese temple, Wak Hai Cheng Bio has not one, but two
resident deities – Xuan Tian Shang Di and Mazu. The pair are housed in an
edifice with adjoining prayer halls first built by Ngee Ann Kongsi between 1852
and 1855. While there is scant documentation of the temple’s early years, temple
traditions hold that its site was once occupied by a lone *attap* hut sheltering a
Mazu altar, before a Xuan Tian Shang Di shrine was added in 1826.74

This chronology of events dovetails with the Teochew oral account’s
depiction of Wak Hai Cheng Bio being co-founded by Tan Heng Kim and
Heng Hong Sung. Moreover, the account’s claim of the temple’s premises
being used for the landing of travellers and goods is affirmed by the Malay
reference to the Sua Kia Deng area as “Lorong Tambangan”, meaning “ferry lane”, as well as the recorded presence of the Master Attendant Captain
William Flint’s residence and an “old fish market” nearby.75

As for when the Mazu shrine was built, it is conceivable that this happened
only after end-June 1819, as inferred from Phua’s assertion in *Teo-chews in
Malaya* that the Wak Hai Cheng Bio land was a grant from Temenggong
Abdul Rahman, as well as Munshi Abdullah’s report that the Singapore
River south bank had “nothing to be seen” before Chinese settlement.76
Further, considering the practice that every Teochew junk plying the route
between China and Siam carried on board an idol of Mazu, which had to
be invited into a temple or shrine at the destination port before goods were
unloaded,77 this structure must have already stood along the Singapore
River prior to Farquhar’s notice on the first junks from China and Siam in
end-March 1820.

The estimation of dates is supported by the transaction record, dated
18 September 1822, of a house in Chinatown, whose location was reported
to be “on the sea side of the Road leading past the *old Chinese temple*”
[emphasis added].78

Oddly enough, differing information on the temple was presented in a
write-up in *Teo-chews in Malaya*: Phua had penned instead that “Wak Hai
Cheng Bio, as told, was at first an *attap* hut built by Lim Phueng (林泮),
which till the third reign year of Qing Emperor Qianlong (i.e. 1738) was
rebuilt many times…” In yet another part of the book, Phua characterised
Lim Phueng as the founder of Ban See Soon Kongsi (万世顺公司) – reportedly
an entity in Singapore set up to manage monetary gifts to Mazu from
Teochew travellers from the Teochew region, Siam or Vietnam – and reported that this man was in Singapore in the early Qing period but was
executed by a government official in China in 1738.79

Any possible connection between Lim Phueng and the first sojourners from
Hai Ior was not raised.

Phua subsequently revised in his other publications the year of Wak Hai
Cheng Bio’s foundation to the final year of Emperor Qianlong’s reign
(1796).80 However, he did not make the change because he saw it was
implausible that the Teochew people were active in Singapore some 80
years ahead of British arrival. He later reverted in a 1976 newspaper article
to his original position that the Mazu *attap* shrine had been erected before
1738, but substituted Heng Hong Sung for Lim Phueng as the Ban See
Soon Kongsi founder.81 Phua’s back and forth changes were seemingly
compelled by his realisation that Lim Phueng, a merchant with a well-documented
life, could not have been in Singapore in the 1730s. Famed
for building a luxurious garden-mansion in the Teochew port town of
Changlim (樟林) in 1799, Lim Phueng was put to death following a highprofile
legal case in 1805.82

Despite uncertainty on his part, Phua did not relent on the existence of a
Mazu shrine before the end of the 18th century. His insistence appears to be
based on knowledge of oral traditions tied to Ban See Soon Kongsi. Similar
to Phua’s writings, a working report issued by the Singapore Teo Chew Sai
Ho Association in 1949 linked Wak Hai Cheng Bio’s foundation to Ban See
Soon Kongsi. However it stated that the latter was formed at the beginning
of Qing Emperor Qianlong’s reign in 1735, through the funding by Teochew red-head junk travellers in Singapore obligated to Mazu.83 The Teo Chew Sai
Ho Association report made no reference to Lim Phueng.

In view of established knowledge on Singapore’s history, the possibility
that a group of Teochew traders were active on the island before 1800 is
remote. On the other hand, the notice in *Tuhfat al Nafis* about “Chinese
from China” being brought into Riau around 1740, as well as markings
of a “Chinese compound” there in British navigation charts between 1750
and 1762 (see Map 6), show that it was a place where Chinese traders
congregated. While the 1779 Mazu deity tablet in Senggarang is the oldestknown
physical proof of Teochew presence in Riau, Scottish sea captain
Alexander Hamilton’s observation that about 1,000 Chinese families were
settled in the towns of Johor at the beginning of the century supports the
likelihood that some Teochew merchants might have been active there as
early as the 1730s.84

Accordingly, it is not an unreasonable conjecture that the oral traditions
speak of two separate Mazu *attap* shrines. One being Wak Hai Cheng
Bio’s forerunner that Tan Heng Kim and Heng Hong Sung set up by the
Singapore River circa 1819 as reported by the Teochew oral account, and the
other erected in the 1730s by Ban See Soon Kongsi that must have stood in
Riau. An uncanny resemblance between Wak Hai Cheng Bio’s façade and
the front view of Senggarang’s Mazu-Xuan Tian Shang Di twin temples (see
Image 2) serves as a strong reminder that the Teochews on either side of the
Singapore Straits were in fact two faces of one single community.

Nearly every historical writing and material evidence originating from the
Malays, Chinese, British or Dutch concur that until 1819 Riau fulfilled the
role of the much-needed entrepôt on the Singapore Straits. The intertwined
traditions of Wak Hai Cheng Bio and the Senggarang temples call attention
to the need to comprehend modern Singapore’s sudden emergence within
the context of preceding developments in its surroundings, especially in
Riau. An important point in relation to this is the oft-overlooked fact that
Raffles himself was bound for Riau to set up an EI C station when he set sail from Calcutta on 7 December 1818, and only re-directed his course to
Singapore after receiving news from Farquhar in Penang that the principal
port of Johor had fallen under Dutch control.85

#### **A Final Question**

By November 1821, Singapore was reported to have had a “regularly built
Chinese town” on the south bank of the Singapore River, while “plantations
of gambier, pepper and other spices [had] already [made] their appearance
in many parts”.86 Corroborations of its nearly every detail by other historical
sources confirm the Teochew oral account to be from the voices of the
Chinese behind these various developments.

Yet, one question remains: What made the Teochew gambier planters move
to Singapore before the British came, especially if they knew the Malays
there had previously slain their kinsmen?

The background of these Teochews as “sojourners recruited from Siam”
suggests that they did not come to Singapore on their own initiative. The
identity of the person who arranged for their migration is given away by
a clause in the June 1819 *Arrangement Made for the Singapore Government*:
“[T]he gardens and plantations that now are, or may hereafter be made”
to be placed “at the disposal of the Tumungong, as heretofore”.87 Crucially,
Temenggong Abdul Rahman was also documented to have provided for
the cost and expenses of gambier plantations opened at Mount Stamford
(now Pearl’s Hill) prior to the arrival of the British and “in some instances”
advanced money to Teochew cultivators with the understanding that he
would be repaid in the form of gambier or other produce.88 An impression Farquhar got from the Captain China – “one of the principal persons
concerned” – was that the temenggong’s interests in these plantations were
represented by his brother-in-law named Baba Ketchil, which adds more
weight to the importance of these arrangements.89

Raffles’ characterisation of Singapore’s inhabitants as “new settlers” in his
8 January 1819 letter to Hastings implied that the Teochews only arrived
on the island towards the end of 1818. The timing exposes a relationship to
another key event, which was the conclusion of a treaty on 28 November
1818 by which Raja Jaafar permitted the Dutch to re-occupy Riau.

Besides Tengku Long, Temenggong Abdul Rahman was said to be the most
vocal in opposing this agreement.90 This is hardly surprising as he professed
to be an exile in Singapore,91 apparently as an outcome of Raja Jaafar’s
political coup. More pertinently, the “head of the pirates” was manifestly the
target of various articles in the Johor-Dutch pact, which obliged the Sultan
of Johor to eradicate piracy and even grant the Dutch a host of powers to
ensure this outcome.92

Inexplicably, it was the temenggong who ratified this treaty by affixing his
seal on it, after the incumbent sultan (Tengku Long’s younger brother)
refused to be involved. A plausible explanation for this situation is that Raja
Jaafar had struck a bargain with Temenggong Abdul Rahman, permitting
him to commence gambier planting in Singapore in return for rubberstamping
his own deal with Melaka.

Interestingly, the diary of Captain John Crawford recorded that shortly
after Raffles landed in Singapore, his request to disembark his soldiers
and plant the British flag was acceded to by the temenggong with the
exclamation that “nothing could give them greater happiness than to be in alliance with the English”.93 Only after this did the two leaders seal
their first agreement, by which the EI C was committed to not only pay
the Johor minister 3,000 Spanish dollars a year, but also to protect him.
To this end, there seems little question to the Malay chief’s intention
for rebellion against the powers in Riau. From his perspective, Raffles’
unexpected appearance with generous offers of money and military
support could not have been more timely and helpful.

#### **Conclusion**

Temenggong Abdul Rahman’s agenda was not military, but trade through
the creation of a rival port in Singapore. His negotiation in the 6 February
1819 treaty for “a moiety or full half of all the amount collected from Native
Vessels” amply hints at this.94

This leaves room to ponder if the commercial value of gambier, as well as
Raffles’ excited anticipation of Singapore’s access to “rice, salt, and other
necessaries” from Siam (a country the British had no official trade with
since an English community was massacred in Mergui in 1687), might not
be signs that the temenggong already had an understanding with Tan Heng
Kim to start a trading centre in Singapore before Raffles’ arrival.

By persistently insisting in his writings that he arrived at “an insignificant
fishing village” in January 1819 and alluding to be responsible for the
immediate influx of Chinese migrants, Raffles managed to whitewash the
roles of Temenggong Abdul Rahman and his Teochew partners behind
Singapore’s much-vaunted rise as a centre of commerce, while convincing
others that the achievement was entirely his own.

However, an old Teochew oral account, validated by a body of evidence
from multiple sources – including the earliest British reports about
Singapore by Raffles, no less – now reveals that it was the coming
together of many, and not just the brilliance of one man, that sparked the
Singapore miracle.
