#### Introduction
The Chinese society of Singapore in the 19th century was by and large,
a transient community, comprising mostly Chinese immigrants from China.
The majority of Chinese immigrants were males who had come to “Nanyang”
in search of employment or to trade. Many of them left their families in
China or eventually returned to China when they earned enough. With the
lifting of the ban on general emigration by the Qing government in 1893,
the number of Chinese immigrants increased significantly. Some of them
brought their families along. In the year 1901 alone, 8,060 female immigrants
arrived in Singapore. It was also towards this time that local Chinese
births doubled from 1,076 to 2,203 between 1887 and 1900.[^1] This was
not merely a quantitative change within the Chinese community. With the
increase in the number of females and children in the community, there
were also fundamental changes in the nature of the community. The newly
formed family units brought about an increasing need for social institutions,
including schools for their children.

The early 20th century was a time of uncertainty and great changes for
China. The Qing Dynasty, in its attempt to sustain the imperial regime,
instituted a series of changes, including the modernisation of China’s
education system. It was during this period that China started to transform
its schools. Many scholars have elucidated on how education reforms in
China had shaped similar initiatives of the Chinese overseas. The matter
may be more complex and one can examine the reality of the matter by taking
a closer look at the actual situation in Singapore, in particular, through
the curriculum and school textbooks used by the local modern vernacular
schools.

#### At The Dawn of Modern Vernacular Chinese Education
Up till the time when modern Chinese vernacular schools were founded in
the first decade of the 20th century, Chinese classical texts like the
Trimetrical Classics (Sanzijing), the Hundred Families Surnames (Baijiaxing)
and the Millenary Classics (Qianziwen) were known to have been used in
the local Chinese schools.[^2] This was first noticed by Khoo Seok Wan
(1874–1941), “a man of enlightened views”, according to Song Ong Siang.[^3]
Khoo was born in China and came to Singapore with his father when he was
just seven years old.[^4] In 1888, he returned to China to prepare for
the Imperial Examinations. Six years later, he took part in the Imperial
Examinations and was awarded the title of Ju Ren. Though educated in the
Chinese classics, Song Ong Siang also described Khoo as “a man … strongly
in sympathy with the revolutionary movement in China”.[^5]

Evidence of this “strong sympathy” was his involvement in the founding
of the Singapore Chinese Girls’ Schools in 1899. He donated $3,000 towards
the establishment of this school of the Straits Chinese, an act which Song
felt was “worthy [of] more than [just] a passing mention, for at that time”,[^6]
the leading Straits Chinese were “apathetic, if not inimical, to the cause
of female education and refused to contribute anything”.[^7] Khoo did not
just contribute financially to such education efforts. He spearheaded early
syllabus reforms too. Khoo had noticed that classical texts, such as the
Millenary Classics (Qianziwen), used in many old-style private teaching
(si shu) at that time, were too difficult for young students. He found
that too many obscure words were used in the Millenary Classics and students
who studied it for many years ended up still not being able to write their
own names, compose simple letters or grasp the rudiments of the Chinese
language. Hence, he concluded that if the teachers clung on to tradition
and persisted in using these textbooks, it would ultimately be detrimental
to the students.[^8]

<div style="background-color: white;">Thousand Characters Textbook for Public Education). (1940). <i>Shanghai: The Commercial Press.</i></div>

In 1902, Khoo selected 479 characters from the original text and added
another 521 more commonly used words to form a new Millenary Classics (Xin
Chu Qiziwen). As Khoo was a talented poet, he put this poetic flair to
good use when he put these 1,000 characters into 52 sentences, each with
four characters. The sentences were grouped into eight chapters. The topics
in these chapters ranged from teaching students how to recognise items
from every day life and at the same time, instilling values in them.[^9]
This new Millenary Classics is the earliest known existing textbook produced
locally for elementary education in Singapore.[^10]

As the winds of modernisation garnered greater momentum at the turn of
the 20th century, the major Chinese dialectal communities founded several
modern Chinese schools in Singapore. The Cantonese founded the Yeung Ching
School (Yangzheng Xuetang) in 1905. The next year, the Hakkas set up Yingxin
School and Khee Fatt School (Qifa Xuetang).[^11] In 1906, the Toh Lam School
(Daonan Xuetang) and the Tuan Mong School (Duan Meng Xuetang) were founded
by the Hokkiens and the Teochews respectively.[^12] As for the Hainanese,
they too started a modern school, Yoke Eng School (Yu Ying Xuetang), for
their children in 1910.[^13]

Although the syllabi and teaching styles of these schools have not been
thoroughly documented, it is certain that they were not old-style schools
(si shu). It was during this time that the 1911 Revolution in China also
resulted in fundamental change in the socio-political culture for China.
This new phrase of China’s journey towards modernity affected all Chinese,
including those abroad. For the Chinese overseas, it was through their
institutions like schools that the trappings of modernity first took root.
The Hokkien merchants of Singapore were among the first to push for change.
They advocated revising and bringing up-to-date the teaching at Toh Lam
School and other old-style schools, according to the “new rules and regulations
of the Chinese Ministry of Education”.[^14] This is one of the first examples
of how the Chinese in Singapore attempted to follow China’s education model.
Eventually, the resultant form of vernacular Chinese education in Singapore
also included the considerations of socio-political and economic realities
of early 20th century Singapore. Even when they acquired textbooks from
China, the China printers normally had a “Nanyang” edition of their publications
that incorporated local “needs” and “conditions”.[^15] China also recognised
this difference and even set up special colleges such as the Jinan Da Xue
(Chi-Nan University) to train teachers specifically for Chinese schools
in Nanyang.[^16]

#### The Colonial Government and Textbooks for Local Needs
After 1911, most of the colonial governments in Southeast Asia grew apprehensive
of the political influences from China. In the Straits Settlements, the
Colonial authorities passed the School Registration Ordinance of 1920.
It heralded British direct involvement with the education of all children
in Singapore. They were concerned no longer just with the English-stream
schools and Malay vernacular schools.

With this Ordinance, the local government sought to “gain control over
all schools in the Colony”. The government officially declared three points:

Firstly, that the schools shall be properly conducted as schools; secondly,
that the teachers in them have efficient training for teaching, and thirdly,
that the teaching shall not be of such a kind that is against the interest
of the Government of the Colony.[^17]

Under this Ordinance, both the managers and teachers of all schools were
required to register with the Education Department within three months,
for existing schools, and one month for new schools. In addition, any changes
in the teaching staff or committee of management of the registered schools
had to be reported to the Education Department within one month. Every
registered school was also to be opened to inspections by the Director
of Education and he was empowered to declare schools unlawful if the schools,
the teachers or the managers were found to be involved in political propaganda
detrimental (or prejudicial) to the interests of the Colony.[^18]

To ensure that the objectives of the Ordinance were met, the Ordinance
and the General Regulations were repeatedly amended to make them more effective.
The first amendment to the Ordinance was made in 1925 and it was amended
again in the following year to make it even more stringent. The General
Regulations were also revised for the same purpose.[^19] In addition to
legislation, the Straits Settlements Education Department also started
writing textbooks for use in the Chinese schools in the 1920s.

<div style="background-color: white;">New Chinese Language Textbook. (1927). <i>Shanghai: The Commercial Press.</i></div>

In 1923, the British Education Department explored the possibility of
compiling textbooks locally, which would be suited to local needs.[^20]
The preparation of the books was slightly delayed, but by 1925, it was
reported that “primary school readers and text-books on hygiene and geography
with appropriate reference to local conditions” were in the course of preparation.[^21]
This task was continued for another two years until 1927, when “a series
of readers for Chinese Schools was nearly completed and arrangements to
have them printed were under discussion at the close of the year.” When
the compilation of a geography reader was nearing completion, there were
plans to compile other manuals on arithmetic and hygiene.[^22] Approval
was soon given for the publication of a trial edition of these locally
written Readers by a local firm in 1928.[^23] However, it appears that
these textbooks were hardly used in the Chinese vernacular schools. From
1929 onwards, the <em>Straits Settlements Annual Reports</em> reported, “practically
all the text-books used in Chinese schools are published and printed in
Shanghai”.[^24]

#### Survey of Modern Chinese Textbooks Used in Local Schools
The Chinese textbooks that were used in these modern schools in Singapore
covered a wide range of subjects. Students were taught Chinese (Guo Wen
Guo Yu), English (Ying Yu ፞J), Letter-writing (Chi Du), Mathematics (Suan
Shu), Abacus (Zhu Suan), Geography (Di Li), History (Li Shi), Science (Ke
Xue), General Knowledge (Chang Shi), Nature Study (Zi Ran), Hygiene (Wei
Sheng), Moral Education (Gong Min), Arts (Mei Shu), Music (Yin Yue) and
Sports Education (Ti Yu). The range of subjects instructed in each school
varied, depending on the resources of individual schools. Nevertheless,
from the textbooks that survived till today, we could see that the schools
of that period provided their students with a modern education, one that
differed greatly from the old-style private teaching where the students
recited the lines of the Confucian classics after their teachers and committed
these texts to memory.

An examination of the textbooks on these subjects showed that they broke
away from the traditional curricula (ie. the Confucian classics) and were
similar to the Western tradition of education. Learning took place on a
progressive path. In the case of languages, students were introduced to
basic words when they first enrolled in schools and were exposed to a larger
corpus of words as they advanced. We could see this in both the Chinese
and English language textbooks. Students at the elementary levels were
first taught individual words or phrases and as they moved up, their language
lessons comprised sentences and paragraphs.[^25] Likewise for subjects
like Mathematics, simple concepts such as counting, addition and subtraction
were taught before the students learned about multiplication and division.
For the students in higher levels, they were introduced to specialised
branches of mathematics such as Algebra, Geometry and Trigonometry.[^26]
A similar approach was also applied to subjects like History and Geography.[^27]

<div style="background-color: white;">Abacus for Upper-primary Schools. (1938), vols. 1–4. Distributed by: <i>The World Book Co., Singapore.</i></div>

Besides the subjects above, practical subjects that helped the students
secure jobs after they graduated were also taught. There were textbooks
on Abacus and Letter-writing. Equipped with the knowledge of how to use
the abacus, students could work as book keeping clerks in shops and even
within English establishments. Letter-writing lessons showed the students
how to draft simple correspondences should their future work require so.[^28]

<div style="background-color: white;">Letter-writing for Upper Primary Nanyang Schools. (1941), vol. 1. Distributed by: <i>The World Book Co., Singapore.</i></div>

Students were also inculcated with general knowledge about the world they
lived in. General Knowledge, Nature Study and Hygiene textbooks explained
the changes in housing as human beings evolved (from the caves to the trees
and eventually houses), parts of a plant and how they pollinate, organs
of a modern government (parliament, constitutions, courts, etc), various
types of transportation, personal hygiene to prevent the spreading of germs
and many other issues.[^29]

<div style="background-color: white;">Nature Study for Upper Primary Schools. (1939), vol. 2. Distributed by: <i>The World Book Co., Singapore.</i></div>

Besides the textbooks above, there were also textbooks that instilled
values to mould and shape one’s character. Moral Education, Art and Music
were taught in schools too.[^30] In Moral Education, values that were perpetuated
in the Confucian texts such as respect to the elders, good behaviour, cherish
public property, care for another person and other similar subject matters
were taught. Art and music lessons were held to teach students how to appreciate
fine arts and music. Students also learned teamwork and keeping good health
through sports.

While it appears that the modern Chinese education before 1941 had retained
certain cultural and moral values of the old tradition, by and large, from
the curriculum and textbooks used in the schools, we can deduce that Chinese
education in Singapore had evolved into a modern form. Besides the influences
from the changes and practices in China and in the English schools, some
Chinese in Singapore had also taken the lead themselves, just as Khoo had
shown the way.

#### Conclusion: Sources and Location
Studies on the education of the Chinese communities overseas have often
been carried out within the framework of examining education policies and
politics of China and that of the local governments. By examining other
local events and factors, a more exact picture of the Chinese modern education
in Singapore could be mapped out.

Firstly, from the efforts of Khoo, we can see that Chinese education in
Singapore did not entirely follow China’s lead. Besides Khoo, there were
many like-minded individuals who played an active role in setting up schools
for the Chinese community in Singapore. These school founders were propelled
by the need to educate their youngsters and it was this need that drove
them to chart out an education that was best suited to the environment
here. They had to ensure that the curriculum taught were not just propagation
of tradition values but included practical skills and modern values, which
would equip the students adequately to face the challenges of the “modern
world”.

Currently in Singapore, besides private individuals, several institutions
are known to have collections of these textbooks used before 1941. These
institutions include: the National University of Singapore Chinese Library,
Singapore History Museum, Chinese Heritage Centre, Singapore Federation
of Chinese Clans Associations and the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library
of the National Library, Singapore.

Due to the antiquarian nature of these books, they are generally not available
to the public. Nevertheless, these institutions have opened their collection
to the public in other ways. For example, in 2003, when the Chinese Heritage
Centre received a donation of Chinese-school textbooks, periodicals, school
magazines and school publications published between 1912 and 1960s, from
an Indonesia-Chinese, Professor Eddy Hermawan,[^31] the Centre organised
an exhibition titled “Grooming Future Generations Through Education: Chinese-School
Textbooks in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia before 1965”, in 2003. Items
from the National Library’s collection and private individuals were also
showcased at the exhibition.

Since the opening of the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library at Victoria
Street in 2005, the Library has received numerous donations, including
several hundreds volumes of textbooks. A selection of these textbooks will
be displayed at the National Library’s newly created Donors Gallery in
appreciation of the generous donations from the various individuals. Opening
in November 2007, the Gallery is located at Level 10 of the National Library.
These donated materials are available for consultation upon request at
the Information Counter located at Level 11. Library patrons may search
