#### Microfilming the National Library’s collections began in the 1950s to preserve and archive Singapore’s documentary heritage. The collection includes newspapers; rare and out-of-print books; periodicals and directories; government publications; and dissertations.

Microfilming the National Library’s collections began in the 1950s. It was initiated as a move to preserve and archive Singapore’s documentary heritage. Beginning with a collection of old newspapers and manuscripts, microfilming activities was stepped up to include the filming of government records, as well as rare and out-of-print Singapore materials.

Over the years, this collection was further enhanced through the addition of titles acquired from the British Library, Malaysian libraries, National University of Singapore Library, University Microfilms International and the Library of Congress. Today, the collection has grown to an extensive archive of 24,000 microfilm reels and 12,500 fiches that forms an integral part of the Singapore and Southeast Asian collections at the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library.

The collection, housed at Level 11 of the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library, is an invaluable and rich resource to many users, from the researcher of Singapore history, the student conducting social and business research, the heritage seeker pouring through Singapore’s earliest imprints and Jawi manuscripts, to the individual tracing his family roots.

The microform collection can be broadly categorised into newspapers, rare and out-of-print books, periodicals and directories, government publications and dissertations.
