#### From the first smallpox vaccine introduced in 1819 to the nationwide Covid-19 vaccination programme now underway, **Ong Eng Chuan** provides a quick history of vaccination efforts in Singapore since colonial times.

The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has cast vaccination into the spotlight as it helps to prevent the disease and reduce its spread. Being vaccinated is not a new concept in Singapore though. Most children here routinely get vaccinated against diseases such as measles and mumps.

Vaccinations for children are done under National Childhood Immunisation Schedule which is overseen by the Ministry of Health (MOH). It covers diseases such as tuberculosis, diphtheria, hepatitis B, measles, pertussis (whooping cough), pneumococcal infection, poliomyelitis, rubella (German measles) and tetanus. It does not stop with children either. Many adults take the influenza (flu) vaccine, especially before travelling to colder climates, as well as the pneumococcal and hepatitis B vaccines. The elderly and people with certain chronic conditions are strongly advised to have the flu jab regularly.

The highly organised way in which the Health Ministry handles the schedule for childhood vaccinations makes it seems like a very modern medical practice. However, vaccinations in Singapore actually have a long history. The very first vaccine – for smallpox – was introduced as early as December 1819.
