#### A look back at John Little’s 170-year history and the lasting mark the store has made on our island.
By Yap Jo Lin

Of all the department stores in Singapore, none has had a longer history than John Little. In all, John Little lasted 174 years; it opened its doors in 1842 and closed its last store at Plaza Singapura in 2016. At one point, John Little had locations all over Singapore, including Specialists’ Shopping Centre (Orchard Gateway today) and Marina Square.

One of its most enduring contributions was to Singapore’s city scape in the form of its iconic building at Raffles Place. While the Singapore Land Tower now stands in its place, details of the building’s façade have been reproduced at the entrances of Raffles Place Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) Station.

<b>John Little’s Beginnings</b><br>
The John Little department store got its start in 1842 when Scotsman John Martin Little joined the Raffles Place business of his relative Francis S. Martin, who was a storekeeper and auctioneer. 
In 1845, Martin exited the company, leaving it in the hands of Little and a Parsi gentleman named Cursetjee Frommurzee. The company changed its name to Little, Cursetjee &amp; Co.[^1] During this time, Cursetjee brought a gentleman from Australia into the fold. This gentleman was Philip Robinson, who eventually went on to establish rival department store Robinsons (which bought over John Little in 1955).[^2]

The Little-Cursetjee partnership was dissolved in 1853, and John Little teamed up with his younger brother Matthew Little and renamed the company John Little &amp; Co.[^3] The brothers eventually retired in the UK; John left Singapore in the 1860s and died in Blackheath, south London in 1894, while Matthew moved to Hampstead in north London in 1877 and died in 1902.[^4]

**A New Storefront at Raffles Place**

Notwithstanding the exit of the Little brothers from the company, the department store continued to thrive and in 1895, the architecture firm Swan &amp; Maclaren was commissioned to design a new storefront for their Raffles Place premises. Architectural historian Julian Davison suggests in his history of Swan &amp; Maclaren that John Little’s impetus for change could have been competition from the Katz Brothers, another department store that was setting up its flagship store at Raffles Place around the same time.[^5]

John Little’s new storefront featured domed pavilions on either side with a “sawn-off” top – meaning that the domes were not perfectly round or sloping at the top. The domes also had dormer windows, or windows that jut out vertically from a sloping plane.

The building plan of the new storefront was titled “Proposed Alterations to Messrs John Little &amp; Coy’s Godown”, interestingly referring to a godown rather than a store or shop. While the term “godown” is associated with a warehouse today, Davison explains that earlier godowns were sometimes multipurpose, storing goods on the ground floor, with offices or reception areas on their upper levels. This was both practical and for security – in the days of the East India Company, godowns also included accommodation that allowed staff to keep an eye on their goods around the clock. In the case of John Little, its godown was for the storage and sale of goods.[^6]

<b>Rebuilding John Little</b><br>
Swan &amp; Maclaren were called upon again in 1908 to completely rebuild the Raffles Place premises. Among other things, the new building would be taller, and the columns and archways on the ground floor were arranged differently. The columns were more widely spaced and the arches between them were less steep, creating a more open feel that invited passers-by to look at the window displays. The <i>Straits Times</i> reported that the passageway outside the building was a spacious 11 ft (3 m) wide, allowing for much more foot traffic than the average shophouse five-foot way.[^7]

Another prominent feature of the new building was the gable, a triangular portion of wall with sloped roofs on either side. John Little’s new building had a gable that stretched 65 ft (19 m) across three bays of the façade, reaching a height of 93 ft (28 m) above ground.[^8] Details of the gable have been replicated at the entrances to Raffles Place MRT Station as a nod to the iconic building.
