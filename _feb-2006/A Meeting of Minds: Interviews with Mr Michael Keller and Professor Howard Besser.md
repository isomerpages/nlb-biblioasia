#### Mr Michael Keller is University Librarian and Director of Academic Information Resources at Stanford University, while Professor Howard Besser is Director of Moving Image Archive and Preservation Program, New York University’s Tisch School of Arts. Both men spoke at the _Celebrating Knowledge: The Power and Potential_ conference held at the InterContinental Hotel from 13 to 15 November 2005.

**Mr Michael Keller**

**BiblioAsia: Mr Keller, how would you define a knowledge-based web?**

Michael Keller:The knowledge-based web is a multi-dimensional matrix and this matrix consists of knowledge, information, facts, and data that are recorded in published or written works that may appear in only digital form, available in the public Internet or in the private Internet. The matrix also includes knowledge, information, facts, and data that are transmitted orally from one person to others. The knowledge-based web is a multi-faceted knowledge machine that helps to facilitate precise retrieval of knowledge. It realigns itself to work in the information context.

**BiblioAsia: You say that the knowledge-web will consist of, partly, published and written works. What then are the implications for the knowledge-based web when strict intellectual property (lP) laws are in place? Take for instance the Google Library project.**

Michael Keller:The issue of intellectual property is a huge concern. We understand IP rules are in place to protect creators and their creativity. For example, a book is an author's original work. The book is copyrighted and these copyrights cannot be violated. What we can do is to convince the right holders that there is a benefit in making their works available to the world.

In the case of the Google Library project, Google and the five libraries involved \[Harvard, Stanford, the University of Michigan, the University of Oxford, andThe New York Public Library\] are not violating the laws. We do not seek to make available the entire content of a book but just a small portion of it. The publishers were unhappy because they will not be rewarded monetarily through this project. They see the project as a way of making profits and yet they are not able to benefit from it.

However, we have to understand that society has nurtured these authors and this is a form of payback to society. Besides, the publishers do not stand to lose as the project can bring about awareness of the books and interest the search user to purchase them.
