####  A 1607 map by Theodore de Bry shows a close-up view of Singapore and the surrounding region. The map depicts the Dutch-Portuguese naval confrontation that took place in October 1603, in the eastern side of Singapore around the estuary of the Johor River.

Singapore was founded in 1819 by Sir Stamford Raffles. Was the name 'Singapore' in existence prior to 1819? Many ancient maps revealed that Singapore did exist as far back as the 16th century. It was then mentioned directly or indirectly in several non-English European ancient maps under different variations of the name, such as:<br><br>

a) ***Cinca pula*** in Giacomo Gastaldi's map "*India Tercera Nova Tabula*" on Southeast Asia of 1548, which shows ***C Cinca Pula*** (Cape of Singapore);<br>
b) ***Cim capula*** in G. B. Ramusio's map "*Terza Ostro Tavola*" on Southeast Asia of 1563, which indicates the location of ***C. de cim capula***; <br>
c) ***Cincapura***, in Gerard Mercator's world map of 1569, and in Abraham Ortelius's map of Southeast Asia "*Indiae orientalis insularumque adiacientium typus*" of 1570;<br>
d) ***Sincapura***, in Jan Huygen van Linschoten's 1595 map of Southeast Asia, China and Japan, "*Exacta et accurata delineatio cum orarum maritinarum*..", and in E.G. de Eredia's map, "*Discripsao chorogrpaphica dos estreitos de Sincapura e Sabbam Ano, 1604*";<br>
e) ***Sincapour*** in S.R. Bellin's map, "*Carte reduite des Detroits de Malaca, Sincapour, et du Gouveneeur Dresse au Depost des Cartes et Plans de la Marine*" of 1755.
