In 1952, four Singapore artists – Liu Kang, Chen Chong Swee, Chen Wen Hsi and Cheong Soo Pieng – visited Java and Bali to seek inspiration. Their trip led to an exhibition held the next year that has been hailed as a major milestone in Singapore’s art history. Despite this, few details of the trip were ever revealed. _Bali 1952_ showcases more than 250 black-and-white photographs taken by Liu Kang during the seven-week adventure. These photographs, most of which have never been seen, tell the story of a remarkable journey that has left a lasting legacy on Singapore’s art history.

Recent discoveries and improved investigative techniques reveal that the first modern humans reached Southeast Asia at least 60,000 years ago. They encountered not two, but four different human species and interbred with at least one of them. Early Southeast Asia provides a synthesis of nearly two million years of human endeavour.
