In evangelical Christian circles, the trope of Singapore as the “Antioch of Asia” has routinely been deployed in triumph to describe the city-state’s unique role in spreading the Christian gospel across Asia in the 20th and 21st centuries. (The Roman city of Antioch played a central role in the spread of Christianity in the 4th century CE).1 This idea of Singapore as a “Christian Capital,” as Robbie Goh argues, is not simply one of financial capital flows, but equally about how Christian agencies strategically cultivate transnational influences to produce an international “brand” of Singapore Christianity. 

Historians of religious flows in colonial Southeast Asia have noted how Singapore, as a maritime Asian port, was, at least since the 19th century, equally a hub for missionary and religious movements in Asia.2 Whereas sociologists of religion have focused on how the globalisation of Christianity in the 1980s – with the rise of evangelical megachurches, charismatic leaders and aggressive social services – ¬shaped this identity as a Christian hub, historical scholarship has pointed towards the colonial era as another moment where British imperialism, colonial port networks and modernity, were crucial to shaping Singapore as a hub of Christian missions.3

Comparatively, the mid-century geopolitical transformations of Singapore’s decolonisation and role in the Cold War have been overlooked, even though its influence has been keenly felt in local Christian communities. Works of local church history like Bobby Sng’s *In His Good Time*, note the unmistakable role of “China-oriented (missionary) organizations,” which left China after the communist revolution of 1949, and sought to continue their work among the “10 million people of Chinese origin in Southeast Asia.”4

As Sng notes, this missionary mass migration – comprising mission organisations completely new to Singapore – indelibly shaped the trajectory of a new generation of churches in Singapore by staffing their leadership and providing financial support at a crucial time. However, despite their subsequent contributions to nation-building, these former China missionaries never saw their role in Singapore initially as solely supporting the local church. The expansion of their work into Singapore in the 1950s was closely tied with attempts to cultivate a hub to expand influence across the region as one node within a broader regional network.

This essay draws attention to how Protestant missionaries exiled from China after 1949 envisioned and cultivated Singapore as a “Chinese Christian Hub” in Cold War Asia, where they could sponsor new institutions to continue their missions. On one level, it attempts to answer the question – how did the missionary exodus from China shape Christianity in Singapore? At the same time, it also reveals how missionaries who arrived in Singapore were less concerned with local conditions and politics than they were looking for a “hub” in Free Asia where they could continue their work – chiefly among the overseas Chinese, whom they believed to share a particular cultural affinity. 

Drawing on published resources held at the National Library Singapore’s Lee Kong Chian Research Library and the microfilm archives of the Conference for British Missionary Societies and International Missionary Council held at the National Archives of Singapore (NAS), this essay reveals the interactions between local Christians and ex-China missionaries in Singapore during the 1950s, and explores the extent to which missionaries reshaped the trajectories of local institutions, even as local elites leveraged missionary resources for their own agendas.

In answering these questions, this essay focuses on the establishment of two Christian Colleges: Singapore’s Trinity College (later Trinity Theological College, TTC) and Singapore Theological Seminary (later Singapore Bible College, SBC), both of which were sites for reproducing and cultivating clergy and lay-leadership for the church. Although subsequently memorialised as local institutions, these two colleges were initially intended as regional hubs for missionary work in the region and were enabled by a transnational web of affiliated institutions and personnel with American missionaries exiled from China. 

In addition, they reveal divisions between two key groups of Christian elites – Western ecumenical missionaries and Chinese evangelicals – whose debates reveal multiple visions for Christian futures in postwar Singapore. Existing writings on the role of ex-China missionaries in 1950s Singapore and Malaya have focused extensively on the context of the Malayan Emergency, the anticommunist war, and the “Malayan New Villages,” which relied on the clandestine recruitment of a huge network of ex-China missionaries to staff the colonial government’s resettlement and development work among the rural Chinese.5 (During the Malayan Emergency (1948-60), colonial authorities resettled half a million rural dwellers in Malaya, mainly Chinese, to cut them off from the activities of the Malayan Communist Party.6) However, given the role of Singapore as a coordination center for this missionary activity and the emergence of both colleges as a site for reproducing Asian Christian elites, I argue that the education and clergy-training was a significant but overlooked site of Christian missions in Singapore.

From the outset, it is necessary to clarify the distinctions between the Christian College and Christian higher education, which has myriad meanings, including universities established by Christian missionaries, Christians engaging in academic or religious activities within secular institutions, and seminaries offering advanced degrees for clergy training.7 In this essay, I follow Joel Carpenter’s definition of “Christian Colleges” as institutions acknowledging or embracing a Christian identity and purpose in their mission and shaping aspects of their governance, curriculum, staffing, student body and campus life while acknowledging that both Trinity College and the Singapore Bible College, by the mid-1950s, were predominantly offering theological studies, with a stated mission of training clergy and lay-leaders for the church.

In this essay, I first situate the Cold War missionary exodus from China as part of a longer trajectory of religious mobilities and circulations between maritime South China and Southeast Asia, where Chinese Christianity was a significant part. Next, I introduce the process through which multiple Christian mission boards and Chinese Christian elites converged on Singapore as a space to found new institutions with commitments to cultivating a new generation of Christian clergy in postcolonial and Cold War Asia. 

While this missionary exodus was trans-denominational and affected a whole range of actors from Seventh Day Adventists, Pentecostals, nondenominational fundamentalists and evangelicals, I focus chiefly on Trinity College and Singapore Theological Seminary to reveal tensions between Western ecumenical missionaries and Chinese evangelicals in 1950s Singapore, and the possibilities of Singapore as a Christian hub in Asia. 

Both institutions were products of the 1950s, inseparable from the mass migrations of Christian missionaries out of China following the 1949 Chinese revolution and attendant interest in the Chinese diaspora in Free Asia as a counterweight to communist China. In addition, both relied heavily on U.S. funding and institutional relationships with American and British mission boards in their initial years, although those ties came separately from ecumenical Protestants (at Trinity College) and evangelicals (at Singapore Bible College).
