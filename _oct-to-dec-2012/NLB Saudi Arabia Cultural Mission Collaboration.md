The Saudi Arabia Cultural Mission (SACM) in Singapore was established in 2008 under the umbrella of the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia in Singapore to strengthen the friendly relations between Saudi Arabia and Singapore. Since its establishment, the Cultural Mission has organised more than 10 cultural visits between the two countries and supported numerous cultural and educational events by Singapore. The Cultural Mission has also facilitated joint scientific research between the universities of both countries.

Building on these warm ties and mutual exchanges, the SACM and the National Library Board (NLB) of Singapore signed a memorandum of understanding in September 2012 to provide a framework for closer collaboration. This tie-up will see a donation of 200 publications to the NLB by the SACM. To mark the start of this partnership, a series of programmes for the public was organised to showcase the arts and culture of Saudi Arabia. The activities will run from September 2012 to August 2013, and are jointly curated by the Saudi Arabia Cultural Office and the NLB. This synergy serves to promote greater sharing of resources, expertise and networks for content creation about Saudi Arabia. The proposed lineup of events was planned around significant occasions such as Saudi Arabia Day, Saudi Arabia’s Student Day, the International Summit of the Book and the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions' World Library and Information Congress.
