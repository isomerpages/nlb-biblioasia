#### <a href="/vol-11/issue-2/jul-sep-2015/stories" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">Living the Singapore Story: Celebrating Our 50 Years (1965−2015) </a>
This book contains 50 specially curated items from the Rare Materials Collection, researched and written by a team of librarians from the National Library. Each article in this book contains a detailed description of the rare item as well as highlights of its history and provenance. Distilling 50 items from a 19,000-strong collection was a challenging task, and the final selection is at best only a representative snapshot of the complete repository.

*The Singapore House* by Lee Kip Lin is a comprehensive study of the various domestic architectural styles that thrived in Singapore from 1819 until the outbreak of the Pacific War – from English, Georgian, Victorian, Eclectic, Edwardian, Baroque, Arts and Crafts and Modern International to the home-grown Coarsened Classical. Beautifully illustrated, *The Singapore House* marks a major attempt to document a rich and beautiful architectural legacy. The over 400 illustrations include rare historical materials, remarkable photographs and fascinating architectural drawings.

In 2009 the family of the late Lee Kip Lin donated to the National Library Board of Singapore over 14,500 slides and negatives of modern Singapore that he had taken, among other items of historical merit such as maps, rare photographs and prints, and books. Over three decades from 1965 to 1995, Lee captured the many landscapes and buildings that would eventually disappear from the island and its shores. Close to 500 photographs have been reproduced in this book to showcase the exuberance and eloquence of the different built forms – in an era when time and space in Singapore was more accommodating.
