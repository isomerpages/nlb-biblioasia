When we reached the bottom of the ship, I looked around me astonished,
astonished, astonished, and no words will suffice, for I saw the magic
[<i>hikmat</i>] of those steam machines [<i>pesawat asap</i>]. Six to seven fathoms of
space were taken up by them alone! And I saw several people wiping, sweeping,
oiling and polishing the iron and brasswork until they gleamed like mirrors.
I saw nothing rusty, rough or dented, everything was smooth and shiny.1
