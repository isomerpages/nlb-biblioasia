**About**:	The reading club is dedicated to fostering a love of reading amongst incarcerated individuals, recognising literature as a powerful tool for personal transformation and intellectual development. Through carefully structured reading programmes, participants learn to think critically, develop self-affirmation and confidence, and expand their knowledge base. The initiative also helps them correct misconceptions and develop positive perspectives towards society.
