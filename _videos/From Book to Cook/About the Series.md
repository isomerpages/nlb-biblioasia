#### Series summary
<i>From Book to Cook</i> is the cooking show on Singaporeâ€™s food history. We recreate recipes dating as far back as a century ago, found in the National Library collection. What happens when you put a librarian in the kitchen, armed with traditional kitchen tools and recipes from the past? Catch the series to find out what old recipes can tell us about local history and food heritage.
