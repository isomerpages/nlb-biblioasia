#### From the first smallpox vaccine introduced in 1819 to the nationwide Covid-19 vaccination programme now underway, **Ong Eng Chuan** provides a quick history of vaccination efforts in Singapore since colonial times.

The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has cast vaccination into the spotlight as it helps to prevent the disease and reduce its spread. Being vaccinated is not a new concept in Singapore though. Most children here routinely get vaccinated against diseases such as measles and mumps.

Vaccinations for children are done under National Childhood Immunisation Schedule which is overseen by the Ministry of Health (MOH). It covers diseases such as tuberculosis, diphtheria, hepatitis B, measles, pertussis (whooping cough), pneumococcal infection, poliomyelitis, rubella (German measles) and tetanus. It does not stop with children either. Many adults take the influenza (flu) vaccine, especially before travelling to colder climates, as well as the pneumococcal and hepatitis B vaccines. The elderly and people with certain chronic conditions are strongly advised to have the flu jab regularly.

The highly organised way in which the Health Ministry handles the schedule for childhood vaccinations makes it seems like a very modern medical practice. However, vaccinations in Singapore actually have a long history. The very first vaccine – for smallpox – was introduced as early as December 1819.

##### **Smallpox and Vaccination in Early Singapore**
Until fairly recently, smallpox, which is caused by the variola virus, was a much-feared disease. It was highly contagious, had a high mortality rate and those who survived were often disfigured for life. Thanks to a concerted global campaign of vaccination, smallpox was eventually eradicated, and in October 1979, the World Health Organization (WHO) finally declared the world free of the disease.1
The first step towards eradicating smallpox began in 1796 when English doctor Edward Jenner used cowpox (a milder form of smallpox) to induce immunity against the more virulent smallpox.2 This smallpox vaccine was the first vaccine to be introduced in Singapore. 
In December 1819, Resident of Singapore William Farquhar wrote to officials in Penang to request for supplies of smallpox vaccine.3 The vaccine was sent to Singapore and a Vaccine Department set up to administer the vaccination. However, this early attempt at a vaccination programme failed, and the Vaccine Department was abolished in 1829. Subsequent efforts also produced erratic outcomes and as a result, smallpox remained prevalent in Singapore, periodically breaking out into epidemic proportions, such as the 1838 episode which claimed hundreds of lives.4 
These early vaccination programmes faltered due to the resistance from the local population.5 Few residents came forth to be vaccinated and parents were also unwilling to send their healthy children to be vaccinated for fear of putting them at risk. 
In its early form, vaccination was done using arm-to-arm transfer, getting pustular material from one vaccinated person to directly inoculate another person by scratching the material into the recipient’s arm.6 This method needed a constant stream of people to help propagate the vaccine.
It was hard to obtain fresh vaccine lymph or material when the supply ran out. As Penang and Singapore did not produce the smallpox vaccine, fresh material had to be shipped from Calcutta.7 However, the tropical climate made it difficult to maintain the shelf life of the vaccine so by the time the vaccines arrived here, their effectiveness would be compromised. 
The authorities made attempts to obtain vaccine lymph from other sources such as Batavia (now Jakarta) and the Royal Jennerian Institute in London (which would take six weeks to reach Singapore by ship), in the hope that these would give better results.[^8] 

In 1863, when the incidence of smallpox increased again, the government was urged to implement tougher measures, including making smallpox vaccination compulsory by law, following in the footsteps of the Dutch who had successfully introduced compulsory vaccination in the Dutch East Indies (present-day Indonesia).[^9] 

Stricter public health control measures were finally introduced after the Straits Settlements became a Crown Colony in 1867. The Quarantine Ordinance was passed by the Legislative Council in June 1868, followed by An Ordinance to Extend and Make Compulsory the Practice of Vaccination, which came into effect on 1 May 1869.[^10] 

The latter legislation led to the Ordinance for Registration of Births and Deaths of 1868. A register was necessary to keep track of the number of children to be vaccinated, and it was the responsibility of the Registrar to send notification to parents of newborns to vaccinate their children. It was also important to track deaths and their causes to gauge the success of the vaccination programme.[^11]

Smallpox continued to be a problem in Singapore up until the 1950s. After WHO declared the virus eradicated, Singapore amended the law so that from smallpox vaccination would no longer be required by law from March 1982.[^12]
