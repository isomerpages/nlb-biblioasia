Photography in Singapore has a long history dating back to 1843. The earliest photographs, or daguerrotypes, captured images on metal plates. Then, in 1851, the glass plate collodion process was introduced, which allowed photographs to be easily reproduced on albumen paper. This new technology was a breakthrough as it allowed photography to take off commercially.
