#### The Singapore Teachers’ Union wanted a clubhouse. They ended up building a housing estate. 
By Sharon Teng

Private residential estates like Opera Estate and Sennett Estate end up developing a strong sense of camaraderie over time as neighbours became friends. In Teachers’ Housing Estate, the special bond among residents was established quickly because most of the original homeowners in the area shared a similar profession – they were, as the name of the estate implies, teachers.

Located at the junction of Upper Thomson Road and Yio Chu Kang Road, Teachers’ Housing Estate came about thanks to the efforts of the Singapore Teachers’ Union (STU). The estate has a somewhat curious history: the primary reason for building it was because the union wanted to have a clubhouse for its members.

Work on the 20-acre site began in the late 1960s. When the estate was officially opened in 1971, about 70 percent of the 256 homes in the estate were owned by teachers. The clubhouse was built a few years later.
