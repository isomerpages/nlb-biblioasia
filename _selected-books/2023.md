From pioneering “city living” apartments in The Paterson Edge to weaving together the historic and contemporary in the restoration of the National Museum of Singapore, W Architects has built a reputation as one of the most respected architecture firms in Singapore today.

*To Draw an Idea: Retracing the Designs of William Lim Associates – W Architects* charts the design development of 19 key projects across its history and the evolution of the firm over the last four decades – from its founding in 1981 by pioneer local architect William S.W. Lim to its new chapter under Mok Wei Wei, who took over as managing director of the renamed firm in 2003.

This volume accompanies an exhibition organised as part of the Singapore Architecture Collection.

<i>From Keroncong to Xinyao</i> is a captivating exploration of Singapore’s vibrant record industry from the early 20th century to the mid-1980s. Researcher, collector and former sound archivist Ross Laird provides an in-depth look at the development of the industry as well as the extensive catalogue of recordings made during this period, revealing how Singapore was once a significant recording centre in Southeast Asia. 

The book highlights the multinational giants and first local record companies, the impact of World War II, the heyday of the 1960s and ‘70s and the industry’s eventual decline. The record industry was shaped through the efforts of its pioneers and innovators, from recording engineers to performing artists, as well as the advent of new technologies. This book presents a fascinating journey through the industry’s triumphs and challenges, charting its resonating contribution to Singapore’s cultural heritage.
