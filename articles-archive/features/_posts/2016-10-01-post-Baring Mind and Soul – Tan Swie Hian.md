<p>Tan Swie Hian’s notebooks offer an inkling into the thought processes
he engages in when creating his artworks. These pages show handwritten
notes and a sketch of his painting “Ode to Euphrates Poplar”. Donated by
Tan Swie Hian. <em>Collection of National Library, Singapore.</em>
</p>
<p>Journaling has been used by great artists since time immemorial. Michelangelo’s
notebooks are not only a priceless archive of his creative inspirations
but also offer a rare glimpse into his private life. From snippets of poetry,
random doodles and ethereal drawings to memos and practical listings of
food and expenses, the notebooks cast a light into the Italian master’s
inner world; the connections and juxtapositions of words and images divulge
the thinking and creative processes behind his works.[^1]</p>
<p>That same deep introspection, an intimate baring of the mind and soul
as it were, is similarly revealed in the private notebooks of Tan Swie
Hian, whom <em>Time</em> magazine proclaimed in 2003 as “Singapore’s Renaissance
man”.[^2] For those who are familiar with the works of Tan, this epithet
is a justifiably fitting tribute.</p>
<p>Now for the first time, the National Library, Singapore, presents the
acclaimed artist’s never-before-published notebooks as well as his celebrated
works of art and writings in an exhibition entitled “Anatomy of a Free
Mind: Tan Swie Hian’s Notebooks and Creations”. To be showcased at level
10 of the National Library Building, the exhibition opens its doors to
the public on 22 November 2016.</p>
<p>The notebooks, which Tan has since donated to the National Library, are
key to understanding the psyche and creative thinking of this much-lauded
artist. Containing sketches, drawings and writings, they are a window to
Tan’s formidable mind, which he describes as an “immense web with myriads
of beings hanging.”[^3] The exhibition aims to draw people into the unfettered
mind and soul of the artist, and reveal how his ideas, passions, philosophical
insights and spiritual enlightenment are manifested through his artistic
and literary creations.</p>
<p>Tan refers to his notebooks as his “secret garden”, and he is thus the
diligent and disciplined “gardener” who painstakingly and lovingly cultivates
and nurtures the seedlings of inspiration. So intrinsically important are
these notebooks that Tan considers them as his “companions in life”: they
never leave his side – they are stashed into his briefcase, they clutter
his desk and even his bedside.</p>
<p>The pages are filled from cover to cover, with almost every square inch
of space used for his creative musings – sketches of visions from his meditations,
drawings of his inner and outer realities, poetry verses, revisited memories,
reflections on his latest creations, annotations of ancient classical texts
he has read, and more.[^4]</p>
<p>To Tan, the notebooks serve the important purpose of documentation and
reference – as a cerebral artist he writes before, during or after the
execution of his works – and to the interested observer, they offer rare
vistas of the artist’s creative mindscape.</p>
<h4><strong>Singapore’s Renaissance Man</strong></h4>
<p>Tan Swie Hian was born in Indonesia in 1943 and moved to Singapore when
he was three. While as a student at the Chinese High School, Tan already
displayed his prodigious talents in art, calligraphy and poetry. He later
pursued a degree in Modern Languages and Literature at Nanyang University,
graduating in 1968. In the same year he published his first anthology,
The Giant – a collection of Chinese modernist poetry – a landmark work
that earned him recognition as a poet of standing.[^5] Since then, Tan
has published close to 40 collections of poetry, essays, novels, fables,
critiques and translated works.</p>
<p>The year 1973 was a turning point in Tan’s life: he received spiritual
illumination for the first time and deepened his faith in Buddhism. After
this metaphysical awakening, Tan channelled his creative energies into
the visual arts and took the path towards becoming an artist, expressing
himself through different media and genres. As a deeply religious person,
the tenets of Buddhist teachings are apparent in many of his works, which
often depict the spiritual insights and visions gleaned from his meditations.</p>
<p>As a polymath, Tan has a natural affinity for languages – he is proficient
in Mandarin, English, French and Malay – and is widely read, being well
versed in both Eastern and Western philosophic traditions. His creations
are therefore enriched by diverse cultural influences. Although deeply
steeped in Chinese artistic traditions, Tan straddles the visual languages
of the East and the West, freely fusing and experimenting with different
art forms in his work.</p>
<h4><strong>A String of Awards and Accolades</strong></h4>
<p>Tan has won a string of prestigious awards both locally – including the
Cultural Medallion in 1987, and the Meritorious Service Medal in 2003 for
his contributions to Singapore culture – and internationally. In 2003,
the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, conferred on Tan the Crystal
Award for his outstanding artistic achievements and contribution to cross-cultural
understanding. And in 2006, he received the Officier de l’Ordre National
de la Legion d’Honneur (Officer in the National Order of the Legion of
Honour) medal – France’s highest honour for individuals who have distinguished
themselves in civilian or military life.</p>
<p>Time and again, Tan’s paintings have made headline news as they set record
prices in art auctions.[^6] In December 2012, his oil and acrylic work,
“When the Moon is Orbed”, fetched an astounding RMB18.975 million (S$3.7
million) at a Beijing art auction.[^7] Barely two years later, his ink-on-rice-paper
painting, “Portrait of Bada Shanren”, went under the gavel for a record
RMB20.7 million (S$4.4 million) in Beijing.[^8] With this sale, Tan has
clearly made his name as the most expensive living artist in Southeast
Asia.</p>
<p>More recently in May 2016, a set of six lithographed sketches done by
former South African president Nelson Mandela – someone whom Tan greatly
admires – and painted over by the artist was sold for HK$3.52 million (S$630,000),
the highest-paid piece at an auction in Hong Kong. The images depict the
hands and arms of Mandela breaking free from manacles.[^9]</p>

<h4><strong>Anatomy of a Free Mind: The Exhibition</strong></h4>
<p>The works presented in “Anatomy of a Free Mind: Tan Swie Hian’s Notebooks
and Creations” reflect the full depth and diversity of Tan’s creative expressions.
Representing a considerable part of Tan’s oeuvre, the exhibition features
paintings, sculptures, public art, calligraphy, seal carvings, photographs,
lithographs, multimedia creations (dance choreographies, performances and
musical compositions) as well as his literary output (poetry, fables and
essays). To contextualise his works, the artist transcribed the notes and
writings from his notebooks – elucidating the rationale and thinking behind
each art piece – to be displayed alongside the works.</p>
<p>As an artist, much of Tan’s output is difficult to pin down and define:
versatility and freedom of expression are hallmarks of his works, and much
of it cannot be categorised into any particular subject, medium or genre.
While the body of works presented in this exhibition has its subtle interconnectedness,
a few themes stand out.</p>
<h4><strong>Tribute to Masters</strong></h4>
<p>Tan Swie Hian is deeply interested in people. He has painted many portraits
of personalities – in art, literature, politics and other fields – whom
he admires. In this exhibition, portraits and works paying tribute to some
of these luminaries can be seen: these include Pablo Picasso, Leonor Fini,
Bada Shanren (八大山人), Charlie Chaplin, Franz Kafka, Virginia Woolf, Steve
Jobs and Nelson Mandela, to name a few.</p>

<p>“Graffitied Portrait of Charlie Chaplin” (2013). Ink and acrylic on rice
paper, 226 cm x 105.4 cm. <em>Collection of Tan Swie Hian.</em>
</p>
<p>One of the paintings, titled “A Couple”, is an unusual portrayal of Lee
Kuan Yew, Singapore’s founding prime minister, and his wife as a young
couple quite obviously in love. The painting, inspired by a 1946 photograph
of the couple when they were law students in Cambridge University, England,
depicts Lee Kuan Yew and Kwa Geok Choo in the first blush of youth, and
exudes warmth and carefree pleasure – one can almost feel the sunshine
that bathes the couple in vibrant colour.</p>
<p>The portrait, which is devoid of any political undertones, is an ode to
a love that spanned over six decades. Tan began painting this portrait
on Valentine’s Day in 2009 and completed it only in 2014. When Kwa passed
away in October 2010, he added two Vanda Miss Joaquim orchids, Singapore’s
national flower, by her side as a tribute to the devoted mother and loving
wife.</p>

</p>
<h4><strong>Spiritual and Philosophical Insights</strong></h4>
<p>Perhaps Tan’s most enigmatic and intriguing works are those inspired by
his spiritual and philosophical enlightenment. While meditating one day
in September 2009, Tan had a vision in which he saw the full moon hovering
above the parted foliage of a tree reflected onto a still blue pond. He
quickly captured the vision in a sketch in his notebook. The ethereal scene
was eventually depicted in the oil and acrylic painting “When the Moon
is Orbed”.</p>

</p>
<p>The symbolism of the full moon is manifold: traditionally it represents
togetherness of people; but in Buddhism, it symbolises the clarity of the
mind and the enlightenment of a truth seeker. A smaller-scale reproduction
of this work is displayed at the exhibition.</p>

</p>
<p>The centrepiece of the exhibition is a unique mixed media sculpture entitled
“The Celestial Web”, a sizable dome-shaped structure made of coiled metal
wires adorned with “creatures” moulded from clay. The sculpture, inspired
by Tan’s Buddhist faith, is the embodiment of his perspective that all
beings, sentient and non-sentient, are interconnected by an immense web
of everlasting universal love.</p>
<p>Interestingly, “The Celestial Web” began life as a poem with 117 verses
that Tan specially composed for the Singapore Arts Festival in 2003. The
poem was inspired by the philosophical teachings in the Buddhist scripture
Avatamsaka Sutra, which espouses the notion that all beings in the universe
are interconnected and, are in fact, one. The poem was performed at the
festival’s opening act, “Instant is a Millennium – A Musical Conversation
with Tan Swie Hian”, by the Singapore Chinese Orchestra. The performance
took the form of a symphonic orchestration of recitation, chorus and music
with the artist simultaneously writing the poem in Chinese calligraphy
on stage.[^10]</p>

</p>
<p>The poem subsequently spawned the creation of two other art forms: an
oil painting (2003) and the aforementioned sculpture (2010) of the same
title. In the 2008 Chingay parade, the concept was reimagined, taking the
form of a 22-metre-long by six-metre-high mobile float featuring dancers
and a live recitation of the poem. Tan’s uncanny ability to reinvent and
morph his literary and artistic creations into other art forms is a distinguishing
trademark of his multimedia artworks.</p>
<h4><strong>Inspirations from Life</strong></h4>
<p>At the same time, one would be wrong to assume that Tan Swie Hian’s art
belongs in the esoteric realm of philosophy and spirituality, understood
by only a privileged few. In fact, the down-to-earth artist lives a simple
and disciplined life revolving around creating art, writing and meditation,
and is a keen and compassionate observer of life and the people around
him. Occasionally, he takes pleasure in enjoying good food and fine wines
with friends.</p>
<p>Tan loves animals, especially cats, and a Chinese ink on paper scroll
titled “Cat’s Cradle” is testament to this. In 1984, the artist’s daughter
kept a pair of kittens as pets. From observing the kittens’ lively movements
when they were playing or fighting, Tan executed the painting as a study
of the rhythm of moving lines. The painting, with seven pairs of cats in
various poses of action, is so vividly captured that it even incurred the
jealousy of another pet cat of his daughter’s – she kept glaring and mewing
at the painting!</p>

</p>
<p>On 26 December 2004, in a cataclysmic event that would be remembered in
years to come, an earthquake in Indonesia triggered a tsunami in the Indian
Ocean that struck 14 countries, claiming the lives of more than 230,000
people.[^11] In memory of the lives lost to this tragedy, Tan created the
sculpture, “The Straw Dog”.</p>
<p>The concept for the sculpture came from a quote by Lao Tze (also Lao Tzu
or Laozi, the Chinese philosopher) in the classic <em>Tao Te Ching</em> (道德经)
which says that “Heaven and Earth are merciless, treating all beings as
straw dogs.” (“天地不 仁，以万物为刍狗。”). In ancient China, the straw dog was a sculpted
object offered in worship, to be discarded after sacrificial rites were
offered. As no visual reference of the actual object exists, Tan created
the sculpture from his imagination. The austere looking bronze sculpture
is a grim reminder of the vulnerability and fragility of life.</p>

</p>
<p>Tan held his first ever solo art exhibition in 1973 when “Paintings of
Infused Contemplation” opened at the since demolished red-brick National
Library building on Stamford Road. Almost 43 years later, in November 2016,
the artist returns to the National Library with “Anatomy of a Free Mind”
– the first ever exhibition to showcase his private notebooks and illustrious
body of works created during that long absence. The National Library is
honoured to partner Tan Swie Hian in charting and presenting his fascinating
creative journeys over the past four decades.</p>
<p>Over the years, Tan has generously donated more than 6,600 items from
his personal collection to the National Library, including artworks and
artefacts as well as manuscripts, notebooks and monographs. These are displayed
at the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library at the National Library Building.
His most recent donation includes the collection of notebooks displayed
in the exhibition.</p>
