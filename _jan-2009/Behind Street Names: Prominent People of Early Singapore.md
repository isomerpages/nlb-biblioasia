####  In colonial Singapore, streets were commonly named after prominent people, usually as a mark of appreciation for their contributions or services rendered to the community, society or state. The Koh Seow Chuan Collection is a valuable resource for historical and social research on Singapore.

What’s in a name? In the case of a street, it helps to identify the location of a place. It would be very difficult to find your way around if streets have no names. However, there is more to street names than just helping you to find your orientation and bearings.

Have you ever wondered why a street was given a particular name? Based on the Koh Seow Chuan Collection of legal documents and maps, we bring you nine streets of Singapore that connect us to the past. Much of Singapore’s early modern history is hidden behind street names we see everyday.

In early Singapore, the Municipal Councillors or Commisioners were in charge of naming the streets. Streets were commonly named after prominent people, usually as a mark of appreciation for their contributions or services rendered to the community, society or state. Thus, behind the street names there are stories about the people they were named after, their lives and achievements, and the part they played in making Singapore what it is today.
