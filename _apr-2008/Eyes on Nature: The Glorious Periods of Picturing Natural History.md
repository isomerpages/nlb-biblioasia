#### The mere mention of the Malay Archipelago conjures up images of amazing rare things and nature’s paradise. During the 17th century, the term “natural history illustration” came into use as artists created images of plants and animals for documentation and study. Early Europeans who had studied the flora and fauna of the region include Stamford Raffles, William Farquhar, William Marsden and Alfred Russel Wallace.

To the early naturalist, the mere mention of Malay Archipelago conjures up images of amazing rare things and nature’s paradise. Interest in natural history in this region corresponded with the energetic intellectual climate in early modern Europe. During the 17th century, the term *natural history illustration* came into use as artists created
images of plants and animals for documentation and study. Many European ships set sail for journeys of discovery
during that period. The travelling naturalists responded to the flora and fauna and to the landscapes, in which they worked.

Rendering the nature’s elegance and beauty has a long history. Dating as early as 30,000 years ago, the oldest "scientific” records can be seen from the French caves.
Pictures of ancient Egyptians sacrifice and Leonardo da Vinci’s sketches of human bodies are notable forms of early scientific drawing. There are also vivid descriptions of
exotic flowers in the South East Asia including the Rafflesia arnoldi, the world’s largest flower and the Orchideous plant,
discovered by Sir Stamford Raffles.

#### **Painting on Cave Walls**

Primitive men are credited with painting on cave walls at Lascaux in France, long before civilisation. Animal figures such as the horses, bison, rhinoceroses, lions, buffalo
and mammoth have been seen. These amazingly accurate drawings seem to indicate that the observers had studied the subject intensely and reproduced the images from memory in dimly lit caves. The meaning and purpose of cave paintings are complicated and varied. Some images record mythological stories, sorcery, fertility and rituals, while others depict hunting scenes. It was believed that drawing a particular animal would invoke the species to propagate and the ritual act of painting or touching these depictions would release
sacred energy or power. Visual aids such as arrows have also been seen next to some drawings and could have been used to train
the young cave dwellers.

Animals played a big part in the lives of the early cultures. They are among the first drawings that human depicted. Various art forms have shown animals in their symbolising power and influences. There are certain degrees of similarity among these animal portrayals. Most animals are shown in broadside view to provide the most information. Birds, quadrupeds and fishes show their most salient characteristics from the side whereas insects and arthropods reveal most of theirs when seen from above.

#### **Tomb Murals and Greek Pottery**

The ancient Egyptians
(5000–300 BC) lived
on high ground along
the banks of the Nile
River and were cattle-
raisers or farmers.
Drawings on buildings,
sculptures, papyri, coffins
and burial tombs
revealed the rich tapestry
of Egyptians’ relationship
with nature
and their beliefs, such
as "life after death”.
One famous depiction
showing a person’s
judgment of the afterlife
is the *Weighing of the Heart*, where the jackal-headed god *Anubis* is weighing
the heart of a priestess. The scale illustrates one example of "ancient technology”.

Ancient Greek (1500–31 BC) was particularly famous
for their vases, sculptures and architecture. Early portrayal
of "scientific apparatus” of the era has shown transport,
hunting tools and techniques of weaving cloths. This period
also marked the beginning of humans and monumental
stone sculptures. Human statutes are heroically proportioned
due to Greek humanistic belief in the nobility of
man. By the time Alexander the Great died at 323 BC, the
Greek sculptors had mastered carving marbles and were
technically perfect. They
sculpted heroic human
figures that still remain
popular today.

#### **Chinese Animal Motif and the Mughal Painting**

Chinese arts are greatly
influenced by nature.
Painting of birds, flowers,
and landscapes
from the countryside
were popular. The earliest
images of animals
are produced during the
Shang Dynasty (1523–1028 BC). Animal
motifs such as cicada,
owl, bear, rabbit, deer, even tapir and Indian rhinoceros are carved in jade or cast
in bronze. Two and more animals are often combined in
a single artwork, representing the "metamorphosis of one
animal into another”. Animals are not the subjects of interest
as living creatures but are for aesthetic and decorative
purposes. The Chinese also like to depict animals with symbolic
meaning. For example, fantasy animals such as dragon
and phoenix with flames (symbolising power) streaming
from their bodies and cranes and zodiac animals (symbolising
long life).

Graphic art started after paper was invented in AD 105.
Although no painting on paper survived from the early Han
period (206 BC–220 AD), stylised animal pictures preserved
on damask and other textiles are found. Chinese ceramics
such as those in Tang Dynasty (AD 600–
900) achieved its
finest artistic standard; for example, the standing figures of
spirited horses.

Hunting scenes, common in many prehistoric illustrations
are also found in India. Religious life of the Hindus (namely
Buddhism and Hinduism) greatly influences the Indian arts.
Human figures are glorified and most animal representations
(elephants and cattle are fairly common) are sculpted in
stones.

Realistic and detailed paintings came about from the
16th century. Monarchs at the time, such as Akbar the Great
and his son, Jahangir were very passionate about painting
and the natural world. The Mughal School of painting came
into being. One famous artist, Mansur was known as the
"painter of flora and fauna”. He travelled with the emperor and created famous images of zebra, neelgai (a kind of
deer) and a variety of birds.

#### **Artists as Scientists from Early Modern Europe**

Around 1400, artists in Europe began to produce more
"realistic” or "naturalistic” style of drawing. During this
period, scholars were increasingly interested to study, collect
and classify living things. Many captivating drawings are
produced and used as identification aids, religious symbols
and philosophical ideas or purely for art appreciation. Over
the next two centuries, this new approach to nature came
to be known as "scientific illustration”.

A man of "both worlds”, Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) was an artist, scientist, engineer and inventor. He
would dissect corpses and record everything he found in his
journals. His images of animals, plants and human bodies
are results of careful observation of natural structures,
forms and compositions.

One of the greatest painter-naturalists of her time was
Maria Sibylla Merian (1647–1717). She created beautiful
visual images of flowers and insects and her observations
revolutionised the science of animals and plants. Her works
are rich with tropical flowers and fruit, insects of all kinds,
especially exotic butterflies, moths and caterpillars.

Another well-known water-colourist, naturalist and
adventurer whose name is synonymous with bird and nature
lover and environmentalist was John James Audubon (1785–1851). His passion for birds resulted in a seven-volume
edition of *The Birds of America* describing the anatomy, habits and localities of the birds with 500
hand-coloured lithographs.

For centuries, artists have worked closely
with the "natural scientists”. Andreas Vesalius
(1514–1564) worked with artist, Jan van
Calcar in the seven-volume, revolutionary
human anatomy textbook, *De humani corporis
fabrica*. Woodcut designer, Hans Weiditz and
botanist, Otto Brunfels (1488–1534) produced
stunning plant studies in *Herbarium vivae
eicone*s. A team of craftsmen and Leonhard
Fuchs (1501–1566) who was a physician and
botanist, created the early printed herbals, *De
historia stipium*.

Voyages and journeys of exploration
became common in early modern Europe.
These ships travelled around the world in
search of scientific discovery. Skilled artists
usually went along and produced amazingly
illustrated botanical and natural history books.
English painter, Augustus Earle (1793–1838)
embarked with Charles Darwin (1809–1882)
in one of the world most famous expedition,
HMS Beagle. Darwin had no artistic flair and
depended on Earle to illustrate the materials
that he collected both at sea and ashore.
