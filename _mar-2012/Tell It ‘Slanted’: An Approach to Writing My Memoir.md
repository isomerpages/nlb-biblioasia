title: "Tell It ‘Slanted’: An Approach to Writing My Memoir"
permalink: /vol-7/issue-4/mar-2012/slanted-writing-memoir/
description: In my view, one cannot write a good memoir without reading other
  people’s memoirs and learning from them. Though I am aware of what Gore Vidal
  said about the difference between an autobiography and a memoir, I am going to
  assume in this essay that they are the same; i.e. a person writes about his
  personal life and at the same time involves himself as a witness to public
  events he/she is influenced by or had influence over. The significance of
  reading what others have written, then, is to see if I can do it differently.
  The question is, “How differently?”
