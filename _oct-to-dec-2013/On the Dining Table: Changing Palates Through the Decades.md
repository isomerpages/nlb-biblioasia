When I was growing up, my grandfather’s elderly cousin would visit us during important festive occasions. The womenfolk in the family would gather to make steamed rice dumplings or 桃粿 (*tao guo*, literally peach dumplings) to use as prayer offerings. I still remember the booming voice of my grandfather’s cousin as her large palms deftly shaped the pink-hued rice dumplings, pressing them into a wooden mould. Nowadays, no one seems to have the time to gather around the kitchen and cook while chatting in the Teochew dialect. These days, my uncles simply buy the *tao guo*; it just tastes different and part of the fun is gone.[^1] 

During the annual Dragon Boat festival, my grandmother would spend days painstakingly preparing the ingredients required for making the pyramid-shaped rice dumplings called 肉粽 (rou zong). It was a tedious process making them: cooking red beans and grinding them into a paste; boiling dried chestnuts and removing the skins; chopping and stirfrying dried prawns, dried mushrooms and fatty pork with coriander powder and other spices; washing bamboo leaves, strings and glutinous rice; and cleaning caul fat membrane and stuffing it with a generous dollop of the red bean paste. The ingredients were then assembled and neatly wrapped in bamboo leaves before being steamed to perfection in bamboo baskets. Nowadays, many families prefer to purchase ready-made dumplings from shops.




#### **My Grandparents'  Generation: 1930s–1950s**
My maternal grandmother arrived in Singapore from Guandong province in China during the late 1930s. As a young bride, she lived with her husband and mother-in-law who were farmers. Life settled into a routine of waking up before dawn to feed the pigs and chickens,tending to the vegetable plots, and cooking three meals a day. My great grandmother would harvest the vegetables and sell them at a nearby makeshift market.
