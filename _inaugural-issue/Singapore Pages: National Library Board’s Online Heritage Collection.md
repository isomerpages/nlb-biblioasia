#### Singapore Pages, the gateway to online and print resources on Singapore, was launched on 31 October 2003.

#### **Background**
When NLB planned to showcase its heritage collection online in 2003, they thought of an appropriate name to give to the portal - a name that would instantly invite people to thumb through Singapore’s history and culture. A myriad of interesting names were thrown up, but one stuck as it was at once a simple yet consummate description of how the Singapore experience gets documented - through our pages. Singapore Pages, NLB’s gateway to online and print resources on Singapore was thus born and officially launched on 31 October 2003.

#### **Prelude to Singapore Pages**
Among the treasures at the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library are our rare books and manuscripts. The need to preserve these older and valuable items for future generations meant that they have to be kept under restricted access. At the same time, there are other older and valuable collections on Singapore that reside in overseas institutions. By virtue of distance and restricted access policy, these collections are out of reach for most Singaporeans. One such collection resides at the world-renowned British Library - the Oriental & India Office Collection. From this collection, of most significance to Singapore are the early printed books and periodicals from Malaysia and Singapore that include works from mission presses, lithographed works from early Muslim presses, Peranakan books in Malay, and a wide range of government and official records.

To bridge the gap between these rare gems and their potential users, NLB started an initiative to identify and digitise them, a task that would take the Library through several phases. The initial phase involved a collaboration with the British Library that led to a trial digitisation of 38 of their rare items. From the NLB’s heritage collection residing at the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library, another 38 rare items were identified and digitised. Needing a platform to showcase these 76 items, NLB created* Singapore Pages*. Thus began NLB’s journey to bring to Singaporeans and to the world written words and images that tell the Singapore story.

#### **Highlights of Singapore Pages**
**Digitised Collection and The Singapore Story**

Arising from NLB’s digitisation of the rare imprints, more than 13,000 digital images documenting Singapore’s history and culture are now available in *Singapore Pages’ Digitised Collection*. These include early Singapore imprints and primary sources such as government records and manuscripts that are commonly referred to by researchers. They have significantly augmented the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library’s Singapore and Southeast Asian Collections, for many a story can be told when the age-old printed books are supplemented by the new-age online materials. Whether they tell of the challenges and triumphs that shaped the remarkable lives of our forefathers or of the milestones that punctuated Singapore’s growing up years, these stories are weaved from the lines of the printed as well as the online pages. *Singapore Pages* have captured and displayed these stories under its researched articles section called *The Singapore Story.*

*The Singapore Story* is an attempt at sifting out interesting details about Singapore’s history from the digitised pages. Our Singapore and Southeast Asian librarians then reenact the past by combining these details and other nuggets that they have unearthed from the Singapore and Southeast Asian Collections. Applying the adage, “a picture is worth a thousand words”, The Singapore Story write-ups are peppered with images taken from the digitised pages.
