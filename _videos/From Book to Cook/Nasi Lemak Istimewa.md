#### **Episode summary** ####
In this episode, we make an unusual version of nasi lemak using a recipe from 1953. The recipe comes from book by Siti Radhiah, an early female Malay cookbook author. Is it really *nasi lemak* if it doesn’t use pandan? Join librarian and food researcher Toffa Abdul Wahed as we find out!

#### **Recipes**
These recipes were originally published in Jawi in *Memilih Selera* (Choosing Tastes; 1953), and Toffa has translated them into English.
