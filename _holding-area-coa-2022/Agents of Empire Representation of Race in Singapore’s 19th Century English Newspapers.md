#### **Introduction**

Singapore’s first newspaper, the  <i> Singapore Chronicle </i> , was published a mere five years after Stamford Raffles stepped ashore in 1819.[^1] Soon, the printed word took such a hold of the public mind that busy merchants in Commercial Square (now Raffles Place) were spending a half hour daily discussing the news, including commodity prices and the arrival and departure of cargo-laden ships.[^2]

A plethora of newspapers were launched during the 19th century, though most sank rather quickly. Some, like the <i>Singapore Free Press</i>, survived well into the 20th century, while the <i>Straits Times</i> is in circulation to this day. Virtually all newspapers then perpetuated ideas of race, civilisation, progress and development that subordinated the native and immigrant populations to white colonisers. This essay will show how they did so, by drawing examples from local English-language newspapers across a quarter of a century – from 1875, when Singapore was still a young Crown Colony following its administrative reconstitution into the Straits Settlements, to
the close of the century. The newspapers propped up the imperial edifice,
alongside weapons, books, art and other modes of knowledge production
that have been so extensively studied by scholars of postcolonialism.


#### **The Sociopolitical Context – Global and Local**
By the mid-19th century, the tentacles of British imperialism had reached
into the farthest expanses of Asia and Africa through coercion, deception
and collaboration with local elites. The brutal suppression of the 1857 revolt
in India had been followed by the passing of power into the hands of the
Crown under Queen Victoria. The 258-year-old East India Company was
out, and the Age of Empire officially dawned. This puzzled the British. How
could an island of 17 million establish sovereignty over territories thousands
of miles away and many times greater in size and population? The English
historian John Robert Seeley captured this sense of disbelief, writing in 1883:
“We seem, as it were, to have conquered and peopled half the world in a fit
of absence of mind.”[^3]
There was no dearth of (pseudo) scientific theories to explain the
impossible. Most of these coalesced under social Darwinism. Seizing upon
Darwin’s 1838 theory of biological evolution, academics like Herbert Spencer
quickly concocted its social counterpart, i.e., survival among individuals
competing for limited resources. And given that Europeans in general and
the English in particular were winning the competition, the academics
concluded that the European civilisation was the apex of human evolution,
with others – Hindu, Islamic, Chinese, African, Malay – competing for a
distant second place.[^4]

Singapore had its fair share of colonial administrators who subscribed
to these ideas. Raffles himself, until so recently considered a progressive
administrator, believed in a metaphorical racial ladder, the highest rungs of
which were occupied by Europeans, followed by those natives who adopted
Western modes of behaviour, lifestyle and clothing.[^5]

Four decades after leaving Singapore, its second Resident, the inveterate
traveller and writer John Crawfurd, observed:

     In understanding, in judgment, in taste, in invention, in reach

     of imagination, in enterprise, in perseverance, and in the

     moral sense, the European, placed under equally favourable

     conditions, is greatly superior to the Asiatic.[^6]
Sir Frederick Weld, Governor of the Straits Settlements (1880–87),
echoed similar sentiments: “I think that capacity for governing is a
characteristic of our race, and it is wonderful to see in a country like the
Straits.”[^7] The Chinese, in Weld’s estimation, depended on the British to look
after them much as “a groom looks after a horse”, and the Malays were in
awe of British probity even in the face of the most alluring 
temptations.[^8]

In the second half of the 19th century, both the opening of the Suez
Canal and the long-distance steamship’s increasing dominance of the ocean
enabled “scientific” theories concocted in London to quickly make their way
to the empire’s outposts, while observations made in far-flung places like
Malaya travelled swiftly to the metropole. This created a circle of knowledge
that endlessly reproduced the same ideas, tropes and stereotypes until they
took on the veneer of truth.

One of the more obvious ways in which newspapers perpetuated
racial hierarchies was by giving voice to new-fangled theories and books.
In December 1853, for example, the <i>Singapore Free Press and Mercantile
Advertiser</i> published a report on a phrenology lecture given by a Mr Sargent
to a “numerous audience”; decades later, the <i>Mid-Day Herald</i> excitedly
announced the arrival of Mrs Josepha North, a sculptor turned renowned
phrenologist, on the island’s shores.[^9] Phrenology, a now discredited science, claimed a relationship between various races’ skull shapes and intelligence,
and the race it deemed the most intelligent was obvious.

Occasionally, the  <i> Free Press </i>  printed chapters from new books in
serialised form. One chapter titled “The Chinese Towkay” from a book
called  <i> People in a Native State </i> , published on 2 December 1893, is illustrative:

     Many Towkays I know are perfectly at home with a knife and

     fork, indeed some of them give capital dinners. As they have

     educated themselves so far towards civilized society, it is to be

     hoped that they will continue to progress and thereby in time

     cultivate a correct palate for champagne and other wines, so

     that “Comet” and other wonderful but undrinkable beverages

     may no longer adorn (?) their hospitable tables.[^10]

But the newspapers’ role extended beyond mere conduits of information;
they must be situated within a suitable theoretical framework.

#### **Why Newspapers? “Knowing” the Native and “Creating” the Self**
In the late 19th century, the national newspaper, along with the telegraph,
was critical to empire and empire-building (and eventually, to those who
opposed empire). Various British governments sought to control information
flow, shape the interpretation of events and form “symbiotic” relationships
with newswires like Reuters for their own political ends.[^11]

Papers in imperial outposts like the Straits Settlements with their
insignificant English-reading population could not bring down governments
in Britain, but they could certainly have an impact on local policy and affect
public estimation of colonial officials on the island. By controlling the flow
of information and deciding what to publish and omit, newspapers and their
owners became arbiters of public opinion, the gatekeepers who decided what
would be discussed in Commercial Square that afternoon or at the Padang
that evening. Far from being ephemera, then, newspapers were of a piece
with other modes of knowledge production on which the colonial project
was predicated.

Reporting on daily humdrum events and highlighting the minutiae of
19th-century Singapore’s daily life allowed newspapers and their subscribers
to “know” the native Other (“native” is used here to denote all non-
European races in Singapore) as much as the more commonly analysed
forms of media, including but not limited to books, travelogues, pamphlets,
art, official censuses and catalogues. While these media offered a more
big-picture view of native lives and were usually produced for consumption
in imperial metropoles, newspapers were printed locally and carried mostly
local news for the benefit of the local ruling race, or as was the case with
one newspaper that will be analysed later, for the benefit of a race aspiring to
join the rulers on their pedestal.

In critiquing colonial knowledge structures, Edward Said defined
Orientalism as “a library or archive of information commonly and, in some
of its aspects, unanimously held. What bound the archive together was a
family of ideas and a unifying set of values proven in various ways to be
effective”.[^12] English newspapers in 19th-century Singapore belonged to
this archive.

An important element in this family of ideas was the colonial power’s
imagination of itself. The British saw themselves as superior not just
economically and militarily but also politically and ethically – a unique
people destined to bring progress to the non-white world.[^13] Superiority was
possible only by being separate, by creating an identity distinct from that of
the natives. When the British first landed on Indian shores as mere traders,
for example, they carved out residential enclaves away from the natives.[^14]
At home, in offices or out hunting in the field, they maintained a studied
aloofness from local customs, traditions and populations. This tendency
intensified when they became the dominant political and military force
in South and Southeast Asia. By 1867, expression of this separateness had
become the norm.

“Don’t admit that you’re living in an Oriental country, live nearly as
possible as you would in Europe,” was Roland Braddell’s advice to his countrymen in Singapore.[^15] Broadsheets helped in this endeavour by
carrying in-depth reports on quintessentially English sports like cricket
and drag hunting and by publishing wistful memories of Christmas “back
home”, among other things.[^16] In fact, in elucidating its aims and objectives,
the first-ever issue of the Straits Times indicated a desire to engender British
nationalism among the Straits Englishmen who found themselves so far
away from home.[^17]

Such reporting created a variation of Benedict Anderson’s concept of the
nation as an “imagined community” – an imagined <i>imperial</i> community
that connected one Englishman to another, separate from the traditions
of the place that they physically inhabited and superior to the races of
the region.[^18]  News from London, commodity prices, ship arrivals and
departures, colonial appointments, births and deaths all connected the
empire’s frontiers to its hub. The English were <i>in</i> Singapore, but often
not <i>of</i>  it.

English newspapers in the 19th century can thus be analysed under
the rich theoretical tradition of postcolonial studies. It is to three such
newspapers that were published in Singapore that we turn next. The
sections below will examine how the <i>Straits Times</i> (ST) depicted native
populations in the sports arena from 1875 to 1899, how the <i>Straits Eurasian
Advocate</i> (SEA) emphasised Eurasian identity and represented Indian and
Chinese immigrants in 1888, and how the <i>Straits Observer</i> (SO) depicted the
Malays during a short-lived but acute crisis in Perak in 1876. These papers
were accessed via NewspaperSG, the newspaper archive of Singapore’s
National Library.[^19]

#### **How They Make Us Laugh**

     In the boxing match, a Chinaman while in the pursuit of

     defending himself from his antagonist, dropped his nether

     garment; his hands being bound with his gloves, was at a loss

     to brush himself up, which caused not a little laughter and

     merriment.[^20]

The festive season in Singapore – a fortnight that included Christmas
and the New Year – usually ended with a full day of sporting activities at
the Padang on the first or second day of the year. By all accounts it was a
joyous, raucous occasion with thousands lining the carriage track around
the ground; men, women and children of all races dressed in their finery to
witness the sporting prowess of the best that the island had to offer. It was
the one day when the ruling and the ruled occupied the same public space,
and enjoyed the same entertainment, albeit with the natives segregated from
the Europeans. In a rare instance when the two were forced to mingle, the
ST was quick to point out that “it would be better if on a future occasion
the arrangements for the comfort of Europeans were amplified. There were
many Europeans who were standing all afternoon among the natives, and
that is not altogether pleasant”.[^21]

Since the English could not afford to be seen being beaten by the locals,
the competition was segregated too. What was more, the sports themselves differed. Europeans participated in “foot races and athletic exercises; and in
the sack race, three legged race, boxing match, and race with water buckets
poised on the head”.[^22] The natives walked a greasy tongkang boom to pluck
a twig or a flag from the end, vied to eat the most number of hard biscuits
and dunked their heads into buckets of treacle in search of a half-dollar
coin.[^23] By the close of the century, “rikisha pulling” – in which Chinese and
Indians raced rickshaws carrying a European passenger over a distance of
220 yards – had been introduced to the programme.

Of the biscuit-eating, the ST intoned thus:

     Most of the eaters evidently entered for the sake of the feed,

     as their leisurely mastication did not suggest that they were in

     for a prize. Two or three, however, made <i>little beasts</i> [emphasis

     added] of themselves and were accordingly awarded $2.25

     between them.[^24]

Treacle-dipping did not escape the paper’s lampooning either:

     Imagine, good folks at home, enthusiasts for the small sum

     of fifty cents plunging their heads into a tub of golden syrup

     – or its prototype – and groping about for the melancholy

     coin…  <i> they ran amok </i> , afterwards, all dripping and half

     blind with treacle, and the  <i> wild stampede of the Asiatics </i>  in

     their Sunday clothes, as each competitor made a beeline for

     the sea, was probably  <i> the most comical part of the business </i> 

     [emphases added].[^25]
	
Such reportage reduced the natives to caricature, clowns in a
circus conducted by English ringmasters. In Singapore, as elsewhere,
infantilisation of the colonised populations was key to perpetuating the
notion of English superiority.[^26] One newspaper gleefully narrated events from Bangalore, India, where “rather a novel mode of amusement has been
introduced by the officers of the 21st Hussars”.27 The soldiers pitted their
Indian servants – syces (horse carers) against cooks – in a cricket match.
Not being familiar with the sport, the servants’ clumsy attempts at playing
it caused much merriment among their masters, “more especially at the
fielding in which not a few in their eagerness to join in a leather hunt often
came into collision and cannoned against each other rather roughly”.28
	
Overlordship could be justified if one bought into the idea that the
wild Asiatic races – uncultured children masquerading as adults – needed a
guiding hand, a paterfamilias, to look after their well-being. Depictions of
natives as clumsy cartoon figures helped build that image.

Often, what was left out was almost as significant as what was reported.
For instance, papers usually listed all the winners of European sports while
making no mention whatsoever of those from local sports. The natives were
just that – “the natives” – an entertaining agglomeration, the individual
members of which did not matter.29

There is remarkable uniformity in how the New Year sports activities
were described over the years. In 1875, the ST reported that  <i> “among the
most amusing of the races </i>  was one of a hundred yards with tubs of treacle,
which placed on their heads, so besmeared the contestants with the sweet
liquid that they were glad to rid themselves by a plunge off the Government
pier”.30 A quarter-century later, in 1899, the paper was similarly tickled:
“possibly, however, the  <i> funniest thing of all </i>  [emphasis added] was the treacle
dipping competition. The spectacle presented by a number of natives
endeavouring to pick up half dollars with their teeth out of tub of treacle is
better imagined than described.”31

The images of the natives were relentlessly recycled over the years: little 
Malay ruffians always got themselves a good meal out of the biscuit-eating competition, clueless Chinamen always struggled with the science of
boxing, and the Klings were always prone to taking things easy, even
in competition.

In sharp contrast to this, European sports were accorded the respect
and gravitas in keeping with the colonial power’s opinion of itself. Once
the native games were out of the way in the morning, the Europeans took
over with fare that was generally “more attractive” than what had preceded
it. Distances jumped, heights leaped and race times were reported in
admiring terms, closely fought contests were “capital” and participants
invariably acquitted themselves creditably. In this way, the newspaper served
to degrade the native and enhance the European, further entrenching
racial differences.

#### **Native? Who, Me?**

     [P]ure natives are as distinct from Eurasians as chalk and

     cheese, and it is well that this should be known; for owing to

     this very common mistake, the Eurasian body has suffered

     considerably.32

In the late 19th century, the Padang was a curious site: a quasi-democratic
venue to which all races descended for New Year festivities, and also a place
where racial and class differences were starkly visible thanks to segregated
seating areas and competitions. By 1885, these differences had become
starker with the erection of the Singapore Recreation Club’s (SRC) pavilion
at the other end of the ground from the Singapore Cricket Club (SCC).
Founded by a group of miffed Eurasians when they were denied entry to the
“pure-white” SCC, the pavilion was a weighty reminder of the extant racial
differences.33 In 1887, a peeved reader wrote in to the ST complaining of the
treatment meted out to SRC members at an SCC event:

     Some such courtesy might have been shown to the <i> Committee</i> 

     [emphasis in original] of the S.R.C. if not to all the

     members, and as respectable as any of the S.C.C. members,

     although not born in Europe. But the usual class distinction

     prevailed… – a distinction which is as unworthy of those

     who are responsible for making it, as it is humiliating to those

     against whom the line is drawn.34

The Eurasians were a deeply insecure community at the time. Ease
of transportation had brought not just ideas, but also more and more
pure-blooded European men and women to Singapore’s shores. Whatever
porosity had existed – it was not uncommon for European men to take
up with local women across Malaya, for instance – disappeared; ideas of
racial purity became more stringent, and social contact with the locals was
increasingly frowned upon.35

The Eurasians found themselves far removed from the upper echelons
of European society, lumped with the natives. This insecurity, and its
attendant anger, played itself out in various newspapers that emerged to
support the Eurasian cause in Singapore. They did so by heaping contempt
on the Chinese, Malays and Indians – inflicting on them the same
humiliation that they accused the Europeans of perpetrating. The SEA was
one such paper.

Started in 1887 as a Saturday weekly by a Eurasian named John
Nicholson, the SEA was the community’s second attempt at a propaganda
organ when it saw itself “being gradually isolated” from the mainstream
life on the island.36 The SEA lasted three years, of which only four months’
issues survive (March–June 1888).

The paper’s fundamental objective was to impress upon its readers that
Eurasians were distinct from, and superior to, the native population and
as intelligent, meritorious and eminent as their European brethren.37 One
of the ways in which it did so was by recasting Eurasians’ native halves as “Aryan”. While the Chinese were Chinese, and the Klings, Klings, the
Eurasians were half-European,  half-<i>Aryan</i>.


     Do not disparage yourselves because of your Aryan half.

     Through this half you inherit the intelligence, brain power and

     chivalry of an ancient civilization, a civilization from which

     Europe has borrowed its learning, and the best part of its

     laws and literature and much of its arts and sciences. It is the

     infusion of Aryan blood that has made the British what it is.38

This semantic sleight of hand helped insecure Eurasians view themselves
as part of the ruling race, while allowing wriggle room to shower contempt
on those outside it. The Chinese, who by now were immigrating to
Singapore in large numbers and whose ways of life were increasingly
becoming more Western, found themselves in the crosshairs more often
than not.39

Articulating immigration concerns that would continue to echo in
Singapore more than a century later, the SEA screeched that “Singapore
is being flooded with all sorts of villains from China, and owing to these
importations Crime is becoming more and more frequent by the day”, so
much so that “nothing short of flogging would make night-disturbers take
the right path”.40

Jail was pointless, because according to the SEA, it did not serve as
a strong-enough deterrent. “They are much too pampered and well-fed”
there, with the cost of keeping them in far more than the income they
could generate by pursuing various vocations during incarceration.41 Could
not, one SEA reporter wondered, “something more be squeezed [out of the
inmates] so as to not allow them to eat the bread of idleness so cheaply?”42

It escaped the SEA that the manpower needed to lug cargo, construct
new roads and bridges, look after plantations and ferry Europeans (and
undoubtedly some Eurasians) around a rapidly expanding town was drawn from the same pool as the “villains” and “blackguards” causing it so much
consternation. Most importantly, this pool contributed to the opium tax
that formed the bulk of the colonial government’s revenue. But once again
foreshadowing modern-day discussions on the desire for foreign labour to
do essential but unsavoury work and yet be invisible, the SEA expressed its
distaste at being “jostled by a half-nude Chinaman” pulling a rickshaw or at
the sight of Chinese coolies bathing at public wells.43
Any kind of agency by these other races was frowned upon. When the
Domestic Servants Registration Ordinance encouraging employers to hire
only registered individuals as servants came into force on 1 January 1888, the
SEA was vexed:

     The lower classes of Chinese from which we procure our

     servants would sooner follow the bent of their inclinations and

     turn rogues and thieves than<i> take service except on their own terms</i> 

     [emphasis added].44

The recommended antidote to this intransigence was to dump them
forcefully into “gharries” and drive them to the relevant office to be
registered, which the Chinese refused to do “for want of a good kicking”.45

Another suggestion was to import servants from India – Calcutta or
Madras – who were cheaper, more efficient and more pliable. This was fine
as long as the Indians stuck to servitude and did not stuff themselves into
trousers and coats, so as to deceive outsiders into thinking that “every black
man with a coat is a Eurasian”.46

Any non-European who wielded even a modicum of power was to be
viewed suspiciously. The Tamil Chettiars, most of whom came to Singapore
as money lenders, were to be avoided because their usury practices often
trapped unsuspecting Eurasians into a vicious cycle of poverty and debt.
The Indian money lender, warned the SEA, was not “behind in his virtues
to ‘Shylock’”.47 The native constable was nothing but a dummy on the street who needed constant monitoring by his European peers – surprise visits to
the area of his beat were highly recommended.48

Relative to the Chinese and the Indians, the Malays were far removed
from the colonial enterprise and thus from Singapore’s public life. This was
reflected in their absence from the SEA’s pages. The few times they did
appear, it was as part of gangs that indulged in brutish violence against the
Indians and the Chinese and as singers of obscene songs that disturbed
the public peace at night.49 Occasionally, calls were made to replace
“outlandish” native road names with “decent ones”.50

the public peace at night.49 Occasionally, calls were made to replace

The paper tried to acquire this currency for its audience not just by
highlighting their achievements but by using language that debased
the native populace’s habits, culture and tradition. It inflicted linguistic
violence (half-naked Chinaman; demoniac Malay; Shylock-like Chetty) and
advocated physical violence (flogging, harsher conditions in jails) – both of
which served to further reify racialised hierarchies in Singapore.

#### **Barbarians, the Lot of Them**

     
It is absurd that such a wealthy country should be left in the

     hands of blood-thirsty treacherous savages.52

Times of crisis serve as an interesting counterpoint to the breezy news
coverage of the New Year’s Day sports. While the latter painted a picture of
child-like native behaviour, the former instigated reportage that represented
them in almost bestial terms.

Part of this was down to fear. Singapore’s European population, rapidly
though it had grown in the latter half of the 19th century, was small compared to the rest; it rippled with fear at any hint of disquiet among
the locals.53

The November 1875 murder of the Perak Resident James Birch was
one such crisis that reverberated up and down Malaya. Birch, a long-term
colonial officer, was the Straits Settlements’ Colonial Secretary before being
transferred to the native state of Perak as its first Resident. The position was
in theory an advisory one, but this was, in the words of Frederick Weld,
“one of those fictions in which we seem to delight, as not a penny of money
can be spent out of the State revenues without the assent of the Governor,
and, under him, the military or police force is entirely in the hands of
the Resident”.54
Birch, invested thus with immense power, was not well liked by the
ruling chiefs, who thought him unduly meddlesome. They approached the
Straits Settlements’ Governor Andrew Clarke with a petition to prevent
Birch from interfering in local customs, including the right to levy taxes
on their people and maintain slaves. After receiving a tepid response, a few
chiefs conspired to murder the Resident in cold blood. It is beyond the
scope of this paper to analyse this incident.55 It shall instead focus on local
developments in the immediate aftermath of the murder and the reaction
the murder elicited in Singapore’s English-language media.

Within days, the Straits Settlements’ Legislative Council, now headed by
Governor Sir William Jervois (1875–77), passed a slew of ordinances to curb
the chances of any violent outbreak on the island. Sale or purchase of arms,
including bayonets, swords, daggers, krisses, spears and all other “weapons
of offence”, was immediately banned; they could be procured only when a
licence was issued by an officer appointed with the Governor’s sanction.56
In discussions over how the crisis should be handled, one member of the
Legislative Council invoked his long experience of having dealt with the Malays to suggest that the best way to teach them a lesson would be by
hanging them.57

As British troops from Singapore, Melaka and Penang left for Perak,
a tremor of fear went through the defenceless settlements. The SO called
upon the Volunteer Defence Force to band together as one in front of the
native public, in case the latter was harbouring any treacherous ideas, and
published numerous letters from members of the public who were baffled at
the force’s inaction after the troops’ departure.58

Meanwhile, the newspaper continued to publish regular, detailed reports
of the action unfolding in Perak and surrounding areas. Speaking about
one recalcitrant chief’s desire to surrender in the face of the relentless British
assault, a correspondent wrote in with a comment that revealed colonial
beliefs and desires:

     With the <i>true instinct of the ignoble savage</i>, he wishes to sneak

     out of the consequences of his treachery as soon as he finds

     out we are in earnest… There is no equal stretch of land under

     the tropics so rich in minerals. <i>These the Malays do not work</i>

     [emphases added] and the Chinaman will sink no money in

     unless the British occupy it.59

The mercantile class in Singapore, Penang and Melaka had been eyeing
the fecund Perak land at least since the Straits Settlements became a Crown
Colony, run directly from London instead of India. To this end, they had
pressured every governor since Harry Ord to entrench British commercial
interests in the region, ramping up the pressure after the 1874 Treaty of
Pangkor recognised British suzerainty on the Malay Peninsula.60 Some had invoked England’s moral duty to civilise the land, others the desire to save
the oppressed peasants from feckless chiefs.

Birch’s brutal murder convinced the authorities that action had to
be taken. The SO egged them on. In response to a letter expressing rare
dissent towards British policy in peninsular Malaya, the paper fumed that
“barbarous horde of savages such as these Malays of Perak have proved
themselves” deserved no mercy and even if the Straits colonists had to
submit to income tax in order to fund the revenge mission, they would do
so. The Straits merchants loathed any public expenditure, so this showed
the strength of feeling that prevailed in this matter. Of course, the prospect
of being able to mine, strip and cultivate Perak was attractive too. Any
tax imposed could be recouped, because not only was the region awash
in minerals, its soil was also hospitable to cash crops like tea, coffee and
tobacco, and its forests rich in timber.61

Months later, when the war was won and the deposed chief’s regalia
put on public display at the Legislative Council, the SO was dismayed at its
impoverished nature – “one small gold kris, two passable sword hilts, and a
large piece of glass enclosed in filagree work” and other things that looked
like they belonged in a pantomime. The paper mourned that if this “be
the most we are to get from Perak, that much vaunted country will not be
worth annexing”.62

However, there was another, more critical reason for invasion that the
paper itself expressed: Britain could not afford to lose face. “British prestige”
was paramount, “whatever may be the cause of a dispute” because it would
affect their standing among the natives through the entire region. Thus,
as the war got bloodier and British losses mounted, venomous frustration
spilled over on the SO’s pages.

     There would be a great deal of moral suasion in placing a

     hobnailed boot on the bare back of a Malay. Another moral

     suasion project is to have some gun practice. How the Malays

     would stare to see an extempore butt, a target in mid stream

     smashed to atoms.63

As the tide began to turn in Britain’s favour, attention switched to what
should be done with Perak. Leaving it to the “Chiefs and Chinamen” to
fight it out was out of the question. One newspaper thought of installing
a “native puppet” whose strings would be in English hands, while the SO
suggested that “as we shall have to govern it in any case, we may as well
govern it openly, without the inconvenient hypocrisy of using a native
speaking-trumpet”.64 As it turned out, one such puppet and trumpet by
the name of Raja Yusof was installed with a new Resident, Hugh Low, in
tow, thus entrenching British dominance in the Malay states for a long time
to come.

#### **Conclusion**

Newspapers were alchemical agents that repackaged “scientific theories” of
racial superiority into nuggets that could be easily internalised. Depending
on the context, representations of local races swung between cartoonish
and exotic, childish and brutish. *Naturally*, the native on the sports field
was a buffoon; *obviously* one did not want to associate with a black man
just because he had shoved himself into coat and trousers; *was there any
doubt* that the mutinous Malay was nothing but a treacherous savage? By
monotonous repetition, newspapers hammered home these ideas until they
became as real as the ink in which they were printed.

The same held true for the British self-image. *Undeniably*, British sports
were more attractive and the competition more palatable; of course the
British mission was to civilise the locals for their own good. As Charles
Hirschman noted, “Racism provided a rationale for the ‘white man’s burden’
of leading, ruling, or conquering peoples at ‘lower evolutionary stages’
throughout the world. This ideology fitted well with the British need to
justify its empire.”65

The empire casts a long shadow, and old stereotypes continue to
infiltrate modern popular culture. A study conducted in 2020 on football
commentary concluded that it “hardens the view of black athletes being their ‘God-given’ physical and athletic attributes”.66 Closer to home, the
“*lepak* Malay guy” is a trope that has endured ever since Malays were
characterised as a lazy, uncivilised race for their refusal to be a part of
colonial capitalism.67 None of this is new, but by making newspapers the
foci of analysis, it becomes apparent that 19th-century newspapers that

26 The Indian historian Manu Pillai makes the same point in the context of how the English treated the subcontinent’s Bacchanalian royalty. “As with stereotypes generally,” he says, “while there was a measure of truth to this talk of excess, its circulation also served more insidious purposes. For the British, it conveniently infantilized Indian rulers and cemented the claim that natives were simply incapable of serious government.” For details, see Manu Pillai, _False Allies: India’s Maharajas in the Age of Ravi Verma_ (New Delhi: Juggernaut, 2021).

36 The first newspaper by the Eurasians was _Straits Intelligence_. It was started by a piano tuner named John Hansen in the early 1870s and sank rather swiftly.

37 An interesting exchange occurred between the SEA and a correspondent who took objection to the paper naming meritorious Eurasians in its pages. The correspondent claimed that some of those named may have wanted to hide the fact that they were Eurasian “for reasons best known to themselves”. It is not difficult to guess what those reasons would have been. The paper’s spirited response was that “we do not hold any very exalted view of the man who is ashamed of his origin”.

53 The 1857 Indian Rebellion, for example, caused the Europeans to become inordinately afraid of the Indians in Singapore, so much so that the Straits Settlements began agitating against Indian convicts being transported to the island. This fear may have worsened relations between the broader European and Indian communities and contributed to lower migration rates of the latter to Singapore in the subsequent decades. For a detailed discussion on this, see Rajesh Rai, “The 1857 Panic and the Fabrication of an Indian ‘Menace’ in Singapore,” _Modern Asian Studies_ 47, no. 2 (2013): 365–405.

60 Sir Harry Ord was Governor from 1867 to 1871, during which time he tried to abide by the policy of non-intervention in native states – a legacy of the 1857 Indian Mutiny. Sir Andrew Clarke’s gradual reversal of this policy culminated in the Pangkor Treaty of 1874; propelled by mercantile fervour and angered by Birch’s assassination, Clarke’s successor Sir William Jervois was even more forceful in his thrust up and into the Peninsula.
