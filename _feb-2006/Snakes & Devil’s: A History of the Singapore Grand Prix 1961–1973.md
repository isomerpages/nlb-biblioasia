#### Before the first-ever night-time Formula 1 Grand Prix held in Singapore, there were the Malaysian Grand Prix (Singapore) from 1961 to 1965 and the Singapore International Grand Prix from 1966 to 1973.

Common myth has it that before the Sepang Formula 1 Grand Prix in Malaysia, there was nothing in Southeast Asia to call a proper race. The roulette player had the Macau casino, Suzie Wong was the girl in the next bar and A-go-go was the rage in music. Southeast Asia offered lovely sunsets, *stengahs* and last vestiges of colonial rule. Behind the corrugated iron though, there existed a whole different world of CastroI R mixed with acetone, color and noise, snakes and devils, and racing.

Motor racing in Singapore took off in a big way with the first Grand Prix in 1961. It was called the Orient Year Grand Prix and was held for the first time on a designated stretch of Upper Thomson Road. In 1962, the race was renamed the Malaysian Grand Prix and the Malaysian race called the Selangor Grand Prix (back when Singapore was part of Malaysia). When Singapore gained independence in 1965, the country ran its own Grand Prix in 1966 while Malaysian held two, one timed around the Singapore Grand Prix in March/April and another in September. They were known as the Malaysian Grand Prix and the Selangor Grand Prix respectively. With the onset of the European winter, and if budget permitted, the racing season in Asia would begin at Macau, move to Australia and New Zealand with the Tasman Series, and return to Southeast Asia with back-to-back Grand Prix races in Singapore, Johore, Selangor and Penang, followed by Japan.

#### **The Malaysian Grand Prix (Singaporel1961 to 1965**
The inaugural Orient Year Grand Prix was held over the weekend of 15–17 September 1961 and an overenthusiastic crowd saw ticket sales halted by the police an hour after the races had begun. The main Grand Prix race of Sports and Racing Cars saw a mixed grid of everything from a Cooper monoposto to a Warrior Bristol (not quite the Cooper Jaguar it was listed as) - the race pitted strengths of a new streamlined Lola Climax with long range tanks; a 1955 Ferrari 500 Mondial Spider (chassis 0528 MD); a Lotus 15 with the ex-Jan Bussell Ferrari Mondial engine shoehorned into it); an Aston Martin DB3S (chassis 106); and a couple of Lotus, a Le Mans works car and a Climax. The race was run over 60 laps and was won by Ian Barnwell in the Aston Martin DB3S (which had also won in Macau in 1958). Saw Kim Thiat (who last raced in the 1953 Johore Grand Prix) had led for most ofthe race in the ex-Peter Heath Lotus 11 Climax 1100 but suffered from overheating problems. Saw however set FTD of 2:47 on lap 14, a lap time that would be bettered each year until it fell below the two-minute mark 10 years later.

The event was renamed the First Malaysian Grand Prix the following April. Motorbikes dominated the Grand Prix with 83 entries. 11 local riders had works rides from Moto Guzi and Ducati in Italy and Yamaha and Tohatsu in Japan. The track had also been widened by a few feet and completely resurfaced with "Barbergreen."

While the organisers may have been looking forward to the event attaining international status, they were equally anxious to avoid commercialising the Grand Prix.

1962 also saw the appearance of the Formula Junior single-seater and the Jaguar E-Type sports car at the races. Chan Lye Choon's Lotus 22 Formula Junior and Bill Wyllie's DKWTojeiro received a lot of attention but it was the Jaguar E-Type that would dominate. Local boy Yong Nam Kee (known affectionately to friends as Fatso Yong) won in an E-Type while Peter Cowling's Cooper Climax single-seater set FTD (Fastest Time of Day).

It was only from 1963 that the Grand Prix in Singapore featured in the World Motor Racing calendar. The motorcycle Grand Prix was run over the same weekend as the cars had star billing due to its international status, and notable names present included John Grace, Chris Conn, Fumio Ito and Soh Guan Bee.

The Jaguar's dominance was being eroded by "Garagistas" and there were 12 Lotus compared to seven E-type Jaguars. While those battles raged all weekend, the Japanese quietly slipped into the country with their "works" entries - 10 600ce Mitsubishi cars for the Saloon and Tourer race.
