#### With great power comes great responsibility. **Jacqueline Lee** and **Chiang Yu Xiang** use their power to give us an overview of the history of comics in Singapore.

Since the first comic book, The Glasgow Looking Glass – which poked fun at the fashion and politics of 19th-century Scottish society – was published in Glasgow in 1825,1 comics have become more and more mainstream and popular. Comics these days are used to educate, entertain, lampoon, satirise and provoke. 

Today, Singapore has a thriving local scene with homegrown comic book artists and writers. Life in the city-state is a fertile backdrop for many budding comic artists. As Sonny Liew, who wrote the award-winning graphic novel The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye (2015), notes: “Artists often write about what they know, so stories set in Singapore or with a local flavour are a natural step.”2

When people talk about local comics today, what come to mind are popular comic series such as Mr Kiasu and Liew’s The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye. However, there are other works by Singaporean comic book artists that are equally well received and have won awards as well.

#### **Award-winning Comics**

The Eisner Awards are sometimes referred to as the comics industry’s equivalent of the Academy Awards. In 2017, Liew’s The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye won three Eisner Awards. However, this is not the only comic book to have attained international success. Moving Forward is a short comic by Drewscape (whose real name is Andrew Tan) that was nominated for an Eisner Award for Best Short Story in 2013.3

Another award-winning comic book is Koh Hong Teng’s Ten Sticks and One Rice (2012) which clinched the third prize at the 7th International Manga Awards 2014 in Japan. In 2009, Koh had adapted Dave Chua’s award-winning novel Gone Case into a two-volume comic book. (Gone Case is a coming-of-age story set in a public housing estate, which won the Singapore Literature Commendation Prize in 1996.)

Many popular comic books in Singapore today are autobiographical or semi-autobiographical. Lim Cheng Tju, an educator and an author and editor of comic books, notes that while autobiographical comics are considered an alternative genre in the United States, they are considered mainstream in Singapore. The majority of comic artists in Singapore are hobbyists and rely on government grants to fund their comic book projects.4 With many comic artists choosing to tell personal stories or pursue passion projects instead of trying to appeal to the mass market, the autobiographical genre has become mainstream here. 

Ten Sticks and One Rice is an example of this phenomenon. Produced by Koh Hong Teng together with Oh Yong Hwee, it is based on the creators’ hawker parents. Another example is Troy Chin’s The Resident Tourist series of graphic books. These recount interesting snippets of Chin’s life in Singapore as a “tourist” following his return here after a nine-year stint in the United States.5

More recently, we have Chronicles of a Circuit Breaker by cartoonist Joseph Chiang. Between April and June 2020, Singapore entered a “circuit breaker” period where schools and most workplaces were closed to break the chain of infection resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic. In his book, Chiang documents life during the two months and summarises some key lessons that he learnt from the period.

#### **Launchpads for Comics**

Many comic books started out as regular comic strips in the dailies. From the Straits Times, there is The House of Lim by Cheah Sin Ann and Chew on It! by Lee Chee Chew that provide incisive social commentary on Singapore and poke fun at local foibles and idiosyncrasies.

Several 联合早报 (Lianhe Zaobao) comic strips have also been compiled into volumes. Ang Thiam Poh’s 又是这一班 (You Shi Zhe Yi Ban; It’s This Class Again) is a six-volume series about school life.6 Chua Sin Yew’s 新鲜阿婆 (Xin Xian A Po; What’s New With Grandma?) is set in the local neighbourhood and looks at Singapore through the eyes of its geriatric protagonist, an incurable optimist.7

笑看城市人 (Xiao Kan Cheng Shi Ren; Looking at City Folks) by Wu Yu (whose real name is Goh Ting Cheng) is a collection of the best 500 strips from the series 朝九晚五 (Zhao Jiu Wan Wu; Nine to Five) in Lianhe Zaobao. Wu’s comic strips focus on the daily struggles of white-collar workers. Meanwhile, 新加坡啦 (Xin Jia Po La; Singapore Lah) by Goh Kar Hoe (Wu Jiahe) comments on the headlines of the day.

In Singapore, veteran comic artists have readily taken newbies under their wings. Wee Tian Beng, the creator of the Celestial Zone comic series, has mentored several artists such as Yeo Hui Shan for the Dream Walker series (2009–18), Clio Hui Kiri for A Deal with Lucifer (2015–17) and Shen Jiahui for The Makeup Toolbox (2018–19). In 2018, Johnny Lau, one of the creators of Mr Kiasu, worked with artist Rick Chen on the creation of a comic series titled SupeRich. The second volume of this comic book was published in 2020.8

There have also been efforts to raise the profile of Singaporean comic artists by promoting their works through platforms like Comix.sg, an online directory and archive of comic creators born and/or based in Singapore and their works. This directory was launched in April 2020. 

In the following sections, we look at some major comic genres and introduce interesting comics available in the National Library’s collections.

<div style="background-colour:#fff6ba; padding:20px; margin: 20px; background: #fff6ba"><b>COMIC ANTHOLOGIES</b><br><br> Anthologies are a popular format for comics. A number of collections have been published over the years and these have helped to bring many artists to prominence.<br><br>
<b>PAST...</b><br><br>
	漫画同盟 (Comics Alliance) – a four-volume anthology series published in 1997, 1998 and 2001 – is a compilation of Chinese comics by various Singaporean comic artists. The books are edited by comic veterans Wee Tian Beng and Wee See Heng.<br><br>
The Liquid City anthology, the brainchild of Sonny Liew, brought together a star-studded cast of artists who contributed short comics that have been compiled in three volumes. The series has received much attention, with volume two being nominated for Best Anthology Series at the 2011 Eisner Awards. Many of the participating artists went on to produce their own comic books. Otto Fong, a contributor to the anthology, said: “The experience of being in an anthology and working alongside other comics artists spurred my competitiveness.”9<br><br>

<b>PRESENT...</b><br><br>
	In 2015, when Singapore celebrated 50 years of independence, a comics publication titled Our Months Together, comprising 12 stories representing the 12 months in a year, was published. That same year also saw the publication of Mr Kiasu in Singapore History, which brought the titular character back to different periods in Singapore’s history.<br><br>
In 2020, the Difference Engine – an independent comics publisher based in Singapore – released its first anthology titled Sound: A Comics Anthology. The publication is a showcase of 13 comics by writers and illustrators from across Southeast Asia in response to sound.
