description: When Peng Tsu Ying came to Singapore from Shanghai in the late
  1940s, he could not find a deaf person like him. Determined to improve the
  situation for the deaf community, he founded Singapore's first school for the
  deaf in 1954. Librarian Nathaniel Chew tells us about Peng's advocacy, his own
  journey learning the Singapore Sign Language and the different ways it has
  evolved.
