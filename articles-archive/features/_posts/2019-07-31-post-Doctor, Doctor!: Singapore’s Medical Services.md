#### Milestones in Singapore’s medical scene – among other subjects – are captured through fascinating oral history narratives in a new book written by **Cheong Suk-Wai** and published by the National Archives of Singapore.

Life is a race against time. That much was clear to midwife **Sumitera Mohd Letak** after she helped a patient with dangerously high blood pressure who had just given birth. “She was bleeding like hell”,Sumitera recalled. “Her baby was gasping away and I had to suck mucus out of her baby’s mouth… I had to, by hook or by crook, take them to hospital”.

Alas, the mother, baby and midwife were on St John’s Island, which is about 6.5 km south of mainland Singapore. What was worse, it was the middle of the night. Sumitera added: “It was low tide, so I had to wake up the whole row of people in the quarters there to give me a helping hand”. The roused boatmen put the ailing mother and baby in a big *sampan*. Sumitera and the woman’s husband and mother climbed in too and they rushed to Jardine Steps at Keppel Harbour. Upon their arrival, the ambulance from Kandang Kerbau (KK) Hospital was nowhere in sight, so Sumitera left the woman in the care of her husband and the harbour police.

She flagged down a taxi and, with the baby in her arms and its grandmother in tow, rushed to KK Hospital. Sadly, the baby died there, but its mother was saved. “She was in hospital for three weeks because her blood pressure did not come down” ,Sumitera recalled, adding that, fortunately, “the hospital treated her for free”.

Sumitera, who was born in 1942, joined Singapore’s medical service as a midwife in the 1960s. She was among those in the Public Health Division who went out in “travelling dispensaries” twice a month. These dispensaries were ships kitted out with a pharmacy and medical equipment. With it, she visited Singapore’s outlying islets, including Semakau, Sebarok, Sudong and Seraya. The ship would berth itself some distance away from the shore, so she had to “go right up to the island in a motorboat, and then on to the community centre”.

Well into the 1960s, healthcare in Singapore was largely rudimentary, and not just on the nation’s outlying islands. Renowned gynaecologist **Dr Tow Siang Hwa**, who headed KK Hospital in the 1960s, said that at the time, “women walked into KK Hospital to have their 12th or 15th baby. Maternal complications of the most horrendous kind were a common experience. Maternal deaths from bleeding, from obstetric complications, from obstructed labour and from malpractice outside”. Speaking to the Oral History Centre in July 1997, Tow added: “All this is never seen again today”.

Singapore’s colonial administrators had provided free clinics for the needy, but these were few and far between. “The colonial government did give us free medical care at Outram Park outpatient clinic” ,Chinatown resident **Soh Siew Cheong** recalled. In the 1960s, Tow recalled that fewer than 50 medical specialists practised in Singapore. Among those training to be one was **Dr Yong Nen Khiong**. Yong, who became a heart surgeon, recalled his college days at the University of Malaya in Singapore: “My medical cohort had 100 students. I took the bus to college every day… I was doing open heart surgery, practising on dogs”.

When Singapore attained self-government in 1959, its leaders had to overcome the most fundamental problems to give the nation a fighting chance to thrive. Founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew listed his Cabinet’s priorities as the setting up of defence forces; the provision of affordable public housing for all; the restructuring of the education system; more stringent family planning to curb over-population; and the creation of jobs for the tens of thousands who were unemployed then. Against all these pressing necessities, Lee judged the development of medical services and improvement in healthcare to be, perhaps, fifth or sixth on his list of to-dos. To compound matters, the government was strapped for cash.

So Singaporeans made do, as they always had, with traditional folk medicine or, more often, store-cupboard remedies.

**Eugene Wijeysingha**, a former Principal of Raffles Institution, recalled that, as a boy, he cut his foot deeply while running around barefoot playing cops and robbers with his mates. “Blood was dripping and we went to someone’s house nearby”, he said. “They got a piece of cloth, put coffee powder and sugar on it, and wrapped the cloth round and round my foot. They hadn’t cleaned it first. But the wound healed; no tetanus or anything like that”.

Housewife **Yau Chung Chii** remembered well the kitchen-table wisdom passed down to her generation. Speaking in Cantonese, Yau said, for example, that pregnant women would avoid lamb, lest it gave their babies epilepsy. Upon giving birth, women would be fed pig’s trotters stewed with ginger and black vinegar, a dish thought to be effective in ridding their bodies of gas. She added that, however, some mothers told their doctors that they feared the vinegar would be so acidic that “it would melt their plastic stitches”. She added: “The doctors said, ‘No such nonsense. But if you believe it, don’t eat it’”.

This medical hall was founded by Eu Tong Sen, after whom the street is named, who treated the ailments of the humblest folk. Eu Yan Sang has since grown into a globally renowned brand. <i>Ministry of Information and the Arts Collection, courtesy of National Archives of Singapore.</i></div>

The Malays had plant-based pastes and potions for women in confinement. Midwife Sumitera remembered two – *param* and *jamu*. “*Param* was a herbal concoction that you rubbed all over the mother’s body. It opened the pores, out of which impurities oozed… if you went near those using *param*, they smelled so sweet, [with] none of that fishy afterbirth smell which was caused by the poor flow of blood”.

*Jamu* was consumed to expel any blood clots after giving birth. “It’s a spicy herbal paste; you mixed it with water and drank it. It also helped the womb contract and return to normal size faster”. Sumitera never forgot how basic the islanders’ lives were even after Singapore became independent. Women and girls who were menstruating folded cloth, into which they crumpled newspaper, to stanch their bleeding. They would not heed Sumitera’s advice to use the sanitary pads that she distributed to them regularly. “They said they would keep it and use it only when they travelled to mainland Singapore”.
