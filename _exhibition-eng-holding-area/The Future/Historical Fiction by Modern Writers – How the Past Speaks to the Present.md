#### **Introduction**
Picture Song Dynasty scholars delivering equality manifestos on the streets of Kaifeng, or late Ming generals rallying military households with the cry that nation comes before family… Historical fiction subtly reveals how contemporary values permeate these narratives. This phenomenon of temporal displacement in storytelling essentially stems from writers using literary techniques to reinterpret history, reflecting our contemporary spiritual need to reshape cultural memory.

#### **Reviewing History, Reflecting on the Future**
I have led reading sessions for several historical novels, including "A Common Soldier in the Late Ming Border Forces,"1 " Special Forces Sniper: Back to the Three Kingdoms," 2 and " Forged by Beacon Fires." 3 During these sessions, fellow readers frequently inquire about the historical events of those periods, displaying keen interest in their authenticity. They also occasionally pose hypothetical questions: what might have happened if historical figures had made different choices? All of this encourages fellow readers to contemplate and reflect upon the future. Through such reflection, we become better equipped to make wiser choices on our future paths. The ancient wisdom of "learning from history" is not merely empty rhetoric—it holds genuine, practical value.

#### **Modern Elements in Historical Fiction**
Many historical novels include time-travel storylines that arise naturally from authors' extensive reading, reflection, and creative imagination. These stories often weave modern ideas into historical settings through carefully chosen details. In numerous alternate history novels, protagonists typically use their knowledge to advance technology, build wealth, and improve society. In stories modelled after Ming and Qing dynasty tales, merchants championing fair contracts reflect modern free-market principles. Writers are essentially inserting today's values into yesterday's world, using historical periods as laboratories for contemporary issues.

#### **Leading Discussions on Historical Fiction**
By leading discussions on historical fiction, reading clubs can bring together like-minded readers for meaningful exchange. While these novels often blur historical accuracy by incorporating modern elements, discussion leaders can help readers distinguish between fact and fiction by thoroughly preparing historical source materials, thereby sparking deeper discussions. When popular films and television series are released, reading clubs can capitalise on this momentum to heighten readers' interest in the relevant historical periods. This combination of media and reading guidance not only deepens readers' understanding of specific historical periods but also motivates more people to visit libraries and explore historical truth for themselves.

#### **Conclusion**
Leading historical fiction discussions in reading clubs significantly enhances cultural understanding and fosters reading enthusiasm. Interest is what drives these groups at every stage—it brings them together initially, helps them grow over time, and will guide their future development.
