<div style="background-color: white;">The Medical Office at the junction of North Bridge and Bras Basah roads, c. 1900s. Founded in 1892 by German chemist Emil Kahlert, this was one of Singapore’s earliest Western-style pharmacies. Its history has been eclipsed by the better known Medical Hall, a landmark for many years on Battery Road and established at least two decades earlier by another German, a doctor named Christopher Trebing. <i>Courtesy of Foo Suan Dick and Foo Suan Wee.</i></div>
