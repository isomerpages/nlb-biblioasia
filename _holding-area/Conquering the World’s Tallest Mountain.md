#### David Lim led the first Singapore expedition team that successfully scaled Mount Everest on 25 May 1998. This is an excerpt from his book,<i>Mountain to Climb: The Quest from Everest and Beyond.</i>

By David Lim

On 29 May 1953, New Zealander mountaineer and explorer Edmund Hillary and sherpa Tenzing Norgay made history by becoming the first people to summit Mount Everest. Straddling the border of Nepal and Tibet, the world’s highest peak has borne witness to both great accomplishment and tragedy.

Standing at 8,849 m (29,032 ft), the ascent up Everest[^1] requires years of preparation and training. The climb is treacherous no thanks to heavy snow, slippery slopes, strong winds and avalanches. At such high altitudes, climbers are also susceptible to serious conditions like pulmonary edema, cerebral edema, blood embolisms, frostbite and altitude sickness.[^2]

In May 2023, Singaporean Shrinivas Sainis Dattatraya, 39, went missing during an attempt to climb Everest. He had reached the summit on 19 May but developed high-altitude cerebral edema and told his wife he was “unlikely to make it down the mountain”. Attempts to locate Shrinivas were unsuccessful and, in an Instagram post, his wife paid tribute to her husband noting that “…he lived fearlessly and to the fullest. He explored the depth of the sea and scaled the greatest heights of the Earth. And now, Shri is in the mountains, where he felt most at home.”[^3]

This event comes 25 years after mountaineer and climber David Lim led the first Singapore expedition to successfully conquer Everest.[^4]  On 25 May 1998, Outward Bound Singapore instructor Edwin Siew became the first member from the team to reach the summit. He was followed by systems analyst Khoo Swee Chiow half an hour later. Lim himself did not make it to the summit due to an injury sustained during the climb.
Unfortunately, one week after the team’s return, Lim was stricken with Guillain–Barré syndrome, a rare nerve disorder. Within days, his limbs were paralysed and his respiratory system shut down. Unable to speak, move or breathe, Lim endured 42 days in intensive care before his condition stabilised. He then spent six months recuperating in the hospital, where he had to re-learn basic skills such as writing, dressing himself and walking. Undeterred, Lim returned to mountaineering and has led more than 15 climbing expeditions since 1999, including the first all-Singaporean ascent of Aconcagua (6,961 m) in the Andes Mountain range in Argentina. 
Mountain to Climb: The Quest from Everest and Beyond (1999) is Lim’s personal account of Singapore’s quest to climb Everest, including the failures, heartbreak and sacrifices. In this excerpt from Chapter 19, Lim recounts the events leading up to the team’s first attempt to summit Everest on 19 May 1998.
