**About**:	Youth Readers Club is a dedicated literary community that brings together young people aged 17 to 25 who share a passion for reading and intellectual exploration. The club maintains a structured yet flexible programme, hosting eight book discussion sessions annually on the fourth Sunday of each month at the library. Our book selections span a wide array of fields and disciplines, reflecting the diverse interests and academic pursuits of our young adult membership. The club's primary focus lies in fostering in-depth reading and meaningful exchange amongst participants.
