The implementation of English law in Singapore, along with Penang and Melaka, is detailed in Roland St. John Braddell’s landmark The Law of the Straits Settlements: A Commentary. Although this book 
is not the first attempt at documenting the 
legal history of Singapore, it has, nonethe
-
less, contributed significantly to its study, 
and is regarded as a classic by scholars 
even today.
1
Singapore’s legal system can trace 
its origins to the British colonial era when 
it first adopted the English legal system. 
The First Charter of Justice Singapore 
was established on 6 February 1819, when 
Stamford Raffles signed a treaty with Sultan 
Husain Shah of Johor and Temenggung 
Abdul Rahman to establish a trading post 
in Singapore. Earlier in 1807, the British 
Crown had granted the British East India 
Company the First Charter of Justice to 
establish a Court of Judicature in Penang.

As Singapore’s population increased 
and commercial activity grew, it became 
clear that the administration of law on the 
island was inadequate to prevent and con
-
trol crime. The promulgation of the Second 
Charter of Justice on 27 November 1826 
– the year Singapore became part of the 
Straits Settlements together with Melaka 
and Penang – marked a watershed in Sin
-
gapore’s legal history. The charter created 
the Court of Judicature of Singapore, Prince 
of Wales Island (Penang) and Melaka. It 
also introduced a single system of law and 
order for all inhabitants of Singapore and 
established a proper legal system based 
on English common law.3
