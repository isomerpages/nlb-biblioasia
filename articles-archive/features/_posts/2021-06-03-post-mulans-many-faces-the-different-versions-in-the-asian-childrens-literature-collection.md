#### **Lee Meiyu** looks back at the life of rubber tycoon Tan Lark Sye, long-time chairman of Hokkien Huay Kuan and the founder of the former Nanyang University in Singapore.

In October 2019, a ceremony was held at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) to mark the renaming of a road. Originally called Nanyang Valley, the small road leading to the Chinese Heritage Centre was renamed Tan Lark Sye Walk at an event attended by then Minister for Education Ong Ye Kung.[^1]
