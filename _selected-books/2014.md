#### <a target="_blank" href="/vol-11/issue-2/jul-sep-2015/stories" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">Living the Singapore Story: Celebrating Our 50 Years (1965−2015) </a>
<p>This book contains 50 specially curated items from the Rare Materials Collection, researched and written by a team of librarians from the National Library. Each article in this book contains a detailed description of the rare item as well as highlights of its history and provenance. Distilling 50 items from a 19,000-strong collection was a challenging task, and the final selection is at best only a representative snapshot of the complete repository.
