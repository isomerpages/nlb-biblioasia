####  Letterpress printing may be obsolete today but the tools involved continue to be objects of fascination.

The history of printing in Singapore goes back about 200 years when Christian missionaries first arrived in the region and introduced the technology – letterpress printing – with the aim of spreading the gospel.

A form of relief printing where ink is applied to a raised surface which is then pressed onto paper, letterpress printing was the main commercial printing method for printing books and newspapers until the late 20th century. It was eventually overtaken by newer commercial printing technologies that were more efficient and economical.

This article showcases some of the letterpress printing equipment used here between the 1950s and 1980s. These equipment from a bygone era were salvaged by Sun Yao Yu, founder of Typesettingsg, a studio he set up in 2014 to preserve and document Singapore’s printing heritage. From hand-carved wooden type to manually operated presses, these items showcase the technology and craftsmanship that once formed the backbone of Singapore’s printing industry.
