<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Hi, everyone. I’m Jimmy Yap, and I’m Chief Editor of BiblioAsia, a publication
of the National Library of Singapore. In today’s episode, we’re going to
dive into the <a href="https://biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg/vol-19/issue-3/oct-dec-2023/acehnese-chinese-gold-coins/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">mystery of two ancient gold coins</a> that
were discovered in Singapore in the middle of the 19th century, and that
later went missing. With me today is Foo Shu Tieng, a librarian of the
National Library, who is also an archeologist. She’s written about these
coins in BiblioAsia. And she’s going to help us to get to the bottom of
this mystery. Welcome back to BiblioAsio+, Shu. How are you?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Shu</strong> 
<br>Good. How are you?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>I’ve been very good, although it’s been a hot day.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Shu</strong> 
<br>[Laughs]
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Can you start off by telling us more about these coins? When and where
would they be found?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Shu</strong> 
<br>Okay, so picture this in the early parts of Singapore’s history: it was
actually a penal colony. And so around 1840, they were trying to build
a road to the New Harbour, which is now Keppel Harbour. And so these convicts,
when they were actually building the road, they discovered some coins.
So it’s possible that the coins might have been part of a settlement or
it’s possible that they might have been part of a graveyard. We don’t know.
There was a map that I found that’s now with NUS [National University of
Singapore]. I think it’s part of the Singapore Land Authority collection
that actually depicts the area in the 1840s. And so we think that’s the
best shot.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Unfortunately, there’s just a few houses depicted on the map, and so we’re
not quite sure what happened back then. The land belonged to the sultan
or actually the Temenggong Daeng Ibraham. basically the Temenggong actually
purchased them from the convicts. And eventually in 1849, when the Singapore
Library was set up and all that, he actually donated them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And so the Straits Settlements Governor, Butterworth, actually presented
them on behalf of the Temenggong. And so the Singapore Library had it on
display in the reading room, just like you’ll see some of the paintings
displayed in our reading room today. And so, in 1870, in the ‘60s and ‘70s,
the Singapore Library then went into, let’s say, financial difficulties.
It was because of a few factors. There were things like the majority of
readership actually being the military. And so when they actually had to
leave Singapore, much of the readership actually pulled out. And so that
initial base was actually no longer there. And so when they fell into financial
difficulties, that’s when they had to move libraries.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So I think this is the most likely time when it went missing. Maybe there
was an administrative transfer somewhere else. And so I was trying to figure
out, okay, if the coins were discovered during this period, where could
they have gone? And so I looked through other important early coins to
figure out: okay, this coin went here, this coin was there. And so from
there, possibly people can try and see whether or not they can trace back
to that discovery. But, you know, this is not just the only, you know,
possibility. There could be other times when the coins went missing.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>So Shu Tieng, that’s very interesting. But do we know that the coins weren’t
stolen rather than, you know, transferred out?
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Shu</strong> 
<br>Actually, we don’t. There’s a couple of possibilities. One was that after
the fall of Singapore in September 1942, I found a Singapore library report
mentioning that someone had actually broken a glass exhibition case and
that ten ancient gold coins were taken from the Raffles Museum itself.
So the Raffles Library and Museum actually inherited the Singapore library
materials. So if the coins were still at the museum, this is the next possibility,
right? But the reason why I think it might have must have happened before
is that when I was looking through the exhibition lists of items at the
Raffles Museum, I wasn’t able to find the coins.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So this is why I think they might have been transferred earlier. So I
use an Occam’s Razor kind of thing – that sometimes the simplest explanation
is probably… I mean, it’s not very sexy. You know, there were other break-ins,
and so it might have been one of the break-ins at the Raffles Museum in
the 1890s, for example. When they wrote <em><a href="https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/redir/itemdetails?bid=6203718" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">One Hundred Years of Singapore</a></em>,
all they have is basically the transliteration of the coins. So that’s
what I think happened.
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>This is theft of artefacts. Is that like a relatively common thing in
the museum world?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Shu</strong> 
<br>Actually, yes. It’s actually a fairly common thing. I don’t know if you’ve
read the newspaper articles recently, but I think in August [2023], the
British Museum alone mentioned more than 1300 artifacts stolen recently.
It’s fairly common, often surprisingly related to the either crime syndicates,
or sometimes terrorist funding. So these are, you know, issues that plague
us all. But if you want to know a good book about this particular issue,
there’s a book called <em><a href="https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=204463768" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Southeast Asia’s Past: Objects Museums and Restitution</a></em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>So what is the significance of these coins? What does it tell us about
Singapore’s history?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Shu</strong> 
<br>So I think this might surprise you about ancient Singapore: the majority
of the coins that we find in archaeological excavations from, let’s say,
the 14th century are mostly Northern Song. So these are coins from the
Northern Song Dynasty. They date from, I guess 11th to, I would say like
the 12th century. The majority are from there because they’re considered
expired coins. So when China and Southeast Asia came to trade, they would
use this as sort of like the worth in metal value, right? And so in Southeast
Asia, there was a booming trade in East Java. For example, the Majapahit
actually used these coins to pay for fines officially and things like that.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And so Singapore was probably using these coins for long distance trade,
that kind of thing. But we’re not sure. There’s a lot of evidence to indicate
that Singapore at the time was in contact with a lot of different traders
along the Malay Peninsula and also in Sumatra. And so the significance
of these two coins in particular is that they’re actually Islamic. They
depict a very different period from the 17th century, which we thought
that was maybe, you know, this 14th century period, which is the Temasek
period. And then later on, you know, there was a fishing village in 1890.
That’s like the general Singapore history, right? Over time in the past
couple of decades, historians have actually started to uncover more historical
documents that say that in the 17th, 18th century, actually, there was
something else in Singapore.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So these coins actually show that there was something happening here,
especially at Telok Blangah, what there was and to what extent. A scholar
by the name of Dr. Peter Borschberg at the National University of Singapore
found a particular, I think it’s like archival material, about a Flemish
gem trader by the name of Jacque de Couture. And he mentioned that, you
know, in Sentosa there was Orang Laut and trade. So there was a harbourmaster
in the area. So I suspect that this coin might be related to that. And
so maybe these coins were used for regional trade.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>It shows that there was economic activity in the 17th century in Singapore,
right? And it might have something to do with trade with Aceh as well.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Shu</strong> 
<br>That’s right.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>So Shu Tieng, you decided to do something interesting with these coins,
because actually there are no photos of these coins. We don’t know really
what they look like, but we do have the texts. We do know what was written
on the coins. They were written in Jawi, and they were then transliterated,
but you decided it just wasn’t good enough. What made you decide to relook
the transcriptions on these coins?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Shu</strong> 
<br>When I was looking at the original 1849 Singapore Library report, I realised
that the transliteration was wrong. I was comparing them to more modern
research about the coins, and I was looking at the coins and they didn’t
make sense. So I suspected that it might have been wrong. And so I think
it might have been an issue with like thinking that there are similar words.
It’s like having like in Chinese, for example, just one stroke or a couple
of strokes wrong could be something completely different, right? And so
I thought this could have also happened with the coins because it’s in
Arabic script. The coins might not have been very good copies. They might
have been worn. And so I asked a couple of my colleagues to actually help
me try to figure this out.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So basically what I did was I brought over the books that had the Arabic
versions of the names of kings in Aceh. And then I asked them to transliterate
the English versions back into Jawi. And then I compared these to see whether
or not there were similar names or similar symbols. And since the two coins
had something in common, the sort of backside of the coin. So I suspected
that they might have been from the same king or similar dynasty or something
like that. So that’s where we started our journey. And from there we propose
a theory. Of course, you know, researchers can always chime in with other
theories, but we really think that this is probably one of the most…</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Plausible.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Shu</strong> 
<br>Plausible explanation, basically.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Yeah. Okay. Have you heard back from anyone? I mean, you must, having
done the transliteration of these coins into and gotten a new sort of translation.
For example, did John Miksic say anything?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Shu</strong> 
<br>Unfortunately, John Miksic is not versed in Jawi. So somebody who is actually
versed in Jawi would be able to do further research. So there has been
great interest [especially from] people from Malaysia, because I think
in Malaysia, Jawi is actually, you know, a potential course that you can
learn during your schooling days. So anybody can, you know, sort of try
and see what it means on their own. And so that could be something else
we can, you know, look forward to in the next 5 to 10 years, hopefully.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>So has anyone been in touch with you about your article?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Shu</strong> 
<br>Dr. William Gibson. He was studying about <em>keramat</em> in Telok Blangah.
He contacted me recently because the coins are obviously found in Telok
Blangah area. And so he was looking at <em>keramat</em> in the area. And
so he saw that, hey, this is something interesting. So yeah, so we compared
notes, and he does think that the first coin is correct. The second coin
is still you know up for grabs. But I think, you know, we have one of the
plausible answers, if not the plausible answer.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Okay, that’s great. We have the Malay coins and mainly Northern Song coins.
Anything else?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Shu</strong> 
<br>Primarily Northern Song coins. But the earliest coins that we found actually
date from the Tang Dynasty. With the discovery of the shipwreck artifacts,
it’s possible that there are more. So I haven’t looked at all the materials
yet, but from the ones that I’ve seen from the land-based sites, they’re
mostly from the Northern Song period. But Tang Dynasty ones, I mean, they
could have been heirloom objects, that kind of thing. So it’s difficult
to say.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Thank you very much, Shu Tieng, for that very interesting overview of
the mysterious coins that were found in Singapore. For more information
about these amazing coins and how Shu Tieng sort of reverse engineered
the whole transliteration process, please read the <a href="https://biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg/vol-19/issue-3/oct-dec-2023/acehnese-chinese-gold-coins/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">article</a> in <em>BiblioAsia</em>.
But we’ve now come to that part of the interview where we do quickfire
questions. So Shu Tieng, tell me a common misconception about archaeology
that really annoys you.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Shu</strong> 
<br>The most often annoying question is they think archaeology is about finding
dinosaurs.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Oh, really?
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Shu</strong> 
<br>Yeah. So just to be clear, it’s paleontology. If you’re interested in
dinosaurs, if you’re interested in archaeology, it’s about humans. So just
to make that clear, it’s a few million years apart.
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>So yeah, okay. It’s an archeological, not paleontological. What’s an archeological
mystery that you would like to solve, you know, besides this, all these
gold coins?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Shu</strong> 
<br>Okay, so other than coins, another ancient trading item was cowrie shells.
So it basically performs the same function as the coins, but it’s a little
harder to study because obviously there are fewer written records about
it. But they use these cowrie shells during the slave trade, and they use
them all up to like the mid-19th century. And so in Singapore there’s some
remnants of it. You can see like it’s often mentioned, cowrie shells, in
trading reports. But to what extent and you know how big the trade was,
that’s a question to be answered. So that’s something that I’d be interested
in studying. Yeah.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>What is the cowrie shell? I mean, is it a seashell?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Shu</strong> 
<br>It’s a seashell, yes.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Does it look like a snail?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Shu</strong> 
<br>It’s about the size of your thumb, if you look down at it. People have
started using the shells as sort of money probably since the 8th century
onwards. And so we suspect it goes back even further. But the historical
evidence is a bit rare. So they go all the way from Africa, all the way
to Thailand, Vietnam, even some parts of Southern China. And so there was
this cowrie trade that was going back and forth. The Dong Son drums you
can see in the museums in Southeast Asia – those actually were full of
cowry shells in southern China.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In Southeast Asia, for example, the Dong Son drums are there, but without
cowrie shells. We don’t know why. So there’s some weird thing going on,
right? For example, in Sukhothai, they were using these cowry shells often
for small change. And so this extended all the way south to the Kedah area.
But whether they extend it all the way south to Johore or even Singapore,
that’s another question.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>What is your favourite archeological movie or archeological pop culture
moment?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Shu</strong> 
<br>The Tomb Raider game that was rebooted. I think it was maybe 2013. So
maybe it’s an older game. But I saw there was a Southeast Asian plot inside
as one of the artifacts there. I was like, “Oh, yes, they thought of us.”
Ban Chang pottery. This is the moment for us to shine, that kind of thing.
So that was my favourite moment, but I’m not sure if others would feel
the same.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Complete the sentence: Archeology is....</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Shu</strong> 
<br>Archeology is life.
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>What does that mean?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Shu</strong> 
<br>It’s knowing that the past is discoverable, and so it gives you life’s
mission. And so the library also is sort of gives you a mission where you
think that the past is discoverable, right? So we’re all working in concert,
basically.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>And what are you working on now?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Shu</strong> 
<br>You’ll be surprised, but it’s nothing to do with archeology. I’m working
on a couple of encyclopedia articles on the paramedic and ambulance.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Okay. I’m not sure this will make it to the final cut.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Shu</strong> 
<br>Okay, but that’s what I’m working on. Honestly.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
