This is the first comprehensive anthology to bring together, in a single volume, representative texts from all the English-language literature of Southeast Asia. The poetry, drama and prose fiction collected in this anthology provides numerous insights into the historical emergence of Southeast Asian countries and into the contemporary social concerns in these rapidly changing societies. For Southeast Asian readers, the anthology introduces new possibilities in imagining regional identities. For readers outside Southeast Asia, it provides a stimulating introduction to the richness of the region's literature in English, bringing together both well-known and hitherto neglected texts of outstanding literary quality.
