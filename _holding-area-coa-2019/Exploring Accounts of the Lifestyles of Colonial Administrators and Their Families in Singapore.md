#### **Introduction**

In 1900, British traveller and sometime political activist Ethel Colquhoun
visited Singapore during a tour of the Pacific with her husband, an imperial
administrator and explorer. During a stay of several days, she recorded
her views on the landscape and society that she observed. One of the
most striking and critical passages of her account deals with Singapore’s
European residents:


  *They live in the baleful atmosphere of a hothouse. They are exiles<br> 
  and prisoners on a cramped little island, from which they cannot<br> 
  even escape for a short holiday at times, only to go “home”. They<br> 
  naturally get to regard Singapore as the hub of the universe, and<br> 
  to feel as if the whole creation centred round their tiny world of<br> 
  small civil, military and mercantile duties. They can’t exercise<br> 
  charity to their poorer neighbours – for neither Chinese nor Malays<br>  are exactly subjects for my Lady Bountiful – so that it is not<br>  perhaps wonderful that that much-abused virtue gets rusty in their<br>    intercourse with social equals*.1

Throughout the period 1870–1920, during which Singapore was
administered as part of the Crown Colony of the Straits Settlements within
the British Empire, visitors and residents were keen to record their thoughts
on the island’s European community. While some accounts were written
by travellers passing through, others recorded the experiences of men and
women who had spent longer periods living and working in British Malaya.

Colquhoun’s comments reflect several key themes that appear throughout
many contemporary accounts. Discussions of the nature of society are
rooted in ideas of separation and isolation, the relationship with Britain as
“home”, and interactions between racial and occupational groups. While
many accounts follow Colquhoun’s lead and criticise the way of life they
observe among the European population, others present a more favourable
view, highlighting the perceived benefits of a tropical lifestyle, the strengths
of the small European community in Singapore and what they believed
were improvements to the outlook and living conditions of Chinese,
Malays and Indians as a result of “the presence of English law and…the
protection of the British flag”.2 While an individual’s views are to an extent
attributable to personal experience, position and perspective, there are wider
themes and ideas relating to the ideologies that structured late 19th- and
early 20th-century colonial society, which are important to consider when
exploring these accounts and the views their authors express.
