#### From Desker Road to Xilin Avenue, street signs around Singapore recall the lives of people whose stories are a part of the nation’s history.
By Jimmy Yap

<i>Singapore Street Names: A Study of Toponymics</i> was first published in 2003 and is now into its fourth edition. The fact that it has gone through so many updates is a testament to its enduring popularity.

The work is co-authored by Victor Savage and Brenda Yeoh. When the book was first published two decades ago, both authors were colleagues at the Geography department at the National University of Singapore (NUS). Today, Yeoh continues to be a Professor with the department. She is also the Raffles Professor of Social Sciences at the university and is the research leader of the Asian Migration Research Cluster at the Asia Research Institute. Savage is a visiting fellow at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies at Nanyang Technological University. Previously the head of the Geography department at NUS, he was also a director with the Office of Alumni Relations at the university.

In this interview, which has been condensed and edited for clarity, Jimmy Yap speaks to Savage to find out about how the book originally came about. Savage also recounts the stories behind how some of the entries were corrected or updated and reveals which road names gave him the biggest headaches.
