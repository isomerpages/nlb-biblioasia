---
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>
<br>So it's really a very random story. I was reading a post on Reddit, and
I saw a comment that Tila Tequila, who is an American model and social
media personality, was born in Singapore to refugee parents from Vietnam.
So that really intrigued me because I thought, “Wow, we had refugees?”
We took in refugees at one point; I didn't know that we ever did.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So it was really unexpected that someone might have been born here to
parents who came here as refugees. That really just made me google “Singapore
refugee camp”. And then to my surprise, there were results. So were the
results about the Hawkins Road camp.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did go and conduct more primary research so that they involved talking
to people who lived in a refugee camp previously, as well as those who
had volunteered in the camp, such as by teaching English. So I would say
those were really very useful in terms of finding out more about what they
thought of the camp, and what their life was like day to day and their
eventual resettlement.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>You’re listening to <em>BiblioAsia+</em>, a podcast produced by the National
Library of Singapore. At <em>BiblioAsia</em>, we tell stories about Singapore’s
past. Some familiar, others forgotten, all fascinating.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>Mention Hawkins road to most Singaporeans today and you're likely to get
a blank look. The road used to be in Sembawang, but it doesn't exist anymore.
Few people remember that from the late 1970s to the mid 1990s, <a href="https://biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg/vol-20/issue-3/oct-dec-2024/hawkins-road-refugee-camp/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Hawkins road</a> had
a camp [for] Vietnamese refugees who fled the country after the fall of
Saigon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The event triggered a massive outflow of people escaping Vietnam in tiny
boats, resulting in what was then known as the Vietnamese refugee crisis.
Singapore took in some of those refugees belonging to a particular category.
However, some of those refugees ended up stranded at Hawkins Road Camp
for years, much, much longer than anticipated. Rebecca Tan is here today
to tell us more about the Hawkins Road refugee camp.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A digital preservation archivist with National Archive Singapore, Rebecca
wrote about a camp in <em>BiblioAsia</em>. Welcome to the show, Rebecca.
How are you?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>
<br>I'm good. Thank you.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Thank you for joining us and actually, we’re joining you, right? Because
actually, this is your this is your hood, we are at the National Archives.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>
<br>Yes, yes, we are in a recording studio.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Yes. It's a lovely recording studio, I hope. I wish everybody else could
see this. So tell me more, actually, about the Hawkins Road refugee camp,
you know. When did it start up and how many refugees could it hold?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>
<br>So the camp was actually started in 1978 because shortly after the fall
of Saigon in Vietnam, there were thousands and thousands of refugees fleeing
Vietnam. So there was a huge demand for the camp. And in fact, this refugee
camp wasn't the only one in the region. There were others in other places
like Malaysia and Indonesia as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the camp was meant to hold about 1,000 refugees. So the government
meant for all the refugees, each time after they came in, to leave within
three months.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>But that didn't happen, right?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>
<br>So they were actually coming to the refugee camp [that] was really extremely
full. And some people ended up staying in the camp for maybe even six months,
or even close to a year or years at a time.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Yeah. Okay. We'll get back to that a little bit later but what was life
in the refugee camp like?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>
<br>At first I thought maybe people would just go about their daily lives
doing chores, but the refugees actually found ways to make life more pleasant
and enjoyable. So they actually got to undergo vocational and even language
training.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>
<br>So in the camp, there were actually volunteer English teachers, both Singaporean
and foreign teachers who help to give language classes to the refugees
living in the camp. And in fact, some of the refugees every now and then
also got to go out and explore different towns, especially those in northern
Singapore, like Sembawang or Marsiling. And there were a few trips for
the kids.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh okay, where did the kids go to?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>
<br>There were different places that they went to. So one of the refugees
that I interviewed for this article actually mentioned that he remembered
going to the Singapore Zoo.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay, everybody goes to the zoo. What did you find surprising about your
research into the Hawkins Road refugee camp?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>
<br>Some refugees got to take up employment in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh, okay.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>
<br>So, specifically, those are the refugees who ended up staying really much
longer than expected. This didn't make it into the article, but I read
in a June 1996 <em>Straits Times</em> article that a UNHCR representative
or the United Nations High Commission for Refugees.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Yeah, that's right. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>
<br>Yes. So he mentioned that the camp was not [a] closed refugee camp. In
fact, those who had to stay in the camp for a really long time, I think
towards the end of the camp’s operation, were actually able to go and find
jobs outside the camp within Singapore. So they worked as cooks, as waiters,
movers or other occupations like that, and they earn money.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, when some of these refugees left, they actually had some money
saved up already that they could bring with them.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay, that’s fantastic. So what was the compound that held the refugee
camp? What was it used before? The refugees were occupying it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>
<br>It hosted a British Army barracks. So basically, it was used for military
housing.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay. They had food and shelter. They had vocational training. What did
the people do to sort of entertain themselves when they were there? Well,
maybe not entertain, entertain is not the right word, but, you know, what
did they do with their time when they were there?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>
<br>There were some normal things they did, like just talking to one another,
resting, especially after they had just entered the camp, they were understandably
quite shaken or had to adjust to a very new environment because they had
gone through a lot. But of course, after the initial phase of adjustment,
they found other things to do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So some of the refugees, in fact, even started a magazine to talk about
their experiences escaping from Vietnam. So the magazine was called <em>Nhan Chung</em> or
Witness, and it was meant to be a monthly publication. So they really got
together to organise it. They had both Vietnamese and English versions,
and they shared the feelings and experiences they had, even including things
like their encounters with sea pirates.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Wow. Okay. But you know, these refugees, you know, you were saying that
some of them, they were not supposed to be in Singapore for very long,
right? So they were only supposed to be in Singapore for like maybe a few
months? You know what happens to them? Where would they end up going to?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>
<br>So for the refugees who were really able to leave Singapore within a few
months, they would be resettled in other countries which had agreed to
take them in. One of the conditions for them even being accepted into the
Hawkins road camp in the first place was that there had to be a third country
which would agree to receive them for resettlement subsequently. So there
were really various different countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the countries which I know the refugees went to after that included
the United States, Australia, as well as Germany. So that’s where they
went.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay. But then for some reason, you know, some refugees stayed in Hawkins
Road camp for much, much longer than they had planned, what happened?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>
<br>So those were, unfortunately, the refugees who did not get resettled as
they thought they would. This is because the countries which had previously
agreed to take them in and thought they could take them and changed their
minds about taking them in, and to be precise, there were seven of these
countries. The countries made the promises to take the refugees in when
they felt that their economies would improve, that they will be able to
host the refugees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But later on, things did not turn out as planned. And so these countries
classified the Hawkins Road refugees as people who were seeking economic
and not political refuge. And so they deemed these refugees ineligible
to be resettled over there.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay. So that's why the refugees ended up staying in Singapore for much,
much longer. So what happened then, you know, because obviously the Hawkins
Road refugee camp is no longer in existence. How did Singapore deal with
the fact that they were now hosting people that they were not planning
to host for the long term?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>
<br>So the Hawkins Road camp actually received several lease extensions. There
were certain times when the lease was supposed to be, in fact, the land
that the camp was sited on was slated for industrial development. Obviously,
that didn't quite take place as quickly as one might have thought it would.
So if I'm not wrong, there was a first lease extension a few years after
the camp opened.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then after that there was a second extension, and then a third lease
extension was requested by the UNHCR, which was administering the camp
as well, so the camp kept operating, so the refugees were able to keep
living there. But with that said, of course things did come to an end and
as we know, the camp did close.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the way that happened was eventually, around June 1996, the last remaining
refugees were sent back to Vietnam. In fact, the departure ended up being
quite a peaceful and amicable one. The refugees got to leave with the money
that they had saved up, and the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority staff
were there to see them off as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay. Did they protest about having to go back to Vietnam?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>
<br>So earlier on, before their actual departure from the camp, yes. There
were protests about having to go back to Vietnam, as well as just the shock
of finding out that they wouldn't be resettled in another country like
they thought they would be earlier. In fact, in 1992, there were some camp
residents who participated in a hunger strike upon finding out that the
seven countries which they thought they would be resettled in were not
going to accept them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So this was really quite serious. There were people who overdosed on anti-stress
pills, as well as others who lost consciousness and were taken to the hospital.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay, so it sounded pretty serious, but in the end, a solution was found
in that they were sent back to Vietnam and they did have, and they went
willingly.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>
<br>Yeah. Based on the news articles, the reports that came out at that time,
in the end, the departure went quite peacefully and the refugees already
had some money saved up to bring with them back to Vietnam as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay. For the refugees who were resettled, you know, what did they say
about Singapore?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>
<br>So generally, they all spoke very positively of their experience in Singapore
and in the refugee camp. One of the refugees that I interviewed actually
lives in Singapore again now because he was posted here for work and then
later ended up meeting his wife, who is Singaporean. And he does recall
some of his experiences when he lived in the camp as a child.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He noted that honestly compared to what he had left behind in Vietnam,
everything was just much better and in fact, quite exciting because it
was still a new environment. If you remember being taken on outings to
places like the Singapore Zoo and overall being treated quite well. In
fact, Channel NewsAsia recently published an interview with another one
of the refugees who lived in the camp, he is Mr Thao Dinh.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And in that separate article, he actually noted that the Hawkins Road
camp in Singapore was actually, from what he heard of others’ experiences,
more like a refugee haven compared to the conditions in some other camp.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>The whole experience that Singapore had with the Hawkins Road camp actually
had an impact further down the road, right. In terms of Singapore's policy
towards accepting refugees.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>
<br>Correct. So that experience made Singapore decide that they will just
not accept refugees in the future, because we are really a small country
with limited resources. In fact, the then Home Affairs Minister, Mr Wong
Kan Seng spoke in Parliament about this previously, and he noted that of
the Vietnamese refugees that we took in, were actually accepted on the
basis, on the belief that there would be a third country that would eventually
take them in, that the refugees would be able to leave in due course.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But as we now know, this really didn't happen as they planned and there
were many refugees who had to stay in Singapore in the Hawkins Road camp
for a much longer time than expected. He commented that it was like a lesson
learned and that we would not accept any refugees in the future, even if
there were promises from other countries to take them in later on.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay. You know, what were the other Southeast Asian countries that accepted
the refugees? I think you mentioned Malaysia and Indonesia?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>
<br>If you're referring to the countries which also had refugee camp, those
included the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia. Some of the refugees
in the Hawkins Road camp, including those I interviewed, actually had relatives
or family members who also left Vietnam but were sent to refugee camp that
were not in Singapore. So for a while they were separated from their family
members, and it was only upon resettlement that they all got to reunite
again in the third country.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Actually Rebecca, you know, before Singapore started accepting refugees,
they actually once turned them away. Can you tell us a little bit more
about what happened?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>
<br>So this was a few years before the Hawkins Road camp started. This was
in 1975. So back then there were, of course, also tens of thousands of
Vietnamese who were fleeing the country in boats. But the Deputy Prime
Minister at the time, Mr Lee Hsien Loong, commented that even though a
lot of these people reached Singapore and really wanted to come to Singapore,
Singapore could not take them in because it would have been swamped by
the arrival of even more refugees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And in fact, that was actually action taken to address this situation.
This was known as Operation Thunderstorm, where members of the Singapore
Armed Forces were deployed to meet with the refugees, a lot of whom were
already quite unwell and very desperate for a safe place to be. So the
SAF provided them with fuel, with food and water, but then helped to repair
the boats and just send them on their way instead of taking them in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was only later on that the Hawkins Road camp was started, after the
Singapore government had this past with the UNHCR and reached an agreement.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay, so I guess the Hawkins Road camp came up as a result of discussions
with UNHCR?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>
<br>Yes, because the UNHCR was the organisation that was administering the
camp and even when they wanted lease extensions for the camp so it would
continue operating, they had to go and talk to the Singapore government
and explain that it was because the arrival pattern of refugees was continuing.
So there would be a demand for the camp to continue operating.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>You couldn't have been born when Singapore first started hosting these
refugees. Sadly, I was already born, and, you know, and I was not a newborn
baby at that point, but yes, tell me, how did you come to know about the
refugee camp?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>
<br>So it's really a very random story. I was reading a post on Reddit, and
I saw a comment that Tila Tequila, who is an American model and social
media personality, was born in Singapore to refugee parents from Vietnam.
So that really intrigued me because I thought, “Wow, we had refugees?”
We took in refugees at one point; I didn't know that we ever did.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So it was really unexpected that someone might have been born here to
parents who came here as refugees. That really just made me google “Singapore
refugee camp”. And then to my surprise, there were results. So were the
results about the Hawkins Road camp. That really got me more interested
in the topic. And I wanted to do more research into it and write this article.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay, so tell me about the research. What was it like? Was it easy to
find the information? What did you have to do?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>
<br>So just through a basic google search, it was easy to find some basic
facts and information about the camp, like when it started, when it closed.
But honestly, for the more detailed information about really what happened
in the camp, the day-to-day lives, the lives of not even just the refugees,
but the volunteers who taught English or helped out at the camp, I would
say that was really more difficult to find.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went through a bunch of older articles on NewspaperSG, which is NLB’s
collection of digitised newspapers. So that was really extremely useful.
And from the National Archives to the archives online platform, I also
managed to find some old photos of the camp.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh, right. Okay. That's interesting. What about like oral history? Was
there any oral history mentioned?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>
<br>In terms of the oral history collection we currently have under NAS, I
couldn't find any oral history interviews that directly relate to the experiences
of people who lived in the camp. But with that said, I did go and conduct
more primary research so that they involved talking to people who lived
in refugee camp previously, as well as those who had volunteered in the
camp, such as by teaching English. So I would say those were really very
useful in terms of finding out more about what they thought of the camp,
and what their life was like day to day and their eventual resettlement.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay. So how many people did you speak to?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>
<br>I spoke to three previous residents of the camp, as well as one person
who had volunteered in the camp teaching English to the refugees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They did share some interesting things. One of the people was Vinny Nguyen
who still lives in Singapore now, so he talked a bit about what it was
like to leave Vietnam. And he actually gave an example which I think might
help some of us Singaporeans better understand what it was like. So he
said he left on a very crammed boat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He compared it to about the size of, you know, a Singapore River taxi
that you would see in the city area. But he said that on that boat they
actually crammed in 200 people.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh my goodness.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>
<br>So, one can only imagine how crowded it was over there. And then eventually
of course they reached Singapore and then he got to enter the camp.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>So looking back, you know, how has the experience of doing this article
changed you?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>
<br>I would say it's really been very interesting to hear about the experiences
of people who lived in the camp. And [it] actually gives you a lot of perspective
as to the importance and power of human resilience, because one of my interviewees
is actually much older now, and if I'm not wrong, he entered the camp when
he was in his 20s.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I myself am in my 20s, so it was unimaginable to me to think that at some
point someone else in his 20s, decades and decades ago had to become a
refugee and enter a camp and lived through such a hugely challenging and
uncertain experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Well, I can imagine it was, you know, very harrowing, to be a refugee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You're now working with the National Archives as a Digital Preservation
Archivist. What do Digital Preservation Archivists do?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>
<br>So I think everyone has some basic idea of what digital preservation is.
Basically keeping things that are important so that they can be digitally
accessed years down the road. But in fact, there is actually quite a complex
and long process behind this. So we have to ensure that government records,
so basically those from government agencies that are of historical and
national significance, are transferred to the National Archives and then
preserved in our system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This actually involves working quite a bit with our colleagues in IT,
thinking about how we can enhance our existing technical systems to preserve
these materials. And of course, liaising with stakeholders like the various
government agencies, to make sure that they transfer their records to us
as well, so that all the different processes involved in digital preservation
can be carried out successfully.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay. So I guess it means like digital. Does it mean digitising old photos
and old documents?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>
<br>Of course, digital preservation involves digitising all these old photos
and documents. So that is really one part of the process as well. But of
course a lot more materials today are in born-digital format. Things like
emails or word documents. So there is no need for digitisation of these
things but a more important thing is to ensure that they are transferred
to NAS and eventually they are arranged in a format that is suitable for
preservation in our system.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay, actually I'm interested in digital preservation because I know that
technology tends to advance and all. You know, if you look at movies taken
on old cameras or old photos and old movies, you know, have a much lower
resolution than current technologies, technology keeps moving forward.
How does the NAS sort of, you know, keep a hold of all these technologies?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>
<br>So we have different departments in NAS that deal with different formats
of items that we receive. So of course when you were talking about say
movies or videos, photos, there is the audiovisual archives as well as
a sound and moving image lab, which help in working with these materials.
But with that said, of course we as the National Archives are also always
reviewing the different formats that we accept for preservation as well,
and sharing these with government agencies so that they know the best formats
to stock their records in or their different materials in before transferring
them to us.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay, what about AI? Is AI helping or not helping, or you're not thinking
about AI at the moment?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>
<br>We are definitely thinking about how to use AI to make certain work processes
more efficient. But with that said, of course it's very hard to directly
implement or to make AI carry out the process of digital preservation simply
because it's a very huge and complex thing involving many parts of a system.
Maybe, for example, AI could help us write code or think of ways to troubleshoot
certain issues, but ultimately the whole preservation process itself, like
thinking about what to accept and what not to accept.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh yeah. Right.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>
<br>Scanning or digitising something, thinking about what kind of access rights
should be given to it is still a very human process.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay. So you're not worried about being replaced by AI anytime soon? But
could AI be useful, for example, in summarising documents? And is that
a value that they could do?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>
<br>Yes, I definitely think that that's of value and in fact, NLB, not just
with NAS, in fact, at NLB, we’ve been using AI as well to complete various
other work tasks as well as think about how we can make our library resources
more discoverable to the public.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>So, Rebecca, before you joined the National Archives, you actually worked
at the Toa Payoh library, you know, what did you do there? Not only that,
you also wrote about the Toa Payoh library for <em>BiblioAsia</em>. Tell
us about that experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>
<br>Yeah. So I did work at the <a href="https://biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg/vol-21/issue-2/jul-sep-2025/toa-payoh-public-library/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Toa Payoh library</a> for
about two and a half years as a Children and Teens librarian. And yeah,
I did write a <em>BiblioAsia</em> article on that. So it’s actually available
in the <a href="https://biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg/vol-21/issue-2/jul-sep-2025/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">NLB 30th [anniversary] issue</a> of <em>BiblioAsia</em>,
which just came out recently to celebrate NLB’s 30th anniversary as a statutory
board.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would say an advantage I had over writing this article was that I already
worked in the library, so I could talk more easily to the staff there,
take photos of the library where it is today and of course interview other
NLB staff about it. So it was a really interesting experience writing the
article.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I even learned things that surprised me. One thing for example, is that
I've always thought of libraries as the study spot. It’s where, you know,
students go to study when they really need to focus on something. But studying,
for a very long time, was just not allowed in the libraries at all. And
it was only in 2003 NLB relented on this policy and said, okay, you know,
you all can study in the libraries now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So that really made me think, okay, so where did people study last time?
If they couldn’t go to the library, I guess they would study at home or
some other places. And I actually did find the answer while researching
for this article. So after I found out that you couldn’t study in the library
previously, I found a brochure in the National Library’s collections from
the Toa Payoh library and it actually detailed study spots located near
the library. So in community centres, other nearby locations. You can actually
see an image of this brochure in the <a href="https://biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg/vol-21/issue-2/jul-sep-2025/toa-payoh-public-library/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">online version</a> of
the article.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh, that's quite cool. And tell me about your work at the Toa Payoh library.
What is it like? There must be lots of great food nearby the Toa Payoh
library.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>
<br>Food there was a lot more affordable. I would say the crowd is also quite
different.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh really? In what way?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>
<br>I would say it tends to be more of senior citizens or older people.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh, okay.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>
<br>Just due to the demographics of the town. So, that was something that
surprised me, not the demographics of the current visitors but the demographics
of past visitors, which another colleague, Roy, who worked at the Toa Payoh
library in the early 2000s shared with me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So we all, I think for a good while now, always know of HDB hub as being
at Toa Payoh. But of course in the early 2000s, they had just moved to
Toa Payoh from their previous location.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So he said after HDB Hub moved there, along with it came all the HDB employees,
the office workers. During lunch time, it was pretty common to see people
really dressed professionally or in office attire browsing the library.
But when I worked there, that was really just not something I saw very
often at all. So it was really interesting to learn about how things were
in the past and how things have changed over the years.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay. Wow. It sounds like you had a good time, as a Children and Teens
librarian. So Rebecca, complete the sentence. The archives are...&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>
<br>The archives are repositories of Singapore's history and memories.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh okay, that’s very nice. Nice way to come up with a capsule definition
of what the archive does. Rebecca, thank you very much for coming on the <em>BiblioAsia+</em> podcast.
