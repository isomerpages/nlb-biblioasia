####  From the melting pot of cultures and language in postwar Singapore emerged the search for a Malayan identity, negotiated and presented through multilingualism in Malayan literature.
By Lee Tong King

The 1950s were a decade of flux for Malaya. In the aftermath of the Japanese Occupation and prior to political independence from colonial rule, Malaya, including Singapore, was embroiled in the rise of anti-colonial sentiment and British suppression of communist insurgencies, culminating in the Emergency Act of 1948. While these intervening years were rife with ideological struggle and armed conflict, they also incubated the beginnings of distinctive Malayan literature – for instance seen though the incorporation of local vernacular into written works – thereby opening the doors to a vibrant tradition of creative writing in the region.

<b>Uniqueness of Malayan Chinese Literature</b><br>
Since the early 1950s, Chinese fiction writers in Malaya became more experimental with their language medium, which was a standard written Chinese, based on the Mandarin vernacular, or _bai hua_, hailing from the 1919 May Fourth Movement in China. The backdrop to such experimentation was a polemic, sometimes dubbed the Great Debate, that occurred between December 1947 and April 1948. This took the form of a “paper war” across the literary supplements of several major Chinese newspapers of the time, such as _Sin Chew Jit Poh_, _Nan Chiau Jit Pao_, and _Min Sheng Pau_.

There were two camps, the Malayan-Chinese Literature School and the Overseas-Chinese Literature School,[^1] that expressed opposing stances around the contentious idea of the “uniqueness of Malayan Chinese literature”. The first group believed that the Chinese literature of Malaya should be distinct from China’s, as each had developed under very different sociopolitical circumstances. The latter group, comprising the so-called “immigrant writers” (writers from China who sojourned in Malaya), sometimes derogatorily called “refugee writers”, insisted that Malayan Chinese literature was but a diasporic offshoot of Chinese literature from China and not fundamentally “unique”.[\[2\]](#_ftn2)

Twenty-five articles were exchanged in this debate, including a number by a minority of contributors who sat on the fence. While there was no clear winner of the debate, advocates of the “uniqueness of Malayan Chinese literature” eventually prevailed as a result of a historical contingency. After the British declared a state of emergency in Malaya in June 1948, the immigrant writers either voluntarily returned or were repatriated to China.[\[3\]](#_ftn3) Strict controls over imported reading material from China were imposed under the Emergency Regulations Ordinance (1948), comprising the Emergency (Publications—Import Control) Regulations and Emergency (Publications—Control of Sale and Circulation) Regulations.[\[4\]](#_ftn4) This further created a vacuum in Chinese-language literature,[\[5\]](#_ftn5) compelling Malayan Chinese writers to “seek their genius in themselves”[\[6\]](#_ftn6) and create works that spoke to locale-specific cultures and sensibilities.
