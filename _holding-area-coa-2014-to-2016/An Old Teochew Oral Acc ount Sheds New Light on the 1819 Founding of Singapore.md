#### **Introduction: The Chinese in Singapore Before Raffles**

The landing of Sir Stamford Raffles at the Singapore River on 28 January
1819 is often seen as the turning point of Singapore’s history, marking
its modern era. To no small extent, this has been influenced by the
Englishman’s writings back home, which included his famous declarations
to the Duchess of Somerset of Singapore as “my new colony” and “a child
of my own and I have made it what it is”.1 Other luminary patrons were
briefed that the settlement’s original population “scarcely amounted to 200”
before it surged to “not less than 3,000” in three months, and that in over a
year, the “insignificant fishing village” had been transformed into a “port…
surrounded by an extensive town” with “ten or twelve thousand souls,
principally Chinese”.2

These testimonies invariably aggrandised Raffles’ personal role in the founding
of Singapore. However, a recently published private correspondence dated
8 January 1819 between Raffles and East India Company (EIC) Governor
General Lord Hastings, reveals his possession, at least nine days before sailing
from Penang to Singapore, of intelligence that his intended destination
already had “about 2,000 inhabitants upon it (new settlers) under a respectable
Chief” [text in parentheses in original].3 Conspicuously, all his known
communication to England excluded this information; for instance, Raffles
had later told Hastings that “when the British flag was first hoisted, there were
not perhaps fifty-three Chinese on the island”.4

Within two days of his arrival, Raffles had the written agreement of the
local ruler, Temenggong Abdul Rahman, to set up an EI C trading factory.
This was formalised by a treaty with the former Johor Sultanate crown
prince Tengku Long (whom he assented to recognise as Sultan Hussein
Shah) and the Temenggong on 6 February 1819.5 Exactly a week later, Raffles
prepared an official report to the EIC Supreme Government in Calcutta that
contained, among other insights, a full description of ongoing economic
activities in Singapore. In his own words:

   *… the industrious Chinese are already established in the interior<br> 
   and may soon be expected to supply vegetables, and c., and c., equal<br> 
   to the demand. The port is plentifully supplied with fish and turtle,<br> 
   which are said to be more abundant here than in any part of the<br> 
   archipelago. Rice, salt, and other necessaries are always procurable<br> 
   from Siam, the granary of the Malay tribes in this quarter.<br> 
   Timber abounds in the island and its vicinity; a large part of the<br> 
   population are already engaged in building boats and vessels, and<br> 
   the Chinese of whom some are already engaged in smelting the<br> 
   ore brought from the tin mines on the neighbouring islands, and<br> 
   others employed as cultivators and artificers, may soon be expected<br> 
   to increase in a number proportionate to the wants and interests of<br> 
   the settlement…*6

Without question these were commercial activities beyond the scale of an
“insignificant fishing village” and the Chinese participation in them was
not inconsequential.

Between giving two contrasting pictures – one of a sleepy village with 200
persons and another of a bustling new settlement of 2,000 individuals –
Raffles privately admitted to a merchant in Penang that Singapore had, as
of end-January 1819, “only five hundred” persons who were “inhabitants
from Malacca and Rhio that are gone there”.7 This was as close as he got to
the truth; the first resident of Singapore, William Farquhar, independently
confirmed many years later that the Temenggong was found established
with “four or five hundred followers”.8

Another member of the 1819 expedition party, Captain John Crawford,
recalled in his diary an encounter with “upwards of 100” Chinese, who
offered themselves as labourers and were duly hired to cut down rank grass
and root out jungle near the British tents.9

Eminent Raffles scholar John Bastin considered Raffles’ acknowledgement
of the Chinese in his February 1819 official report “an interesting reference”.10

However, outside of writings that completely overlook them, these Chinese
have barely merited more than passing mentions by Singapore historians, so
as to stress the smallness of their number.11 In a recent instance, they were
even assumed to be “very lost”.12 The implication is that existing accounts of
Singapore’s modern founding have drawn on incomplete information about
an anonymous, but important, group of Chinese.

#### **An Old Teochew Oral Account**

The Teochews hailing from the eastern Guangdong Province were one of
the first resident groups of Chinese in Singapore. In the earliest-known
written description of the Chinese in Singapore by one of its own members,
prominent Teochew merchant Seah Eu Chin, it was reported in 1848 that
his “tribe” was then the largest, accounting for 19,000 out of 40,000 Chinese
in total.13

At present, nearly all published knowledge about the Singapore Teochew
community in the early half of the 19th century centres on Seah’s life and
his success as a plantation owner that earned him the nickname “Gambier
King”. However, Seah only arrived in Singapore in 1823 at a relatively young
age of 18, and a handful of late-1940s and early-1950s publications by the
Teochew community expressed an unequivocal belief that the Teochews
had been established in Singapore even before a port was opened in 1819.14

If true, then there is a good possibility that the first group of Chinese in
Singapore reported by Raffles were Teochew. However, there had been no
writings to support the grounds for the Teochews’ conviction that their
forefathers were in Singapore before Raffles, until an elucidation of how the
Teochews first arrived was presented in the 1950 publication *Teo-chews in
Malaya* (《马来亚潮侨通鉴》).

The editor of this encyclopaedic title, which focused on the background and
activities of the Teochew migrant communities in Singapore and Malaya,
was Phua Chye Long (潘醒农),15 a publisher and an office-bearer with Ngee
Ann Kongsi and Singapore Teochew Poit Ip Huay Kuan.16 He was also
the author of the relevant text that was attributed to the oral tradition. It
appears over two separate passages in the book and an English translation of
the first passage is as follows:

   *It is said that before Englishman Sir Raffles arrived, Singapore<br> 
   was a fishing village and a Malay sultan resided in Sek Lak Mung<br> 
   (石叻门)*.17<br><br>  

   *There were more than 10 persons from Hai Ior (海阳),18 who were<br> 
   all tragically killed by the Malays; and subsequently Teochew<br> 
   sojourners were recruited from Siam, and they lived at Sua Kia<br> 
   Deng (山仔顶, meaning “top of the little hill” ), which is the Wak<br> 
   Hai Cheng Bio (粤海清庙) compound of today*.19
	 
   *From Dang Khoi, Ampou (庵埠东溪), hailed two men, Heng Kim<br> 
   (王钦, a descendant of Tsap Poih Buan Seng [十八万胜]) and Heng<br> 
   Hong Sung (王丰顺), who sailed to Singapore before others and, as<br> 
   leaders of the Teochew sojourners, built Wak Hai Cheng Bio and<br> 
   formed Ngee Ann Kun (义安郡)*.20<br><br>  

   *Thereafter, whenever Teochew sojourners sailed south to Singapore,<br> 
   the red-head junks would moor in front of the temple,21 and [the<br> 
   migrants] would put up inside the premises, so that whoever<br> 
   wanted to hire a shop assistant could negotiate with them there*.<br><br>  

   *Until 1819 when Sir Raffles obtained a lease for Singapore, Sung<br> 
   Heng (顺兴) gambier plantation was their base; this is today’s<br> 
   Uang Ge Sua (王家山),22 and by then the number of the Teochew<br> 
   sojourners was already in the thousands*.23

The second write-up of what we may term, for the purposes of discussion,
as the “Teochew oral account” similarly told of two waves of arrival of the
Teochew people in Singapore, before Raffles arrived in 1819. A translation of
it reads:

   *According to the oral traditions, at the beginning a group of more<br>
   than 10 persons from Hai Ior travelled afar to Singapore, but<br>
   they were all tragically killed by local Malays. Subsequently a<br>
   number of Teochew sojourners came from Siam, and they lived at<br>
   Sua Kia Deng (that is the present Wak Hai Cheng Bio grounds)<br>
   and around Boat Quay, which became the base of the Teochew<br>
   sojourners in Singapore*.<br><br>

   *At that time the Malay ruler’s seat was at today’s Sek Lak Mung,<br>
   and though the Chinese and the natives were mixed freely, there<br>
   was peace among them*.<br><br>

   *Hailing from Dang Khoi, Ampou were Heng Kim and Heng<br>
   Hong Sung, who were the descendants of Tsap Poih Buan Seng,<br>
   a forerunner of the junk trade, and in his day leader of the<br>
   Teochew sojourners*.<br><br>

   *Thereafter the Teochew sojourners migrated south continuously and<br>
   their numbers grew by the day…*24

Except for uncertainty over whether only Heng Kim, or both Heng Kim
and Heng Hong Sung, descended from Tsap Poih Buan Seng, the two texts
can be seen to adhere to a coherent storyline.

Notwithstanding references to him as a sultan, the unnamed Malay ruler
can be readily identified as Temenggong Abdul Rahman, the Johor Chief
Minister for Justice. Holding hereditary fief over the Singapore Straits and
land on both sides (except for Riau and Lingga),25 he moved to Singapore
with 150 followers in 1811 and lived by the north bank of the Singapore
River (see Map 1) until the British compelled the relocation of his* istana*
(palace) to Telok Blangah in 1823.26

Phua confirms this identification in another section of T*eo-chews* in Malaya,
introducing Wak Hai Cheng Bio:
