#### With great power comes great responsibility. **Jacqueline Lee** and **Chiang Yu Xiang** use their power to give us an overview of the history of comics in Singapore.

Since the first comic book, The Glasgow Looking Glass – which poked fun at the fashion and politics of 19th-century Scottish society – was published in Glasgow in 1825,1 comics have become more and more mainstream and popular. Comics these days are used to educate, entertain, lampoon, satirise and provoke. 

Today, Singapore has a thriving local scene with homegrown comic book artists and writers. Life in the city-state is a fertile backdrop for many budding comic artists. As Sonny Liew, who wrote the award-winning graphic novel The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye (2015), notes: “Artists often write about what they know, so stories set in Singapore or with a local flavour are a natural step.”2

When people talk about local comics today, what come to mind are popular comic series such as Mr Kiasu and Liew’s The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye. However, there are other works by Singaporean comic book artists that are equally well received and have won awards as well.

#### **Award-winning Comics**

The Eisner Awards are sometimes referred to as the comics industry’s equivalent of the Academy Awards. In 2017, Liew’s The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye won three Eisner Awards. However, this is not the only comic book to have attained international success. Moving Forward is a short comic by Drewscape (whose real name is Andrew Tan) that was nominated for an Eisner Award for Best Short Story in 2013.3

Another award-winning comic book is Koh Hong Teng’s Ten Sticks and One Rice (2012) which clinched the third prize at the 7th International Manga Awards 2014 in Japan. In 2009, Koh had adapted Dave Chua’s award-winning novel Gone Case into a two-volume comic book. (Gone Case is a coming-of-age story set in a public housing estate, which won the Singapore Literature Commendation Prize in 1996.)

Many popular comic books in Singapore today are autobiographical or semi-autobiographical. Lim Cheng Tju, an educator and an author and editor of comic books, notes that while autobiographical comics are considered an alternative genre in the United States, they are considered mainstream in Singapore. The majority of comic artists in Singapore are hobbyists and rely on government grants to fund their comic book projects.4 With many comic artists choosing to tell personal stories or pursue passion projects instead of trying to appeal to the mass market, the autobiographical genre has become mainstream here. 

Ten Sticks and One Rice is an example of this phenomenon. Produced by Koh Hong Teng together with Oh Yong Hwee, it is based on the creators’ hawker parents. Another example is Troy Chin’s The Resident Tourist series of graphic books. These recount interesting snippets of Chin’s life in Singapore as a “tourist” following his return here after a nine-year stint in the United States.5

More recently, we have Chronicles of a Circuit Breaker by cartoonist Joseph Chiang. Between April and June 2020, Singapore entered a “circuit breaker” period where schools and most workplaces were closed to break the chain of infection resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic. In his book, Chiang documents life during the two months and summarises some key lessons that he learnt from the period.

#### **Launchpads for Comics**

Many comic books started out as regular comic strips in the dailies. From the Straits Times, there is The House of Lim by Cheah Sin Ann and Chew on It! by Lee Chee Chew that provide incisive social commentary on Singapore and poke fun at local foibles and idiosyncrasies.

Several 联合早报 (Lianhe Zaobao) comic strips have also been compiled into volumes. Ang Thiam Poh’s 又是这一班 (You Shi Zhe Yi Ban; It’s This Class Again) is a six-volume series about school life.6 Chua Sin Yew’s 新鲜阿婆 (Xin Xian A Po; What’s New With Grandma?) is set in the local neighbourhood and looks at Singapore through the eyes of its geriatric protagonist, an incurable optimist.7

笑看城市人 (Xiao Kan Cheng Shi Ren; Looking at City Folks) by Wu Yu (whose real name is Goh Ting Cheng) is a collection of the best 500 strips from the series 朝九晚五 (Zhao Jiu Wan Wu; Nine to Five) in Lianhe Zaobao. Wu’s comic strips focus on the daily struggles of white-collar workers. Meanwhile, 新加坡啦 (Xin Jia Po La; Singapore Lah) by Goh Kar Hoe (Wu Jiahe) comments on the headlines of the day.

In Singapore, veteran comic artists have readily taken newbies under their wings. Wee Tian Beng, the creator of the Celestial Zone comic series, has mentored several artists such as Yeo Hui Shan for the Dream Walker series (2009–18), Clio Hui Kiri for A Deal with Lucifer (2015–17) and Shen Jiahui for The Makeup Toolbox (2018–19). In 2018, Johnny Lau, one of the creators of Mr Kiasu, worked with artist Rick Chen on the creation of a comic series titled SupeRich. The second volume of this comic book was published in 2020.8

There have also been efforts to raise the profile of Singaporean comic artists by promoting their works through platforms like Comix.sg, an online directory and archive of comic creators born and/or based in Singapore and their works. This directory was launched in April 2020. 

In the following sections, we look at some major comic genres and introduce interesting comics available in the National Library’s collections.

<div style="background-colour:#fff6ba; padding:20px; margin: 20px; background: #fff6ba"><b>COMIC ANTHOLOGIES</b><br><br> Anthologies are a popular format for comics. A number of collections have been published over the years and these have helped to bring many artists to prominence.<br><br>
<b>PAST...</b><br><br>
	漫画同盟 (Comics Alliance) – a four-volume anthology series published in 1997, 1998 and 2001 – is a compilation of Chinese comics by various Singaporean comic artists. The books are edited by comic veterans Wee Tian Beng and Wee See Heng.<br><br>
The Liquid City anthology, the brainchild of Sonny Liew, brought together a star-studded cast of artists who contributed short comics that have been compiled in three volumes. The series has received much attention, with volume two being nominated for Best Anthology Series at the 2011 Eisner Awards. Many of the participating artists went on to produce their own comic books. Otto Fong, a contributor to the anthology, said: “The experience of being in an anthology and working alongside other comics artists spurred my competitiveness.”9<br><br>
	<img src="" style="width: 100px; height: 100px;" />Volume two of the  <i>Liquid City </i> anthology was nominated for Best Anthology Series at the 2011 Eisner Awards.  <i>Image reproduced from Sonny Liew and Lim Cheng Tju, eds., Liquid City Volume Two (Berkeley, California: Image Comics, [2010]).

<b>PRESENT...</b><br><br>
	In 2015, when Singapore celebrated 50 years of independence, a comics publication titled Our Months Together, comprising 12 stories representing the 12 months in a year, was published. That same year also saw the publication of Mr Kiasu in Singapore History, which brought the titular character back to different periods in Singapore’s history.<br><br>
In 2020, the Difference Engine – an independent comics publisher based in Singapore – released its first anthology titled Sound: A Comics Anthology. The publication is a showcase of 13 comics by writers and illustrators from across Southeast Asia in response to sound.</div>

<div style="background-colour:#fff6ba; padding:20px; margin: 20px; background: #fff6ba"><b>SUPERHEROES</b><br><br>Mention comics and most people automatically associate it with characters such as Superman and Wonder Woman. Superman popularised the superhero genre and inspired others to create their own superheroes, including in Singapore.<br><br><b>PAST...</b><br><br>One of the earliest local comic book superheroes is Pluto-man, who swooped onto the scene in 1983. He is the eponymous hero in The Valiant Pluto-man of Singapore by Roger Wong. Aliens from the planet Pluto transform an ordinary man named Po Shan into Pluto-man by shooting plutonic electrons into his body. They instruct him to “use [his] might and power to fight crime, and help those in need”. The aliens also give Po Shan a ring that aids in his transformation and which also doubles up as a weapon that can emit freeze rays.<br><br>
With his newfound powers – super strength, super speed, flight and a “plutonic instinct” for fighting crime – Pluto-man goes on a crime-busting spree, including foiling a bank heist involving a fake Merlion.<br><br>	<img src="" style="width: 100px; height: 100px;" />Pluto-man is endowed with super strength, super speed, flight and a “plutonic instinct” for fighting crime. <i>Image reproduced from Roger Wong, The Valiant Pluto-man of Singapore (Singapore: Fantasy Comics, 1983).

In 1985, the Singapore Police Force unveiled Captain V as the mascot for the National Crime Prevention Council. Captain V’s mission was to explain crime prevention to children and their role in the fight against crime.10 At the launch, a 3.65-metre-tall model of Captain V stood atop a bus, which crashed through a paper wall at the Police Academy on Thomson Road to reveal Captain V himself.11<br><br>
In 1987, Captain V was given his own comic book series when the first issue of The Amazing Adventures of Captain V was launched at Singapore’s second comics convention (Comicon ’87). Although Captain V combats crime using technology such as jet boots, he does not possess any inherent superpowers but has qualities such as vigilance and valour.<br><br>As a sidenote, while not strictly a superhero comic, among the older comics in the National Library is Python Gang by Ronald Wild. Written in English, Chinese and Malay, the comic revolves around police investigations into a criminal syndicate called the Python Gang. While it was printed in Singapore, there are no details about the publisher or year of publication. However, we do know that the comic has been in the National Library’s Legal Deposit collection since 1963.<br><br><b>PRESENT…</b><br><br>The Dim Sum Warriors (点心侠; Dian Xin Xia) series is the creation of husband-and-wife duo Colin Goh and Woo Yen Yen, of the TalkingCock.com satirical website and the Coxford Singlish Dictionary fame.12 The series features a colourful cast of familiar dim sum such as cha shao bao (roast pork bun), xia jiao (shrimp dumpling) and shao mai (pork and shrimp dumpling), imagined as kungfu warriors. The idea was conceived out of the couple’s love for dim sum and kungfu movies.
<br><br>The bilingual comic book was first  published in 2012 and later adapted into a musical that toured major Chinese cities.13 In 2019, the couple launched a spin-off storybook series for children as well as an educational app for children to learn Mandarin.14
<br><br>Special mention should also be made of Sacred Guardians (2020) by Adyeel Djoeharie and illustrated by Alan Bay. Supported by the National Arts Council, this comic book is a prequel story to “Sacred Guardian Singa: A Singapore Superhero Project”. Sacred Guardian Singa is a “Tokusatsu superhero character rooted in the real culture, history and heritage of Singapore and Southeast Asia”.15 (Tokusatsu is a Japanese term for live-action film or television drama that makes heavy use of special effects.)
<br><br>Set in the 7th century on the island of Tumasik (Temasek), the story follows the quest of the immortal scribe Dev who gathers a group of “sacred guardians” with special powers to fight an invasion by the evil demon king. In June 2021, Sacred Guardians became the first local comic book to be made into an audio drama.</div>

<div style="background-colour:#fff6ba; padding:20px; margin: 20px; background: #fff6ba"><b>INFORMATIONAL/EDUCATIONAL</b><br><br>Various organisations, companies and government agencies in Singapore have used comics as a medium to convey important information and messages in an effective yet highly entertaining manner.<br><br>One of the best examples is the poster on toilet etiquette found in public toilets across Singapore. Rendered in a comic strip format, these posters are a collaboration between the National Environment Agency and the cartoonist Lee Chee Chew as part of the Clean & Green Singapore campaign.16<br><br>Another example of an educational comic is Otto Fong’s popular “Sir Fong’s Adventures in Science” comic series that impart scientific concepts in a fun and accessible way. Fong drew on his many years of experience as a secondary school science teacher for his comic series featuring a teacher who is a monkey and his student-rabbits.<br><br><b>PAST...</b><br><br>Published by the Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association in 1979, What If They Call Me Chicken? is a cautionary tale about the dangers of taking drugs. A schoolboy named Kok Meng is offered a cigarette laced with drugs. While his friends agree to try it, he turns it down and goes home and tells his parents what had happened. Kok Meng is called a “chicken” for saying no to drugs, but he is vindicated in the end as his friends are arrested and punished. The message is blunt and direct: taking drugs is wrong and will ruin your life.<br><br>	<img src="" style="width: 100px; height: 100px;" />This comic book  is a cautionary tale about the dangers of taking drugs published by the Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association in 1979. <i>Image reproduced from Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association, What If They Call Me Chicken? (Singapore: Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association, [1979]). (From PublicationSG).</i><br><br><b>PRESENT…</b><br><br>Graphic medicine is a genre in which comics are used as a medium for communicating about medicine and healthcare.17 Examples of local comics in this category include All That Remains (2018) and All Death Matters (2020) about dementia, and end-of-life and palliative care respectively. Created by James Tan and funded by the Lien Foundation, the two comics aim to initiate “die-logues” about taboo topics such as death and illness and to start thinking about palliative care planning.<br><br>In The Antibiotic Tales (2019), Sonny Liew partnered infectious diseases physician Hsu Li Yang to create a cautionary tale of an apocalyptic future because of a general resistance to antibiotics.<br><br>	<img src="" style="width: 100px; height: 100px;" />This graphic novel deals with dementia. <i>Image reproduced from James Tan, All That Remains (Singapore: Lien Foundation: Alzheimer’s Disease Association, Singapore, 2018).

<div style="background-colour:#fff6ba; padding:20px; margin: 20px; background: #fff6ba"><b>MYTHS AND LEGENDS</b><br><br>Publisher Asiapac Books produces English comic titles on Chinese classics like the story of Mulan to get the younger generation interested in Chinese culture and literature.
<br><br>There are also locally published comics inspired by local legends. In the Chinese comic, 女侠红头巾: 大战油鬼仔 (The Samsui Sword; 2021), the protagonist takes on the orang minyak, or oily man, a supernatural creature from Malay folklore who is coated in black oil and preys on young women. And in The Secret of Redhill (2015), a group of students go back in time to relive the legend of Bukit Merah.<br><br><b>PAST...</b><br><br>Published in 1949, Tani of the Tigers is an adventure comic and a Malayan spin on legends like The Jungle Book and Tarzan.18 It tells the story of Tani, an orphaned child raised by tigers in the Pahang jungle of Malaya and who is able to converse with animals. An advertisement in the Malaya Tribune described it as being “drawn, written & published by Malayans” and that it “[excelled] any American comics published overseas!”19 <br><br>	<img src="" style="width: 100px; height: 100px;" />This Malayan tale tells the story of Tani, an orphaned child raised by tigers in the Pahang jungle of Malaya and who is able to converse with animals. </i>Image reproduced from Willie and Bio, Tani of the Tigers (Singapore: Keng Yan Leng, [19--]).

The comics were produced in Jawi and included Malay folktales and contemporary tales in Malay society.<br><br>Nora Abdullah, also known as Nek Norzarah Abdullah, was Geliga’s first female cartoonist and also the first known Malay female cartoonist in Singapore and Malaya.20 Born in Kelantan, Nora Abdullah was only 15 years old when she published her first comic book with Geliga in 1955, titled Cik Siti Wan Kembang.21 Siti Wan Kembang is the legendary queen who ruled Kelantan in the 17th century. She was renowned for her wisdom and mystical powers, and rode to battle on horseback armed with a sword and accompanied by an army of female warriors.<br><br>	<img src="" style="width: 100px; height: 100px;" />(Left) Nora Abdullah, also known as Nek Norzarah Abdullah, was Geliga’s first female cartoonist and also the first known Malay female cartoonist in Singapore and Malaya. <i>Courtesy of the Malay Heritage Centre.</i> (Right) An Indonesian folktale about a gentle and obedient village girl living with her evil stepsister and stepmother. <i>Image reproduced from Nora Abdullah, Bawang Puteh Bawang Merah (Singapura: Geliga, 1957).

</i><br><br>Between 1955 and 1961, Nora Abdullah published at least 12 comic books with Geliga, including Bawang Puteh Bawang Merah (1957), which is based on an Indonesian folktale about a gentle and obedient village girl living with her evil stepsister and stepmother. The village girl eventually marries a prince.<br><br><b>PRESENT...</b><br><br>The Comics of Singapore Histories (COSH Studios) – a collective of artists and writers – has produced seven graphic novels on local history between 2017 and 2018, with funding from the National Heritage Board. These comics offer stories relating to Singapore history and heritage but with a speculative twist. From supernatural encounters in Bukit Brown Cemetery (Final Resting Place) to cooking chicken rice in a zombie apocalypse (We’ll Eat When We’re Done), COSH comics present Singapore stories in a creative and fun way, reinterpreting familiar situations in new and witty ways.</div>
