#### The Y.W.C.A. Cookery Book of Malaya is a treatise on the changing culinary styles as well as evolving domestic practices and eating habits of Singaporeans over three decades.




First published in 1932, the Y.W.C.A. Cookery Book of Malaya has been updated and republished nine times — the last in 1962. More than an ordinary record of recipes, this influential cookbook is a treatise on the changing culinary styles as well as evolving domestic practices and eating habits of Singaporeans over three decades.
