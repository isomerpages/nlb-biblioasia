S. Rajaratnam – one of Singapore’s founding fathers and its first and longest-serving foreign minister – was a man of ideas, ideals and action. This second volume of his biography covers the period from Singapore’s merger with Malaya to form Malaysia in 1963 to his death in 2006. Rajaratnam fought for more than a decade for Singapore’s independence, and to build a non-communal and meritocratic Singapore. As foreign minister, he transformed Singapore’s relations with its neighbours and co-founded ASEAN. As labour minister, he laid the foundation for Singapore’s unique model of tripartism between unions, employers and the government. One of Rajaratnam’s enduring legacies is the national pledge that he drafted in 1966, affirming his belief in a multiracial Singapore regardless of race, language or religion.
