#### Media and entertainment websites were used as an empirical resource for the investigation and understanding of the definition of Chinese youths in Singapore. An understanding of “youth cultural identity” is fundamental in analysing their response to global cultural influences: it would resonate with their consumption of information from the web medium.

     Studies demonstrate that traditional mainstream<br>     media such as newspapers, television and radio<br>     play a key role in the management of cultural <br>     inter-ethnic relations in Singapore (Kuo, 1999).<br>     Design strategies for cultual web communications<br>     are a new way to express the formation and<br>     representation of new national and cultural<br>     identities in contemporary Chinese communities.<br>     Internet culture has influenced lifestyle and<br>     cultural identity of youths in the global economy.<br>     Recent surveys in Singapore have also shown that<br>     connectivity (via electronic means) is among their<br>     top Five'C's1 in the their social priorities (Yen, 2005).

In this study, media and entertainment websites are used as an empirical resource for the investigation and understanding of the definition of Chinese youths in Singapore. An understanding of ‘youth cultural identity’ is fundamental in analysing their response to global cultural influences: it would resonate with their consumption of information from the web medium. Media and entertainment websites are integral because this industry forms a key aspect of popular culture in Singapore. Moreover, there is an increasing trend to incorporate pop culture consumption in national policies. For instance, Chinese pop singers, pop idols and television celebrities have become media network spokespersons for the promotion of the official Chinese language in the state-initiated ‘Speak Mandarin’ Campaign.2 

This research contributes to the theoretical discussion on the notion of a potential ‘East Asian Identity’ among the Chinese youth group. ‘East Asian Identity’ is constructed on the basis of the criss-crossing consumption of popular cultural products (pop music, movies, fashion and food) across geographical boundaries in the region (Chua, 2004). The analysis is also examined with reference to the local cultural environment (Singapore) in the context of the growing economy in China.

Based on a cultural analytical model, this study will examine how cultural characteristics are manifested through various Singapore media and entertainment websites while focusing on key components of visual interface designs such as colour, metaphor and information architecture. These components shall be studied in relation to their socio-cultural environment. Visual languages will be chosen for the analysis as these design components have increasingly played a primary role for members of the younger generation especially in verbal expressions and its respective comparisons. As observed by Frutiger, the influx of pictorial information and moving visuals such as computer games, manga, Music Television Video (MTV) have encapsulated the ‘idea’ in visual form, directing the eye to the human mind. The ‘stylising’ of pictures and signs has become an alternative process of reading printed text (Frutiger, 1989). This analysis demonstrates that different design approaches implemented by the media and entertainment corporations yield different visual responses, leading to the varied manifestations of Singapore cultural identity, and its impact on the changing trends of regional and global development.

#### **Conceptualising Singapore Cultural Identity and the Internet: Singapore Chinese Youth**

The Internet provides a new channel in the formation of national and cultural identities for Chinese communities. In the midst of globalisation and with China now an economic superpower, the learning of the Chinese language in Singapore has been continuously reinforced in the recent years. This includes an increasing number of online virtual communities that aim to foster community building and Chinese language learning, in bilingual (Mandarin and English language) sites such as OMY3 (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/6133538603/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/6133538603</a><a>) and STOMP (Straits Times Online Mobile Print - </a><a href="https://stomp.straitstimes.com/">https://stomp.straitstimes.com/</a><a>). Both of these news and interactive web portals provide young users with an interactive platform to share their views and opinions online and also through new media channels such as SMS, MMS, vodcast and podcast.
