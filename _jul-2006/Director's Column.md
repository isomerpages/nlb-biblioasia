In recent years, the Singapore government has launched various initiatives to strengthen Singaporean’s rootedness and sense of identity, for a stronger nation. With the Singapore 21 vision and the Remaking Singapore Committee, the government seeks to create in Singaporeans a sense of belonging and to make Singapore a place where we can call home. One of the strategic thrusts of these initiatives is the importance of knowing our heritage. The call to preserve and build shared memories and all things Singaporean feature strongly in these moves to shape national identity. The emphasis on National Education in and beyond schools is aimed at establishing a collective consciousness in Singaporeans. Singapore’s journey to nationhood and the founding generation’s dreams, struggles and success are major learning points in National Education.

In line with this, the National Library has organised campaigns and programmes to support these initiatives. The FIND IT campaign, launched in April 2006 at the National Library, embraces heritage as a theme. FIND Heritage sought to contribute to the sense of identity and rootedness of Singaporeans by helping library users to be more aware of our heritage through the Library’s collections. The campaign aimed to introduce the rich plethora of heritage resources available in the Singapore and Southeast Asian collections, as well as the reference and information services provided by the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library. Participants who attended talks during the campaign found them to be comprehensive and insightful.

In July, the National Library embarks on another learning journey on heritage. With a range of talks, panel discussions, public forums and documentary screenings that focus on the discovery and understanding of our heritage, we would like to encourage you and your family and friends to sign up for them at <a href="https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/home">https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/home</a>.

In conjunction with National Day, the Library also plays host to a special exhibition, *Singapore Honour*s, from July to the end of August. Paying tribute to some of Singapore’s most distinguished citizens, the exhibition will showcase medals awarded to Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew, Lt Gen (Retd.) Winston Choo, and Ms Elizabeth Choy, Singapore’s only war heroine. Dr Alexandre Chao and Mr Heng Yeow Pheow, who both lost their lives while saving others, are also remembered.

9 August 2006 marks the 41st year of independence of Singapore. As we celebrate this momentous day, let us not forget how our heritage shaped our past and continues to influence our lives in the future. Please enjoy the articles featuring our short but rich history in this issue of BiblioAsia. 

We look forward to seeing you at the Library and happy reading!
