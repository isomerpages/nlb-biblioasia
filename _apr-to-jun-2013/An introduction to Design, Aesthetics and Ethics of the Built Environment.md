#### The built environment is a space that reflects the dialogue among private, public and political spheres. Design impacts our lives everyday and good design can transform a mere place to one imbued with life and meaning.



The built environment forms the backbone of any society; it is the backdrop of our lives, whether we realise it or not. As such the design of the built environment is paramount to our well-being, to our ability to connect, to interact, to evolve
individually and collectively.


The built environment is a space in constant tension between public, private and political interests; as such any intervention within this forms an ethical judgement. Any decision made within the built environment will have an effect on one group over another: for example, building a road over culturally sensitive land favours the extraction of economic gains over cultural sensitivity to a group. This decision is more than
a simple cost-benefit analysis; it also has a multitude of ethical considerations to it.

For anyone concerned with designing within the built environment, cultivating the ability to recognise, listen and respond to what people undergo and feel is vital. We relate to our environments emotionally, and we often fail to appreciate the complexity and variance of the human experience.

Good design within the built environment is mindful of the various tensions within spaces and acknowledges the importance for the population to feel connected to a place. Social, economic, cultural and political considerations will be present in all interventions within the built environment, thus one must have a good grounding in what design is and its importance in unlocking its potential for positive action.
