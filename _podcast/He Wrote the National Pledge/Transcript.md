---
<p><strong>Irene</strong> 
<br>When he became foreign minister in ’65, he was actually in Malaysia. And
so when he arrived at the airport, the questions were being fired by the
reporter. What is Singapore’s foreign policy? He had to literally make
it up on the fly. He was unbriefed. He didn’t even have a chance to meet
the Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew yet. He had no discussion with his cabinet
colleagues about what should be Singapore’s foreign policy. He formed it
right from the get-go.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>On the fly, as it were.</p>
<p><strong>Irene</strong> 
<br>Literally, literally. When he came back to Singapore, his office, there’s
just one secretary, there’s one desk, and that’s him. And that’s basically
the MFA. And it took some time before he got a permanent secretary. So
when you say he’s a longest-serving foreign minister, that’s correct, but
as a founding foreign minister, that gives him not only the platform to
shape it from nothing, but also to give it its life and its spirit and
its substance, which I think served Singapore well.</p>

<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>You’re listening to BiblioAsia+, a podcast produced by the National Library
of Singapore. At <em>BiblioAsia</em>, we tell stories about Singapore’s
past, some familiar, others forgotten, all fascinating.</p>
<p>The National Pledge that generations of school kids recite every morning
– that’s because of Rajaratnam. Singapore’s entry into the United Nations
– that’s Rajaratnam too. Singapore’s longest serving foreign minister –
that too is Rajaratnam. A journalist turned politician turned diplomat,
S. Rajaratnam wore many hats in the service of Singapore. His contribution
to Singapore is so great that to cover this man’s life adequately required
20 years of research and writing and over 1,200 pages of gripping prose.</p>
<p>My name is Jimmy Yap, and I’m the Editor in Chief of <em>BiblioAsia</em>,
a publication of the National Library of Singapore. With me in the studio
is Irene Ng, herself a former journalist turned politician turned biographer.
The second volume of a biography of one of Singapore’s founding fathers
has recently been published, and it’s a great read that manages to capture
the drama of the times. Irene, thank you for coming on the show, and congratulations
on the great launch.</p>
<p><strong>Irene</strong> 
<br>Thank you, Jimmy. It’s great to be here.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br><em><a href="https://catalogue.nlb.gov.sg/search/card?recordId=300059306" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">The Lion’s Roar</a></em> is
a remarkable work. It’s over 700 pages, about one of the founding fathers
of modern Singapore. This volume, which is the second volume of two, covers
Rajaratnam’s life from 1963 onwards. Obviously, a very significant period
in Singapore’s history. But before we talk about this very important book,
can you tell us about Rajaratnam? Maybe your first meeting with him. When
was that and what was he like?</p>
<p><strong>Irene</strong> 
<br>I was formerly a newspaper journalist, and I had known Mr Rajaratnam since
the late 1980s, when I was covering local and regional politics. He was
always very generous and helpful. I asked him for quotes, rung him up at
night at home. And he’s a great source of background information as well.
Because he, being a former journalist, knew how difficult it is sometimes
for us to make sure that our reports are accurate, capture the nuances,
and he was very prepared to go off-record for background information, so
he’s a great source, as well as a great mentor.</p>
<p>I look to him for inspiration. As a journalist, he had excelled in his
field, and yet he has never bragged about his days as a journalist. Whenever
I meet him, he never says, “Oh, I did this when I was a journalist. I was
an award-winning short writer.” Never found out about those until I began
researching him. You ask my impressions of him, I found him modest, reticent,
reserved. He’s only very animated when he talks about his ideas and ideals
for Singapore. I think he saw in me a young mind, that needs to be shaped
or inspired, so that I understand the vulnerabilities of Singapore and
what made him fight so hard for these ideals and hoping that the younger
generation can similarly be inspired. So that’s my impression of him.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>It was interesting to me that you connected and part of it was that he
knew how hard it was to be a journalist.</p>
<p><strong>Irene</strong> 
<br>You’re right, Jimmy. And also, he wants to make sure that journalists
can do a good job. All through his life, when he was a culture minister,
he had dealt with newspapers and editors, and his concern always was the
standard of journalism in Singapore. And he always believed that the key
to maintaining excellence in Singapore journalism is to encourage good
journalists to pursue their passion, and to facilitate their interest in
bringing insightful news to the wider audience. So when I was in <em>The</em>  <em>New Paper</em>,
he understood that my job was to make important news digestible to the
young reader. So I remember once I wanted to interview him about ASEAN
and also about the [Prime Minister] transition to Goh Chok Tong. And I
turned up in his office and what happened was the night before, I used
to cycle to work. I cycled from East Coast to Times House in Kim Sing Road
in those days.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Oh my goodness, that’s a long ride.</p>
<p><strong>Irene</strong> 
<br>It’s a long ride. And the night before, I had an accident. A taxi hit
my back wheel, and I flew across the road. So I had grazes on my nose,
my chin, and I had a swollen lip. I decided I’m still going to go for the
interview the next day, because I don’t want to postpone it. It’s important
that he made the time for me. So I turned up in his office with swollen
lips and with grazed cheeks and a cut over my nose and his eyes widened.
But the perfect gentleman didn’t make me feel uncomfortable, made me feel
perfectly at ease and just carried on with the interview as if there was
nothing untoward at all with my appearance. So I was very impressed by
his graciousness and his ability to put people at ease. A great diplomat.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Actually my next question is actually regarding the interactions you’ve
had with him. This is one of those interesting anecdotes that you have.
Are there any other interesting anecdotes that give us a flavor of the
man?</p>
<p><strong>Irene</strong> 
<br>Well, once we had dinner in a restaurant, and I was surprised that he
accepted. You know, he’s just truly a gracious man. He has no sense of
“I’m the minister, and therefore you have to treat me with great awe and
respect.” I thought that he’ll be waiting for me in the restaurant. But
he thought I would be waiting for him in the bar. So there was a miscommunication.
So when we arrived, I couldn’t find him, and I saw him later, about 20
minutes later. But he was just waiting patiently, and there was no fuss,
[he] didn’t say, “Why are you late? I have to hurry and go off now, and
how dare you keep me waiting?” I explained the situation, and no problem,
we just sat down, have a nice dinner. And of course, throughout the dinner,
he talked about Greek philosophers, talked about how in the days of Socrates,
people sat around the table and talked about important things, meaningful
ideas, and not talk about food and what sort of drink they drink.</p>
<p>I was very impressed because you think that somebody of his stature would
see such little inconveniences like keeping him waiting for 20 minutes
as an insult, but that’s Rajaratnam, that’s the man. And he’s just being
himself. So if he had a chance to talk to you about ideas, he would just
go into his own world and there he will be flowing like a stream full of
beautiful insights that stay with me for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>That’s it sounds like, I wish I had the opportunity to have at least a
coffee, although I would try not to keep him waiting.</p>
<p><strong>Irene</strong> 
<br>I wouldn’t want to do that again if I could.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Let’s talk a little bit about the book that you’ve just launched, <em>The Lion’s Roar</em>.</p>
<p>It’s the second volume of a two-volume biography on Rajaratnam, but tell
us about it. All we’ve mentioned so far in the podcast is that it deals
with his life from 1963. But how is the book structured and what are some
of its main themes?</p>
<p><strong>Irene</strong> 
<br>Well, because this book is from 1963 until his death in 2006, the first
eight chapters deal with the Malaysia years. And I devoted that amount
of space to the Malaysia years, because I thought it really defined the
passion and conviction that he had for the vision of a non-communal nation,
one that is free, independent. and fair and just, and that gives equal
opportunities to people regardless of their race, language, or religion.</p>
<p>And the fight that he mounted, the audacious campaign for a Malaysian
Malaysia, I thought, captured that aspect of him that many people may not
appreciate, especially since I have access to archival documents where
he drafted the manifesto, where there were notes of meetings of his organisation,
of the first gathering of the opposition leaders in Malaya for this Malaysia
Malaysian campaign. Eight chapters, and after that, there are quite a few
chapters on MFA [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] as well as his labour years.
But if you ask me what the great themes are, it has to do with his belief
in the power of the human will. That’s the great theme, but allied to it
is the power of his ideas and the power of his transformative leadership,
because you can have ideas, but if you don’t have the conviction and the
drive and the ability to turn those ideas into reality, then it’s just
nice ideas.</p>
<p>Similarly, you might have the human will, but if you don’t have the vehicle,
if you don’t have the ingenuity and the guts to create a vehicle, in this
case, a political vehicle, to drive forward your ideas and make sure that
it brings the support of the people, then it’s just will, isn’t it? A lot
of us can say that, “Oh, I have the will to do this,” but whether you can
achieve it or not is also another issue. But in him, you can see all these
factors in play. And so to me, it’s a very human story that has a relevance
to all of us, regardless of our walk of life. You don’t have to be a politician.
You don’t have to be a statesman to appreciate this book, because I think
there are lessons in it for every one of us.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Your two volumes represent 20 years of hard work, and they come up to
over 1,200 pages. Why should a young Singaporean today want to read about
Rajaratnam? Why does he deserve this level of attention?</p>
<p><strong>Irene</strong> 
<br>The power of his ideas continue to be relevant today, as well as the power
of his vision. Let’s take 21 July 1964. That’s the race riots in Singapore.
At that time, Rajaratnam, he was the point man dealing with the federation
leaders on the race riots. And there was a chance that the PAP [People’s
Action Party] could be arrested because of the instigation by the Malay
Ultras against the PAP leadership.</p>
<p>So Lee Kuan Yew was under great stress with death threats on his life.
And Rajaratnam was doing his level best to counter the pernicious rumours
spread by the Malay Ultras, whom he and his colleagues have suspected were
instigating the riots. And despite their best efforts, a second riot broke
out in September.</p>
<p>And can you imagine, for someone in the middle of that, where your whole
life is to build a non-communal nation, one that’s united and just, and
to see this happening all around you, it’s literally like your whole world
is crumbling around you. So he himself said, he thought that, during the
riots, I thought that it would all collapse, it meaning his vision of a
non-communal nation.</p>
<p>Yet, he persevered. He hatched this strategy of an audacious Malaysian
Malaysia campaign. That is, he’s going to bring the message of a non-communal
nation to the entire Malaysia, get the support of the people, and so that
he can make this vision become reality, and the Malay Ultras will see that
this vision has merit, that it’s valid, that it will work.</p>
<p>Devastating moment that he had was when Lee Kuan Yew came to him on the
7 August 1965 and said, “We have to separate. Tunku says, if we don’t,
there’ll be race riots, there’ll be a bloodbath, and we don’t want to take
the responsibility for that.” So Raja was basically the last man standing
when it came to signing the separation agreement.</p>
<p>So when he did, it was a traumatic moment for him because it signifies
defeat. And it was shameful because he let down everyone who believed in
him, all his allies who joined him in this Malaysian Malaysia campaign.
Yet, from that moment of great torment, he could still rise and come up
with the National Pledge.</p>
<p>If you can just visualise that, a man who’s really at the bottom of the
pit when it comes to his dreams, when it comes to his vision, when it comes
to what he’s been fighting for, and picking himself up and finding that
strength and the inner conviction to write the National Pledge that would
capture exactly the vision that he had been fighting for all along, but
he had seen crushed in Malaysia to fight for a non-communal nation regardless
of race, language or religion.</p>
<p>And I think that the triumph of the human will, the rise of the human
spirit out of the sense of great defeat, is something that all of us, I
think, can identify with in our lives. May not be in the same scale, we
don’t have the responsibility of the lives of 2 million people at that
time in Singapore. We don’t have the responsibility of 10 million people
at that time in the whole of Malaysia.</p>
<p>But in our own lives, I think we are faced in our setbacks. But how do
you still hold on to your ideals because you believe in it so much and
continue to press on despite all the things that has been thrown at you
to keep you down? I think that’s a great example of one lesson that’s useful
for all of us.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>I was actually very impressed reading your account about how Lee Kuan
Yew did his level best to make sure that when he had to persuade Rajaratnam,
Rajaratnam would not attempt to sway the other PAP members into rejecting
the proposal by Tunku.</p>
<p>I think you captured that moment very well. The sense at that point of
how his dreams were all, you know, crushed and initially he refused to
sign the document.</p>
<p><strong>Irene</strong> 
<br>That’s right. Twice he refused. And then poor Lee Kuan Yew has to go and
see the Tunku twice.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Right? He has to go and see the Tunku and ask the Tunku to talk to Rajaratnam.
I thought that was amazing. When you talk about the pledge, these are ideals
for Singapore, but they’re very much his own ideals, aren’t they?</p>
<p><strong>Irene</strong> 
<br>That’s right. He’s a man who entered politics with a firm set of convictions.
Unlike some modern-day politicians in other parts of the world who enter
politics just to ride on the populist tide. They just put a finger in the
air and say, okay, how do I get into power? And then they just go with
the issues.</p>
<p>But not Rajaratnam and his generation of leaders. They came into politics
to achieve a better society, and in his mind what is that better society
is this vision of a non-communal nation just and fair, regardless of race,
of language and religion. So they came in with that vision and so how do
you achieve that, and that was his lifelong mission.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>It definitely comes across. Now, your books are obviously much more detailed
than anything that has ever been written about Rajaratnam for obvious reasons.
Did you find during your research anything that was, that surprised you?
Or that you think would surprise the ordinary Singaporean?</p>
<p><strong>Irene</strong> 
<br>Most people are familiar with the battle-hardened politician that Rajaratnam
was because he’s very quick on the uptake when it comes to addressing critics,
very ferocious in his writings, attacking ideas that he thought were dangerous
for Singapore. So he has a reputation for being quite good with a knuckle
duster when it comes to what he thinks are groups, and interests that may
harm Singapore.</p>
<p>But there’s also a very endearing and soft side to him that I discovered
when I wrote the book. For instance, I didn’t realise that he was an animal
lover. He would pick up stray cats, and there would always be a stray cat
or two in his house. And he loves dogs as well. So there would be a German
Shepherd [and] at one point, Silky Terrier.</p>
<p>His later life, he doted on pugs. And the cats and dogs live happily in
his house. At that time in the ’70s, it was not a very usual thing for
people with animals to bring their animals to vets. So this local vet is
having trouble getting funding, getting space to set up an animal hospital.
But he turned to Raja, and Raja gave him his full support. So when the
animal hospital was set up in Whitley Road in 1985, Rajaratnam opened it.
So this was an aspect of him that very few people know about.</p>
<p>Another aspect is of course his great love for his wife, Piroska Feher.
She’s a Hungarian he met in London during the war in the late 1930s. She
was a Lutheran, so when he married her, it was without the parents knowing
it, because the family is a very strict Jaffna Tamil caste, very caste
conscious as well. And Raja knew that the parents would not agree, but
so he married her in secret in London during the war and just brought her
home after the war and the family didn’t accept her for some time.</p>
<p>But the love that he had for his wife was very deep, and he always liked
to say that they are very different in temperament because he’s reserved
and contemplative. He loves books. The wife loves gardening, loves classical
music, a bit more gregarious, outspoken but they got along very well. So
Dennis Bloodworth – this is one of the couple’s good friends, a foreign
journalist – says that they complement each other, and there’s no doubt
about the great love between them.</p>
<p>And you can see that in the many episodes of his life where she tries
to protect him wherever she can from working too hard, although that sometimes
doesn’t work. So when he got a heart attack in London, she was really beside
herself because everybody was thinking, including the state, was preparing
for a state funeral. But he made it through, and he ended up to be the
one who outlived his wife.</p>
<p>And I think if you read the last few chapters of my book, you’ll find
a very different Raja. The Raja without the Piroska is, I would say, a
man who has lost the colour in his life. I think that would be a very human
aspect of him that many of us will not appreciate until you read the book.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>I definitely, you know, was very moved when I read the last few chapters
after she had passed on. And, it got a bit dusty when I was reading that
and I choked up a bit.</p>
<p>So, Irene, I think, you know, what a lot of listeners would like to know
is how did Lee Kuan Yew view Rajaratnam? What was their relationship like?
You know, was it cordial?</p>
<p><strong>Irene</strong> 
<br>Their relationship went back a long way, right till 1952, that’s when
they first met. At the time, Mr Rajaratnam was a famous newspaper columnist
with the <em>Singapore Standard</em>. And his writings would garner great
support from the public because he writes, number one, so well and so impactful,
anti-colonial tirades and very powerful ones.</p>
<p>So, people take notice of him. So Mr Lee Kuan Yew heard of this fellow
called Mr Rajaratnam and asked to meet him. So Dr Goh Keng Swee, who knew
Mr Rajaratnam, introduced them. And at that time, Mr Lee was relatively
unknown compared to Mr Rajaratnam, who was the famous one. And Mr Lee wanted
Mr Rajaratnam’s help, he wanted Rajaratnam to help him in his postal strike
campaign. At the time, Mr Lee Kuan Yew was representing the Postal and
Telecommunications Uniform Staff Union. And negotiations with the chief
secretary had failed, and the postmen decided to strike. And Mr Lee knew
that the other newspapers like <em>The Straits Times</em> would just ignore
him.</p>
<p>Mr Lee was in fact trying to build up mass support through the unions
by gaining victories in strikes with selected groups that were anti-colonial
in their temperament and in their issues. So Rajaratnam being anti-colonial
and always looking for a good cause to back, decided to do that and help
Mr Lee, and Mr Lee won the postal strike. I would say largely because of
Mr Rajaratnam’s support, which gave him so much publicity and roused up
the people to be up in arms against the colonial powers. So that’s where
the relationship started. And since then, Mr Lee relied on Mr Rajaratnam
for his masterful communication skills, as well as for his strategic ideas
on how to approach political issues and how to present them and project
them to the public.</p>
<p>And from there he became the core of the PAP leaders who met in Oxley
Road at the basement of Mr Lee’s house. And the rest is history. But see
they started out as not equals. I would say Mr Rajaratnam was more powerful
and more famous. There was no doubt that he was the more charismatic man,
and he was a more powerful speaker able to rouse up the crowds in speeches.</p>
<p>So Mr Lee also is known for his strategic way of thinking through issues
and policies. So Mr Lee was a leader of the group, but they are a relationship
of equals. So he was first among equals from the beginning. Over the years
when they had to go up against the pro-communists and the communists and
later on the communalists, Mr Lee relied a lot on Mr Rajaratnam’s dauntless
spirit, and his sense of “We can beat this, Harry”, which is what he called
Mr Lee. We must not let them win. And he will find a way to counter the
narratives from the pro-communists or the communists. He’ll find a way
to mount a campaign that will put them on the back foot. So Mr Lee looked
to Mr Rajaratnam for ideas as well as for the encouragement.</p>
<p>So Mr Lee wrote once in my, in the foreword for my volume one, that he
[Rajaratnam] gave him the energy and the heart to carry on fighting. This
is why I called Rajaratnam the <em><a href="https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/redir/itemdetails?bid=300055076" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Singapore Lion</a></em>,
for the first volume. Gave him the heart to carry on fighting.</p>
<p>So later on when Mr Rajaratnam became the foreign minister, there was
the first cabinet of independent Singapore. Their relationship was still
one of equals, but of course with PM Lee in charge of foreign policy, as
well of all the policies, but foreign policies was very existential to
the country’s survival. And he left it to Mr Rajaratnam in the first three
months basically, because he [Lee] was holed up in Changi Cottage, at the
advice of the security police. So Mr Rajaratnam basically had to improvise
and start, start to pick up the threads of what would be the foreign policy
of Singapore. So when you look at the foundations of the relationship,
it was one of equals, but it depended on a lot of trust in each other.
That doesn’t mean that they have the same views on issues or policies.
In fact, they had quite robust debates behind closed doors. Even in the
cabinet memos, you can see how Mr Rajaratnam disagreed with some of his
policies. So it’s one of equals, I would say, and one of healthy respect.
But as Mr Lee said, Mr Rajaratnam would not concede just because he’s Prime
Minister. It shows mutual respect as well as the friendship that they’ve
had all these years.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>I like the fact that Mr Rajaratnam never backed down, right, with, with
Mr Lee. You know, he fought as much as he could for remaining in Malaysia,
and, there were always disagreements. But as you say, I think he didn’t
just agree to Mr Lee’s suggestions and then try and undermine him behind
his back. He was very, very honest and forthright in that.</p>
<p><strong>Irene</strong> 
<br>And he’s honourable in another sense as well. He believed in the concept
of collective responsibility. So once a decision is made by the cabinet,
even though he might not feel comfortable with it, he would go out and
defend it to the hilt, as if it was his decision as well.</p>
<p>No one would know of the disagreement behind doors. No one would know
of his reservations. Because he wanted to present an image of a united
government who was determined, filled with resolve, and could not be divided.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Rajaratnam is known for many things, but I think he’s probably best known
for being Singapore’s first and longest serving foreign minister. You know,
what do you think is his main legacy in Singapore’s foreign policy? And
I know it’s a hard question to answer because he was there for so long,
and he was there at a very critical moment when there was no MFA.</p>
<p><strong>Irene</strong> 
<br>When he became foreign minister in ’65, he was actually in Malaysia. And
so when he arrived at the airport, the questions were being fired by the
reporter. What is Singapore’s foreign policy? He had to literally make
it up on the fly. He was unbriefed. He didn’t even have a chance to meet
the Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew yet. He had no discussion with his cabinet
colleagues about what should be Singapore’s foreign policy. He formed it
right from the get-go.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>On the fly, as it were.</p>
<p><strong>Irene</strong> 
<br>Literally, literally. When he came back to Singapore, his office, there’s
just one secretary, there’s one desk, and that’s him. And that’s basically
the MFA. And it took some time before he got a permanent secretary. So
when you say he’s a longest-serving foreign minister, that’s correct, but
as a founding foreign minister, that gives him not only the platform to
shape it from nothing, but also to give it its life and its spirit and
its substance, which I think served Singapore well. I don’t think you can
think of a better founding foreign minister than Rajaratnam, because of
the qualities that he had.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>He didn’t have that much of a diplomatic experience. He did such a tremendous
job as Singapore’s foreign minister. What qualities do you think it is
that allowed him to be that?</p>
<p><strong>Irene</strong> 
<br>I would think there are several factors. One, of course, was his journalist
background. He used to write very serious geopolitical articles and columns,
and he reads widely, you know, for every article that he writes, including
every speech that he writes later, he would research deeply. So he has
this amazing reservoir of knowledge, but he also knows how to draw from
his extensive reading to think on the spot.</p>
<p>He has strategic thinking, and he has a way of also joining all the dots.
So as foreign minister, you’re required to be able to make sense of all
the complex factors that you see before you. He has that ability, partly
because he has been exercising his brain that way all his adult life before
he became foreign minister.</p>
<p>And I think another factor is his own personality. He is very quick on
the uptake. He is able to perform under stress, and in fact, Lee Kuan Yew
says that he performs best under stress. And he rises to the challenge
whenever a challenge is presented to him. That’s part of his package. He
has self-confidence, he’s resilient, he’s adaptable.</p>
<p>And that comes also from his life experience. He had such an eventful
life before he became foreign minister. His life in London, for instance,
when he was stranded there during the war, and it was that time he mixed
around with the Afro-Asian nationalists and it piqued his interest in international
politics.</p>
<p>So there he picked up all the nuances and all the latest ideas on nationalism.
It’s both his experience, his career as a journalist before, as well as
his own personality. I think all that came together to make a perfect package
for a founding foreign minister of Singapore.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>I take it for granted that, you know, Singapore’s in the UN [United Nations],
Singapore’s in ASEAN. And then I read that, you know, he had to work quite
hard, actually to get Singapore admitted into the UN.</p>
<p>And Singapore wasn’t initially meant to be in ASEAN. And I think that’s
one of the great things about the book is that it helps you look at things
that you take for granted and look at them with new eyes. And that I really
appreciated that. You know, he was Singapore’s also first culture minister
for a shorter period obviously, than as foreign minister, but at a very
critical point, right? This was when Singapore was in Malaysia at the time.
And he was, I think he became culture minister in 1959. So, you know, what,
what do you think his legacy was as culture minister?</p>
<p><strong>Irene</strong> 
<br>Well, it relates back to his great theme of his life, to create a multiracial
society and to bring the different races together to create a Singaporean
Singapore. But when he became culture minister in ’59, it was altogether
a different Singapore than what we experience today. In those days, the
different communal groups do not understand each other. They speak different
languages, they stay in different parts of the island, and they don’t interact
with one another. And there were also stereotypes and prejudices against
each other.</p>
<p>One of his greatest experiments was to bring the different races together
on the same stage so that they perform together. So you have a Chinese
dance, and then after that you have a Malay dance, and then you have Indian
drums. You get all the different performers to come on the same stage,
at the same time you draw the different races together as the audience.
It was quite controversial in those days because there are some purists
who believe that, why are you diluting the culture by mixing with the other
races? Because eventually what happened, which is what Rajaratnam wanted,
was there will be a Malay dance to Chinese music performed by Indians,
for instance, or a Chinese opera, set to Indian drums. But Rajaratnam wanted
that interaction between the different races so that they understand each
other and they can accept each other and hopefully see each other as fellow
Singaporeans.</p>
<p>So when he had this idea about people imagining themselves as one people,
you can only imagine yourself as one people if you experience it. So when
you’re gathered together, you’re standing next to an Indian, standing next
to a Malay and you’re Chinese, and you’re enjoying a performance together.
You don’t think of yourself as Chinese, you think yourself as a fellow
Singaporean. And that’s when the first imagination starts. And from imagining,
you become yourself, part of a greater whole and then you become a true
Singaporean because that’s what you identify yourself as first rather than
you think of, I’m Chinese first. No, I’m Singaporean first. But it all
starts from that kernel that he planted through the <a href="https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=8913c9be-2034-4193-b00a-3123deb31fbb" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Aneka Ragam</a> concerts,
the multicultural concerts which today we take for granted.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>I did not realise how important the Aneka Ragam concerts were. You mentioned
in your book also that he’s grossly unappreciated that he was the labour
minister when the British pulled out, or accelerated their pullout from
the region. And I think partly it’s unappreciated because, frankly, he
did a lot of stuff and it maybe was overshadowed, but it was actually important,
wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>Irene</strong> 
<br>You’re right. Partly it’s overshadowed, but partly it’s also because he’s
not the type to talk about himself or about his achievements. He never
talked about his labour ministry years, for instance, in his oral history.
Nobody asked him the question and he never volunteered. But the years that
he was labour minister, 1968 to 1971, were critical years when the British
were pulling out. And in fact, in 1968, when Singapore received a thunderbolt
of the British withdrawal, by 1971, there were already predictions that
Singapore could not survive because the British bases make up such a large
percentage of the economy in Singapore as well as employment.</p>
<p>So when Rajaratnam was parachuted into the labour minister’s hot seat,
he also had foreign minister’s job to worry about. But it was considered
important enough for him to do it. And I asked Mr Lee Kuan Yew why. Mr
Lee said, very frankly, he knew that Rajaratnam would not be daunted by
the problems and he would take them on. That’s him. He saw a problem, he
will rise to the challenge, he would take them on.</p>
<p>And the challenges were massive. Ten percent unemployment already and
that was before the British pulled out. And there was about 100,000 of
people who were going to be thrown out of jobs when the British pulled
out and there were about 25,000 new workers coming to the market after
school every year.</p>
<p>So all of these jobs have to be created. So Rajaratnam took the unpopular
decision, or rather the cabinet took the unpopular decision, but Rajaratnam
was given the task of carrying the unpopular decision through parliament.
And he succeeded again because of his personality, his experience and his
determination.</p>
<p>And he did it without losing the trust of the unions, which itself is
a major achievement. And the labour reforms that he pushed through in parliament
basically laid the foundation for the tripartite system that we find are
so useful for Singapore’s competitive advantage, and which remains today.
And I think it’s underappreciated because the credit is often given to
the technocrats. Usually Lee Kuan Yew, Goh Keng Swee. Usually these two
figures.</p>
<p>As my research shows, without Rajaratnam, none of their ideas would have
succeeded. Because you need someone to carry them through, to persuade
the people in parliament, and to talk to the unions, and to be a face that
they can trust. Because the unions at that point had a very tense relationship
with Lee Kuan Yew, because Lee Kuan Yew has been closing down unions or
being very harsh on them.</p>
<p>But Rajaratnam, with his personality and his patience in engaging the
unionists, brought them around eventually. And Goh Keng Swee is great with
that, with plans, but he is not a great communicator. But Rajaratnam put
it in very stark terms. You know, either we, stride forward, or we starve.
Very stark, very stark imagery.</p>
<p>So I think without Rajaratnam, we would not have survived that very critical
period. And because we did, here we are.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Actually, in addition to all that, he also had credibility, right? Because
he was a unionist at one point himself. He helped start up the Singapore
National Union of Journalists.</p>
<p><strong>Irene</strong> 
<br>That’s correct. You obviously read the book. The unionist knew him as
a rebel rouser because in his anti-colonial journalist days, he used to
have very close relations with the unionists. He founded the Union of Journalists
and he also founded the Unemployment Society in those days. So his concern
for the workers and for labour relations is been established, although
it’s not very widely known today. And Lee Kuan Yew how to use that to help
the government to implement this very tough labour reform.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Tell me you know, you first approached the trustees of his estate in,
back in 2004 to suggest writing his authorised biography. What made you
decide that you wanted to write his biography?</p>
<p><strong>Irene</strong> 
<br>Well, as I said, I’ve known him since the 1980s, and eventually, over
the years, as I began to drop in, in his house, I noticed that he was deteriorating,
as all of us would at some point. But it was particularly sad to see him
lose his mental edge. I thought that something must be written about him
so that people will not forget.</p>
<p>Rajaratnam has achieved so much that I’m so convinced that without Rajaratnam,
I think Singapore’s future would be so much darker. And I’m not sure whether
Lee Kuan Yew would have succeeded to the extent that he did. So I thought
it was very important to record that. So I started in 2004. I approached
Lee Kuan Yew for support because Lee Kuan Yew has just written his memoirs
and I thought it’s a good time to now start writing about Rajaratnam, and
immediately Mr Lee Kuan Yew gave his support and then I approached the
estate’s trustees because at that time Rajaratnam was no longer able to
make decisions for himself. He was suffering from dementia and the trustees
gave their support and also approached his family, his extended family,
because he has no children in Seramban, his two nephews and they gave their
support.</p>
<p>So with all the support, I could take on the mantle as an authorised biographer.
And with that, I get access to papers, especially his private papers. And
I went down to Seramban as well to speak to the relatives and to his friends
there and to look at the house. I had full access to his house in Chancery
Lane. So I spent quite a lot of time going through his boxes which were
gathering dust and discovering notebooks and photos and the kind of books
that he would devour.</p>
<p>He has 10,000 volumes, and I was heartbroken to just look at this man
and to realise that if he passes on and nobody knows his story, it would
be such a travesty. So I was just trying to do my part to tell his story
and make sure that he’s not forgotten as far as I can.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>I think you’ve done a tremendous job, and I say this because the second
volume, I devoured it because it was very interesting. It reads very well.
You managed to capture the drama. There are lots of interesting details.
What did you find was the biggest challenge in writing this volume? Which
was harder to write, the first or the second volume?</p>
<p><strong>Irene</strong> 
<br>Well, for the second volume, there was a massive amount of research because
of his years in the foreign ministry. And because I understand that the
issues relating to regional politics and regional relations are sensitive.
This is just a fact. I made sure that whatever I read, I master the sources.
I understand the nuances. And to do that, I have to read more.</p>
<p>So, let’s say I read an episode about Singapore relations with Malaysia
over one episode and I wanted to write about it and if I have any doubt,
any question, I will not start. I will continue researching. I will ask
for more papers or I’ll do more interviews to fill in the gaps. And that
takes time and sometimes, the most difficult part is what to leave out
after gathering all that material because everything is interesting, and
there are so many quotes that I wish I could have squeezed into the book,
but that would have made it very difficult to lift. I struggle over everything
that I leave out. And what I leave in, I make sure that, number one, it’s
accurate, can be supported by evidence, and number two, that it’s readable
and engaging. The context is put in place so that when a reader who doesn’t
know anything about regional politics, if they come into the book, they’ll
say, I understand it because it’s being told in a story. It is not told
in the form of academic treaties, as it were. It’s a story, so it’s something
that can draw people into the drama of the moment. So that itself takes
a lot of time because it’s a skill and it’s a skill that has to be constantly
honed because I’m never satisfied with the way I phrase things. It could
always be better. So I’ve done so many rewrites that I fear, I could have
taken longer if I allowed myself to do so, but I think, okay, there must
be a cut-off point, and so I cut off and here you have the book.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Can I ask you, and I want to give you this opportunity to, to address
something. You know, one, obviously you’ve done a lot of research. So I
just want to talk, one, about your research process, and two, you know,
what if people say, “Oh, you know, she’s a former PAP MP [Member of Parliament]
and she’s got access and MFA’s clearing everything. This is just a sanitised
version of this man. Why should we read it? It’s propaganda. What would
you say to that?</p>
<p><strong>Irene</strong> 
<br>That’s an excellent question. You know, I’m based in the UK now, and I’ve
been reading a lot of biographies. Partly as research, and partly also
because I want to understand the process that professional biographers
go through.</p>
<p>So, Winston Churchill has authorised biographers, so did Margaret Thatcher,
Charles Moore, who wrote three volumes, and in America, you have volumes
on Lyndon Johnson by a very serious biographer. And they also have access
to all the government papers and the private papers of their subjects.
But no one will accuse them of propaganda.</p>
<p>But in Singapore, I think that kind of question does reflect two things
to me. I think a serious biographer is quite a different sort of animal
as opposed to, let’s say, a Q&amp; A type of biographer, where you take
everything from the horse’s mouth and you just print it on paper. In my
case, there’s a lot of sifting going through. And true, I was a PAP MP.
And before that I was a journalist. But when I approached the biography,
I approached it as a serious biographer. I don’t wear my PAP hat on. I
do wear my journalist hat on in terms of analysing the data and writing.
But above all of that, I wear my serious biographer hat in the sense that
this is my subject, I want to make it compelling, I want to be accurate.
At the same time, I want to be fair. Fair to the man, fair to the times.
Because we can’t judge the man according to today’s standards. We have
to understand the context in which he worked, the trends that were swirling
around him, the thinking of the time, and the challenges of the time against
the circumstances of that time.</p>
<p>And for that, I have to go into his world, and I have to immerse myself
in those times. And that takes a certain kind of a mindset. And it’s not
a mindset that comes just because you think that I want to perpetuate a
propaganda. Because if you do that, then what’s the point of spending 20
years of my life to write propaganda? It’s not worth my life. It’s not
worth my time.</p>
<p>I’m a person who pursues something only if I feel it’s worthwhile. So,
spending 20 years of my life on one man, Rajaratnam, it’s a real investment
of my life. And I wouldn’t do it if it’s propaganda, you know, I would
only do it if I think it’s worthwhile. Something that I think is a story
worth telling, that can stand as public scrutiny, that can meet the criticisms
of the public once they read the book.</p>
<p>But if people come to the book with a sudden perception already, then
number one, they will read it with that lens that is propaganda, and then
they may not get the full flavour of the book in terms of the full complexity
of the man, his failures, his weaknesses, as well as his triumphs and his
achievements. But that’s what makes the man.</p>
<p>And if there’s any weakness that I have in this book, really, I think
it would be this. That I couldn’t have a third volume. Because there’s
so much more that I wanted to squeeze in into second volume. There’s so
much more. But it’s just about right to be two volumes. And I think hopefully
people would pick it up and read it with an open mind. And at the end of
it, judge it on its own merits, not thinking about whether this woman was
a PAP woman before, or whether she was trying to spread propaganda, as
you said. I consider myself a writer, a serious writer, who takes her job
very seriously. So I hope that it will meet the expectations of the people
when they read it.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>No one spends 20 years of their life on a project to create propaganda.
The whole book is a page turner and I think that’s a credit to the amount
of work you had to do in order to excavate all these details and all these
anecdotes that really make it come alive. And I have to say, reading this
book, you also see the man’s flaws. He was not possibly the world’s best
person at organising things. MFA is, you know, I’m sure it’s a wonderful
ministry, but I’m not sure how much of that organisation was due to Rajaratnam
himself versus maybe the civil servants who helped build it up. You brought
out the fact that organising people was not necessarily his strongest point.</p>
<p><strong>Irene</strong> 
<br>That’s right. I think there’s quite a lot of anecdotes about how he couldn’t
remember his staff, couldn’t remember their salary ranks, and it took
<a href="https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=c3eb8a5c-9abe-4678-8304-61dc7eeb2368" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Dhanabalan</a>, his successor, to really set that ship on the right track.
So yes, I was quite frank and detailed about his weaknesses as well, but
when it comes to the larger picture, his strategic oversight, his mastering
of the geopolitics, basically trumps housekeeping details.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Well, just to reassure everyone that one, this is not a hagiography, and
two, it’s a good read. I really enjoyed it.</p>
<p><strong>Irene</strong> 
<br>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>So moving away from these very heavy topics, we just want to wind up this
podcast by asking hopefully a lighter question. So, Irene, what do you
read for leisure?</p>
<p><strong>Irene</strong> 
<br>Well, I’ve been reading a lot of biographies but I’m trying to move to
fiction because I think that fiction can really pique your interest in
terms of how you visualise different worlds. And that’s what Rajaratnam
did as well. He reads so widely. Science fiction as well ,and comics, and
because they, they give you a different window to the world and translations
of great works from authors from different parts of the world. All these
are a crucial tool widening our mental framework. So I’m trying to move
more into fiction, although my inclination is always to read biographies
because for me it’s a job. So it’s like a quite useful tool set. And when
I read a biography, I don’t read so much for the content as much as for
the technique, but now that this book is over, I’ll go back to fiction
and I’m picking up Tan Twan Eng, which is a Penang-born author who’s made
waves internationally with historical novels, and I find that quite fascinating.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>In writing all this, which biographies inspired you?</p>
<p><strong>Irene</strong> 
<br>Well, I look for techniques in award-winning biographies.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Right.</p>
<p><strong>Irene</strong> 
<br>So, Caro, who wrote the five volumes of Lyndon Johnson.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Robert Caro.</p>
<p><strong>Irene</strong> 
<br>Robert Caro. And I took heart in the fact that between volumes four and
five, he took more than 10 years. And I was listening to his interviews
as well, to understand his writing process, and I found that helpful and
also validating because he had the same problem as I did, which is the
massive amount of material that you have and how to write that and combine
all the different episodes into a fascinating read.</p>
<p>And he’s a very respected biographer. Another that I enjoy reading is
Charles Moore. He’s the authorised biographer of Margaret Thatcher, and
he had access to all her files, and also government papers. And one point
he made is that, which was quite interesting to me, because there was a
debate about, in Singapore at least, about the Freedom of Information Act,
whether all files should be released to whoever who asked for it.</p>
<p>And Charles Moore himself felt that it would be a pity if that was the
case, because then politicians would be very careful about what they write
down. And not only that, they would leave out very important decisions
that they made, and so you have no clue about how they make decisions.
Whereas in his case, and also in my case, because everything is noted down
in documents, I had access to how they basically frame their arguments
for a certain decision.</p>
<p>For instance, the hanging of the Marines in 1968. I revealed for the first
time in my book that Rajaratnam basically did not agree with Lee Kuan Yew’s
decision to go ahead and hang the Marines for the terrorist attacks on
McDonald’s house. And that’s the first time that anyone has heard of it.
But it’s only possible because there were primary documents carefully kept
and when I read Charles Moore’s comment about how he appreciates that.
If the politicians of today in UK will be more circumspect and a biographer
in the future, would find it very hard to put together a very accurate
account of their subjects because of the Freedom of Information Act that’s
now in the UK.</p>
<p>And so for the role of a serious biographer, if you have access to the
papers, it’s a privilege, but you also have to handle it with sensitivity,
in the sense that you come to it with a sense of fairness. You discover
new facets of the character, you double check accounts, because even what’s
on paper may contradict with another account.</p>
<p>So it takes quite a bit of investigative work and that’s what Charles
Moore did as well. So I found it, number one, validating. At the same time,
it’s also quite encouraging as I pursue this course of trying to make sure
that my biography of Rajaratnam is as authoritative and credible as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>You’ve been a journalist, you’ve been an MP, and now you’re the foremost,
world’s foremost expert on Rajaratnam. What are your plans next?</p>
<p><strong>Irene</strong> 
<br>I think writing is in my blood. You know, I started off as a journalist.
It’s my first job, and I stayed in the job until I joined politics. And
even then, I felt that I needed to write, and therefore, I started on this
book on Rajaratnam. So I think I’ll continue writing, but what I will write
about is something that I will have to reflect on, and also think what
will be worthwhile for me to do going forward.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Will you be spending 20 years of your life on it?</p>
<p><strong>Irene</strong> 
<br>Hopefully not.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>It’s a long time. We know what Rajaratnam’s Singapore dream was, right?
It’s encompassed in the pledge. What, Irene, is your Singapore dream? Or
what is your dream for Singapore?</p>
<p><strong>Irene</strong> 
<br>If I may just go back to Rajaratnam’s dream, One reason why I identify
so much with that dream is because I was an outsider in Singapore.</p>
<p>I was born in Malaysia, in Penang to be exact, and I’ve lived for the
first 16 years under a communal system. I’ve experienced what it’s like
to be identified based on your race. So where your race and your skin colour
basically determines your life chances. So if you’re Chinese, you can’t
rise above a certain level in Malaysia because, purely because of your
classification as Chinese.</p>
<p>So you may be a good student, you may even be a top student, but it doesn’t
mean you can get a scholarship. Doesn’t even mean that you can get into
university because of the quota system. And even if you may be the most
hardworking person in the office, doesn’t mean you get to the top. But
in Singapore, when I came over, I really appreciate the system because
it is truly meritocratic.</p>
<p>I had no relatives here. I came without any friends. I started from scratch
with nothing. And when I joined as a journalist, there were far more high-flying
people around me. SPH [Singapore Press Holdings] scholars from Oxford,
Cambridge. At that point, I had a degree from the NUS [National University
of Snigapore]. Basically, in those days, the political desks were made
up of SPH scholars.</p>
<p>But the fact that I was able to be where I was and to be tapped on the
shoulder for politics is something that I think would only happen because
I was in Singapore. And this also goes back to how the foundations were
laid by the founding generation of a meritocratic, non-communal nation.
And because of that dream that the founding generation had, which has achieved
by the time I became a journalist, I enjoyed the fruits of it.</p>
<p>But I never took it for granted because I’ve experienced the other side.
So my Singapore dream is for this dream to continue and I do not take it
for granted. And I don’t think anybody should. Because of the rise of ethnic
sentiments, of demagogues appealing to ethno-nationalist sentiments as
well, and you have foreign powers trying to work through the populations
by pulling on their ancestral heartstrings, on ethnic bonds. I think Singaporeans
just have to continue to remember that what we have is exceptional and
special, and it’s been the product of great sacrifice and struggle by the
preceding generations.</p>
<p>And therefore our generation has to take it forward and make it better
and be an inspiration to the world who face similar problems but could
never work out a solution.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>It seems to me that in some ways, Rajaratnam’s dream of a meritocratic
society based on justice and equality is something that very much appeals
to you. It was one of the things that probably drew you to the whole topic
to begin with, wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>Irene</strong> 
<br>Precisely that. It resonated with me. And you’re absolutely right that’s
what kept me going. This realisation of how special this ideal is and how
important it is to make sure that we continue to be the keeper of the flame.</p>
<p>So one point that I hope the government will take up is to enshrine this
National Pledge to be on par with the constitution. Because I do fear that
because it’s taken for granted so much, and political moods change, there’s
intellectual fashions change, and the pledge could be changed also, by
a future government, even retracted, merely by gazette, and there goes,
poof, the vision of your founding generation. I hope that the National
Pledge could be protected and preserved for the future generation by treating
it on par with the constitution, which requires a two-thirds majority for
any amendment. I think that would be one important way to make sure that
the aspirations in the pledge, as well as being a very powerful symbolic
move to the world, that Singapore will remain special, not only today,
but tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>I will sign a petition for that. Irene, thank you very much for joining
us on BiblioAsia+. I do want to urge everyone to read Irene’s latest book,<em> <a href="https://catalogue.nlb.gov.sg/search/card?recordId=300059306" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">The Lion’s Roar</a>,</em> the
second volume of her authorised biography on Rajaratnam. It’s available,
of course, in bookstores and in libraries. So you can buy it or borrow
it. For a taste of what’s in the book, <em>BiblioAsia </em>has published
an <a href="https://biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg/vol-20/issue-3/oct-dec-2024/rajaratnam-biography-lions-roar/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">extract</a> from
that book, and you can find it on the <em>BiblioAsia </em>website at biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg.</p>
<p>Irene, once again, thank you very much for being here, and I know it’s
a very hot day, and you had to walk from the Istana. So she’s that kind
of person who will walk from the Istana all the way to the National Archives
and we’re truly privileged to have you both as a guest and that someone
bothered to do such an amazing job on Rajaratnam. Thank you very much,
Irene.</p>
<p><strong>Irene</strong> 
<br>Thank you, Jimmy. You’re wonderful as well.</p>
