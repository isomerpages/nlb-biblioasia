In Singapore, notifications of all new laws passed by parliament are officially announced in the government gazette, a time-honoured practice that continues to this day.1 One of its earliest iterations was the *Straits Government Gazette*, published in 1858 when Singapore was still a part of the Straits Settlements and under the government of the Colonial Office of Calcutta in India. Similar in content to the gazette published today, the gazette at the time contained proclamations by the governors, announcements of new government appointments as well as notices of new ordinances.2

The front page of the first issue, dated 1 January 1858, consists of the title of the gazette in Gothic script, the crest of the 
Straits Settlements and a note asserting that the gazette “will be the only Official organ for Publications, Notifications and 
other Public Papers of this Government”.3
 The 
first issue was printed on paper embossed 
with the watermark of the British East India 
Company (EIC), while subsequent issues used 
stocks of noticeably lower quality paper.4
So thorough was the gazette that 
seemingly unimportant details of the size, 
length and price of the paper are found on 
the last page, where it states that the issue 
contained “6–8 pages of Foolscap size. Per 
mensem 50 cent. Copy 25.”
The gazette was divided into sections 
and comprised notifications, notices and 
other news. Notifications typically included 
official announcements of new port rules, 
information about appointments or leave 
taken within the civil service, as well as bills 
and ordinances passed by the Legislative 
Council in India.
Notices consisted of announcements 
from the post office, calls for tender and 
regular reminders from the commissioner 
of police. From the 1860s onwards, the 
gazette began including other information such as timetables for mail services 
to India, China and Australia; notices of 
marriages, divorces, insolvency, burials; 
and collections for relief funds. Gradually, 
weather tables, shipping news and import 
tariffs were also published in the gazette, 
reflecting the importance of the Straits 
Settlements as key trading posts in the 
network established by the British.
The gazette employed the same layout 
and maintained its minimal, graphic-free 
aesthetic throughout its life. The only adornment was the header crest of the Straits 
Settlements, which went through several 
revisions over the years. The gazette was 
printed by Mission Press, the sole printing 
press in Singapore at the time.
The Straits Government Gazette can 
trace its origins to some 30 years earlier 
in October 18285
 when it began as the 
weekly Government Gazette of Prince of 
Wales Island, Singapore and Malacca.

It contained announcements by the government, occasionally accompanied by 
Jawi translations, as well as news from 
India and Europe, currency updates and, 
quite oddly, selections from works of 
English literature.7
