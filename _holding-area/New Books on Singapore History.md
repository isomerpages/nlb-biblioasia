Call no. RSING 297.355957 MOH

This book is a window into the history of pioneer Muslims from the state of Kerala on India’s Malabar coast. The determination and vision of a few men from the Malabar Muslim community eventually enabled the completion of the Malabar Muslim Jama-Ath Mosque in Singapore in 1963.

This distinctive blue mosque is prominently located at the junction of Victoria Street and Jalan Sultan, and has become a local landmark. It also plays an important role in the life of the Indian Muslim community here.

The author pieces together information gleaned from old official records, newspaper articles, photographs and interviews to tell the little-known story of a mosque that is part of Singapore’s built heritage.

#### The Comfort Women of Singapore in History and Memory
by Kevin Blackburn

NUS Press, 208 pages. <br>
Call no. RSING 940.5405082095957 BLA-[WAR]

Why did no former comfort women from Singapore come forward to tell their stories when others across Asia began to do so publicly in the 1990s? To understand this silence, this book details the sex industry serving the Japanese military during the wartime occupation of Singapore: the comfort stations, managers, procurers, and girls and women who either volunteered or were forced into service and, in many cases, sexual slavery. 

With care, balance and sensitivity given to a difficult subject, the author turns from history to the public presence of the comfort women in Singapore’s memory and reveals how these women became known in Singapore in the 1990s and 2000s.
