In 1952, four Singapore artists – Liu Kang, Chen Chong Swee, Chen Wen Hsi and Cheong Soo Pieng – visited Java and Bali to seek inspiration. Their trip led to an exhibition held the next year that has been hailed as a major milestone in Singapore’s art history. Despite this, few details of the trip were ever revealed. _Bali 1952_ showcases more than 250 black-and-white photographs taken by Liu Kang during the seven-week adventure. These photographs, most of which have never been seen, tell the story of a remarkable journey that has left a lasting legacy on Singapore’s art history.

The unexpected end of the Cold War in 1991 dissolved the Soviet Union into 15 free and independent states. These countries, which were once subject to Soviet control, were faced with the presence of Russian troops in their territories. This is an account of the author’s trip to Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in 1993 to help these countries come to an agreement with Russia on when and how its troops would leave.

Established in 1930, the Malayan Communist Party (MCP) grew to become one of the most successful communist parties in Asia by 1946, with members numbering in the thousands. By examining almost two decades of its tumultuous history, the writer explains why the MCP embarked on a path of self-destruction in 1948, raises questions about postwar politics that led inevitably to armed struggle and questions the accepted narrative of Party Chairman Lai Teck’s treachery.
