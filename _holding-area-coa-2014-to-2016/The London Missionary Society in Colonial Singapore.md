#### **Introduction**
It did not take long for the London Missionary Society (LMS ) to arrive in
Singapore after Stamford Raffles of the British East India Company signed
a treaty with Sultan Hussein Mahmud Shah on 6 February 1819 to establish
a trading post on the island. The first missionary arrived a few months later,
on 18 October 1819. Samuel Milton set up a mission house on Bras Basah
Road and was subsequently joined in 1822 by Claudius Henry Thomsen,
who had transferred from the mission in Malacca.

Raffles had already had contact with the LMS missionaries in Malacca,
describing Reverend William Milne as “a liberal, well-informed, excellent
man”.1 He thought less of several other missionaries he had met there and,
presumably questioning their effectiveness, wrote, “Had I been a Missionary
myself I think I could have evangelised the whole island by this time.”2 He
was nonetheless interested in their printing presses, seeing the potential of
the presses for secular use. He engaged the LMS missionaries in Singapore
to print his first proclamations – 50 copies in English and 50 copies in
Malay. Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir, who had been Raffles’ Malay teacher, secretary and interpreter, was now working with the missionaries and
described the laborious process and the pressure they were under:

   *For two days I sat making types… At last at three o’clock in the<br> 
   morning all was finished, for the same morning, which was the<br> 
   first day of the new year, they wanted to publish the laws. Work<br> 
   went on and on and the perspiration poured off us. Eyes drooped<br> 
   and stomachs felt the pangs of hunger, all because the task had to<br> 
   be finished that night. For Mr. Raffles had insisted that it be ready<br> 
   by the next morning. And the next morning the notices were posted<br> 
   in every quarter of the town*.3

By February 1823, Thomsen had written to London noting that “we are now
printing in English &amp; Malay &amp; have a small Type-Foundery &amp; are doing
bookbinding. Government has been pleased to honour our little Press…
with printing all public Documents both in English and Malay.”4

In this early entanglement of Empire and religion, I would like to explore
the motivations of these missionary printers, the challenges they faced and
their contributions to early printing in Singapore. What brought them from
Britain to the other side of the world? And what did they achieve?

#### **On a Mission**
The last years of the 18th century saw a surge of evangelical Protestant
revival in Britain. This was triggered by a range of complex social and
economic changes, which included the rise of a comfortable middle class
with money to spend on charity and good works; an aspiring working
class with a desire for self-improvement through adult education; and the
expansion of commerce and influence abroad, largely through the growing
markets of the British East India Company.

The successful expeditions of Captain James Cook to the Pacific added to
this sense of economic expansion at home and abroad, and, for Christian
evangelists, an optimism about the possibilities of spreading the gospel to far-flung lands – particularly urgent for those who believed in a forthcoming
millennium when Christ would return to earth and all would be judged.
Several missionary societies, set up to send forth Christian missionaries,
were formed within a few years of one another – the Baptist Missionary
Society in 1792, the London Missionary Society in 1795, the Church
Missionary Society in 1799 and the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society
in 1813.5

The public meeting held in September 1795 to formally establish the LMS
attracted such fanfare that many people started arriving an hour before the
appointed time, and thousands more had to be turned away.6 Most were
from non-conformist or dissenting churches, believing in a simple style
of worship based on the scriptures. They had come to hear about plans to
spread Christianity “among heathen and other unenlightened nations”.7

It is easy to read these words today as evidence of a sense of racial
or cultural superiority. Yet we need to understand them through the
evangelical prism of the time, bound up with the belief of salvation – that
is, only those who believed in Christ could be “saved” and go to Heaven.
Thus the duty of the evangelical Christian was to spread the gospel widely
across nations, so that as many souls as possible might be saved. As one
preacher put it, “Ye were once pagans, living in cruel and abominable
idolatry. The servants of Jesus came from other lands… And ought you
not… to send messengers to the nations which are in like conditions to
yourselves of old.”8

Another preached that:

   *Possessing, as they do, the same feelings of nature as ourselves,<br> 
   the same moral wants, the same faculties of improvement, the<br> 
   same dread of misery, the same desire of happiness, and the same<br> 
   capacity of enjoyment, ought we not zealously to endeavour that<br> 
   they may also become partakers of like precious faith with us, and<br> 
   sharers in the same common salvation*.9

While some individuals might have felt themselves racially superior, the
evangelical doctrine was egalitarian in the belief that the gospel could save
*all* who embraced it. Brian Stanley has argued that:

   *For most of the nineteenth century, if the missionary movement can<br> 
   be accused of racism, the racism was of a “soft” kind. It was based,<br> 
   not on any notion of permanent biological inequality between<br> 
   races, but on obstinately deep-rooted convictions about differences<br> 
   between “civilized” and “uncivilized” peoples, which were<br> 
   explained in terms of a causal connection between Christianity<br> 
   and the regenerative process of “civilization”*.10
	 
Translating scripture into local languages was considered crucial and for this
they needed printing presses and people skilled enough to operate them.
Volunteers came forward and the first mission was despatched in late 1796
to Tahiti. Although this was not a success,11 further missions were sent to
Africa and the West Indies, with China – and its huge population – viewed
as the big prize.

A mission to China had been considered at the very first meeting of the
Society. Trade with China was burgeoning during this period, with tea
in high demand. In London, shops were selling Chinese silk, porcelain,
lacquerware and furniture, yet it was an ambivalent relationship: David
Porter has suggested that the 18th-century consumer was infatuated with
Chinese and Chinese-styled goods, “even as they were amused, perplexed, or troubled by the alien aesthetic sensibility these goods embodied”, finding
these Chinese objects and aesthetic ideas “at once alluring and repulsive,
charming and grotesque, strange and strangely familiar”.12

This was also a time when Britain made new efforts to make official
diplomatic connections with China – Lord Macartney had undertaken
his embassy to the imperial court in China from 1793 to 1794.13 The
Emperor’s rejection of his gifts and requests to permanently station a British
ambassador in Peking, and thus open up Chinese ports to British trade,
reinforced views of the differences between East and West. It also meant,
as Ross Forman has argued, that China was “one place where Britain was
forced to recognise… the agency of a people and culture that they were
actively trying to control, classify, or otherwise contain”.14

The LMS founders were keen to get to China to preach the gospel but,
besides the practicalities of getting missionaries there, it was difficult to
find dictionaries or teachers of Chinese languages. William Milne, who
would eventually be sent to China and then Malacca, wrote that “there were
no helps in English, to assist in the acquisition of the Chinese language –
England knew, and cared little about China, beyond its commerce”.15

Nonetheless, their first missionary to China, Robert Morrison, arrived in
1807, but the imperial restrictions on foreigners meant that he was limited
to Canton (now Guangzhou) in the trading season and to Macao at other
times. It was forbidden to teach Chinese languages to foreigners and by the
time the second missionary, William Milne, arrived in 1813, an imperial
edict had made it a capital offence to publish Christian texts in Chinese.
Clear that the mission could not expand beyond Morrison’s presence,
a decision was made for Milne to explore other locations in the region, where a base could be established while waiting for China to open up to
foreign missions.

Malacca was chosen because it had a sizeable Chinese population and
was along a busy trade route. Milne relocated there, together with printer
Liang A-Fa, and was joined shortly after by Claudius Henry Thomsen,
who concentrated on Malay, and his language tutor, Abdullah bin
Abdul Kadir. This was a more successful enterprise: they established
small schools, procured land for what was to become the Anglo-Chinese
College and, by the end of 1820, had produced some 140,000 books and
periodicals in Chinese, and over 20,000 items in Malay.16 In 1819, bases
were also established in Penang, Singapore and Batavia (now Jakarta) –
together with Malacca and their small China presence, they formed the
Ultra-Ganges Mission.

The Singapore mission started well. Milton concentrated on translations
into the Chinese and Siamese languages, while Thomsen focused on the
Malay and Bugis languages. They were sufficiently well-regarded that Raffles
was keen for the Society’s successful Anglo-Chinese College in Malacca to
move to Singapore as part of his planned Singapore Institution, with the
missionaries taking key teaching roles. Despite the laying of the foundation
stone in 1823, the transfer of the College did not materialise. Nonetheless,
the arrival of more printing presses in 1822 enabled Milton and Thomsen to
begin printing the evangelical texts that they had been translating, as well
as undertake printing for commercial firms and the government as a way
of earning income for the mission. In this way, Mission Press became the
printer for Singapore’s first newspaper, the *Singapore Chronicle*, from 1824
to 1830.17

The missionaries handed out their Christian tracts during rounds of house
visits in the town and the interior of the island, with “each perambulation
taking up to 6 to 8 weeks and renewed at uncertain intervals of 3 or 4
months”.18 The tracts were also distributed on ships in the harbour, partly in the hope that some would ultimately reach China. The 1830 report of
the Singapore Christian Union (composed mainly of the LMS missionaries
and the Anglican chaplain) described how they distributed 60 Bibles, 200
testaments and 4,000 tracts on board junks and small boats.19

There were ups and downs. Printing work in Singapore was disrupted for
some years when an LMS delegation “discharged” Milton in 1825 – he had
gotten carried away with grandiose schemes, offended the Resident, and his
colleagues in Malacca thought him “insane” – leaving the mission without
a Chinese focus for a period of more than 10 years. Another LMS delegation
visited the next year and this time concluded that Thomsen was someone
“destitute of missionary talent”, who had concentrated on his own commercial
interests, leading to “the most complete inactivity as to all missionary duties”.20
He was included in a list of “troublemakers” for the Society, described as
“perpetual blisters” that the Society “seem(ed) destined to carry”.21

The LMS directors in London resolved at this point to abandon a permanent
mission in Singapore, but subsequently rescinded the decision. Thomsen
remained and produced some key works during this period, including a
Malay translation of the *Sermon on the Mount* and the *English-Malay-Bugis
Vocabulary*. Nonetheless, he left in 1834 after some seemingly unfounded
rumours that he had taken up with local women. He maintained that he
owned the presses and some of the land, and sold them to the American
Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM), controversially
leaving the LMS without an effective printing set-up.22 The mission was
largely vacant until January 1838, except for two short periods of occupation
by Samuel Wolfe.23

The ABCFM ran the press until 1843, doing some printing for the LMS ,
particularly after the arrival of further, more capable members of the LMS
mission: the Stronach brothers in 1838; Benjamin Keasberry in 1839 (to
whom they loaned a press); and Samuel Dyer, who transferred from Malacca
in 1842. When China at last “opened up” to foreigners after the First Opium
War, the Board closed its mission in Singapore and the press and land were
given back to the LMS . The “wait for China” was over.

By 1847, the LMS had also formally closed its mission in Singapore.
Keasberry elected to remain and continue his work, with some limited
assistance from the London headquarters, running a successful school for
Malay boys, preaching in his Malay chapel and continuing translating
and printing. He died in 1875 and the presses were sold commercially, thus
ending any lingering LMS presence in Singapore.

There are some physical reminders in Singapore today of the LMS presence:
Prinsep Street Presbyterian Church (where Keasberry had his Malay Chapel,
now a National Monument); Glory Presbyterian Church, formerly the Bukit
Timah church established by Keasberry; St Margaret’s School, which had its
beginnings in Maria Dyer’s school for Chinese girls; and Zion Road, named
for Keasberry’s Mount Zion mission station. To consider the intangible
impacts of their time in Singapore and the region, it is useful to first look at
the practical challenges they faced and how they approached their mission,
before assessing their legacy.
