title: Reviving the Silk Road and the Role of Singapore
permalink: /vol-4/issue1/apr-2008/silk-road-reviving/
description: The possibility of the Middle East emerging as a new economic giant
  in this new century has given rise to romantic notions of a “New Silk Road”
  that would link Asia and the Middle East. While China’s ancient capital
  Chang’an had served as the point of departure for travellers using the Silk
  Road, Singapore could perhaps be the modern-day Chang’an and be the bridge
  between Asia and the Middle East.
