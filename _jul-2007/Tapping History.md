#### I've been through Taban Valley at Bukit Timah Nature Reserve many times and never realised until recently how historically important these unprepossessing trees are. To the uninitiated, they look like skinny durian trees with their dark green leaves. A century and a half ago, the Taban Merah (Pafaquium gutta), better known to the world as Gutta Percha, was at the centre of an earth-shaking infocomm revolution as great as the introduction of the Internet.

#### **Discovery**

Gutta Percha was traditionally used in this region to fashion handles for tools. However, it was unknown to the West except for a single specimen called 'mazer wood' in the collection of naturalist John Tradescant (1608–1652). The Tradescant collection grew to become Oxford's present Ashmolean Museum.

In 1842, an enterprising Malay man started selling Gutta Percha whips in Singapore. Unfortunately. I have not been able to discover this man's name anywhere. By 1843, his whips were available in London. However, Gutta Percha whips never became more than a novelty.

At this time, Jose d'Almeida who ran a dispensary at Commercial Square (today's Raffles Place), went back to Europe for a visit in 1842. He brought along samples of Gutta Percha with him. The samples were presented to the Royal Asiatic Society in London but no real notice was taken of it. This bad fortune in things agricultural extended to his attempt at starting a plantation in Singapore: he tried planting without commercial success many different crops like cotton, coffee and vanilla. However, he was quite successful in the world of trade: after helping two ships sell their cargos, he went on to found a successful trading company, Jose d'Aimeida & Co. Almeida was also knighted by his ruler, the Queen of Portugal, and made Consul General to the Straits Settlements during his trip back home.

It was left to a fellow resident of Singapore, Dr William Morrtgomerie, to successfully introduce Gutta Percha to the world.

Dr William Montgomerie is generally credited to be the first person to notice Gutta Percha in 1822 during his first tour of duty in Singapore (1819 to 1826). However, it was only when he became Senior Surgeon to the Straits Settlement  (1829 to 1844) that he investigated the substance more closely. He sent a letter to the Bengal Medical Board in 1843, recommending that Gutta Percha be developed for use in medical instruments. This was followed by samples to the Society of Arts in 1845 for which the Society awarded him a gold medal (the Society of Arts became the Royal Society of Arts only in 1847 when it was given a Royal Charter). More importantly, the Society exhibited the samples, which sparked off much experimentation with the substance.

Among other things Gutta Percha was found to be good for making golf balls, adhesives, and as root canal fillings in dentistry. Even today, if you are unfortunate enough to need root canal treatment, the dentist will probably use Gutta Percha for your root canal filling. Gutta Percha is one of the best substances for ensuring that the cavity is completely filled without leaving any microscopic space where bacteria can resume its attack. The secret behind its varied uses is its changeability- in hot water (around 69 to 65°C, depending on the purity), it becomes plastic and moldable while at room temperature it is firm enough to be made into furniture. Of course you might want to avoid serving a hot meal on a Gutta Percha dining table! 

#### **Telegraphy**

In 1837, Cooke and Wheatstone filed their patent for a telegraph system in England while Morse filed his patent in the United States the year after. Very quickly, the first long-distance telegraph lines were set up: the first being the famous Washington-Baltimore line. This line was opened on 24 May 1844 when Samuel Morse sent his famous 'What hath God wrought?' message across it. The telegraph allowed messages to be sent and received immediately across long distances- it was a communications breakthrough in an era when couriers were the fastest way to send messages. For instance, the front page news of the Singapore Chronicle and Commercial Register on 16 September 1837 announced the death of King William IV and that Victoria would be the next ruler- news three months old! (King William IV died on 20 June 1837).

However, there was one problem preventing a worldwide telegraph net: how do you insulate telegraph cable underwater? On land, air does not conduct electricity, which makes the job easy. However, in water, a reliable airtight casing for the copper wire was needed as water, especially salt water, conducts electricity well. In addition, the material had to be flexible and be able to withstand high pressures and cold temperatures without deteriorating. Materials like lead, wax, tar and caoutchoouc (rubber) were tried without success. Bridges had to be built for cables to be strong across rivers- never mind oceans.

By coincidence, samples of Gutta Percha from Singapore had started arriving in London in 1843. The very next year, various people had seized on it as a possible telegraph cable insulator and experimentation started on how to manufacture such insulated cables. Four years later in Germany, Werner Siemens was the first to develop a working machine press for making a seamless Gutta Percha cable coating. This development enabled telegraph cables to be laid along the floor of the ocean and by the 1870s, telegraph cables circled the globe. Telegraphen-BauanstaFt von Siemens & HaLske, the company founded by Mr Siemens and his brother, also prospered - this was the start of today's multinational electronics company, Siemens AG.

In 1850, the first undersea cable was laid between England and France, and 1858 saw the first attempt to lay a transatlantic cable - a feat finally achieved in 1866. While Cyrus Field has gone down in history as the man who connected the United States to Europe, it was Gutta Percha from Singapore that made it possible.

The telegraph story would not be complete without mentioning when Singapore became connected to the world. Singapore's first telegraphic cable connection was to Batavia but the first line broke after the first message. it was only on 31 December 1870 that the British Australian Telegraph Company finished laying a telegraph line from Madras to Singapore. A few days later, on 6 January 1871, an advertisement appeared in the newspapers announcing the opening of the telegraph lines between Singapore, Penang, Java and Madras. This allowed telegraph messages to be sent to Europe and even to the Americas! The cost was not cheap though: a twenty-word message to London cost 24 Straits dollars and to New York, the princely sum of 53.60 Straits dollars!
