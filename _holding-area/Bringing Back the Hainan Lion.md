#### **The unexpected find of a cape with tiger markings in the storeroom of the Guang Wu Club led a martial artist and lion dance master to revive a lost art form in Singapore.**

When martial artist and lion dance master Raymond Foo, the head of 光武国术团 (Guang Wu Guoshu Tuan or Guang Wu Club), was about 15 years old, he chanced upon a cape with tiger markings in the club’s storeroom. He had come across the Hainan lion in photos and trained in martial arts and lion dance since he was 12, but no one could tell him what this striped cape was.&nbsp; His quest for answers brought him to Hainan Island and set him on a path to reviving and preserving an art form lost to Singapore.

An advocate of all things Hainanese, Foo has more than 50 years’ experience in martial arts and lion dance. Established in 1936, Guang Wu Club is the only organisation in Singapore that promotes the elusive Hainan lion dance (海南狮; Hainan _shi_), also known as 琼州狮 _(_Qiongzhou _shi)_, the Hainan tiger dance (海南虎; Hainan _hu_) and Hainan _qiong pai_ martial arts (琼派功夫; _qiong pai gong fu_). Even though the Hainan tiger dance is rarely performed in Singapore today, its influence on Hainan lion dance can still be seen.

#### **The Hainan Tiger**

In 2016, Foo went to Hainan Island to find out more about the origins of the mysterious tiger cape. He started his journey in Luowu Village in Sanjiang Town, Melian District, Haikou Hainan (海口市美兰区三江镇罗梧村; Haikoushi meilan qu sanjiang zhen luo wu cun), said to be the home of the Hainan tiger dance, which has a history of more than 300 years.

When Foo saw the full Hainan tiger at Luowu Village, he was astonished that it bore many similarities to the Hainan lion head in Gwang Wu’s possession in Singapore. The Hainan tiger had been brought to Singapore in the 1960s but it did not appeal to the masses, and thus rarely performed. At the time, the people were much more familiar with the Southern or Foshan (佛山), lion dance from Guangdong, especially during the Lunar New Year, and preferred a lion over a tiger to perform the “plucking of greens” (採青; _cai qing_) ritual to usher in good fortune and tidings.

The tiger dance is a tribute to the bravery and strength of Lady Xian (冼太夫人; Xian Tai Furen, c. 522–602 AD) and is still performed today during the annual Junpo Festival (军坡节; Jun Bo Jie) celebrated between the first and third lunar months (around February and March) on Hainan Island in the town of Xinpo. A rich cultural and religion event, the festival coincides with the start of spring and the tiger dance is performed to pray for a bountiful harvest, clement weather, the safety of animals and people and prosperity.[^1]  Lady Xian’s father was the chieftain of the Xian clan (or Baiyue) of the Li people in Southern China (modern day Guangdong). She was a politician and militarist who fostered good ties among neighbouring clans as well as with the Han Chinese.[^2] Her people were frequently embroiled in conflict with other clans, which she sought to prevent through diplomacy and negotiation.

However, her brother, Xian Ting (刺史), the governor of Nanliangzhou (南梁州), had grown arrogant and greedy from wealth acquired largely through trade with the Han Chinese. He would harass nearby counties and seize their possessions, causing widespread suffering in the Lingnan (岭南) region. Lady Xian repeatedly advised her brother against such actions, gradually easing public resentment toward him. She promoted political unity and cooperation among the various ethnic groups in the Lingnan region and devoted her life to building racial harmony between the Li people and the neighbouring communities and growing the local economy by developing agriculture after witnessing the suffering and disasters caused by war.

One of her notable reforms was the abolishment of the Li people’s traditional servitude system, which helped integrate her people more closely into the broader social and political structures of the Southern Dynasties (420–589 AD), while also improving social order and justice.

The tiger dance was introduced to Hainan from the Central Plains during the Ming Dynasty and is still popular in the rural areas around Sanjiang Town. The Hainan tiger dance features routines such as fighting tigers and solo tiger performances. Each dance troupe comprises about 20 to 30 performers, and each tiger requires two dancers – one as its head and the other as the tail. While the tiger dance features movements similar to the Hainan lion dance, its dancers adopt a much lower stance than that of the Hainan lion, allowing them to draw strength from deep, rooted stances that mirror the animal’s low, prowling gait. The tiger’s force —&nbsp;虎劲&nbsp;(_hu jin_) — rises from the ground, gathering in the dancers’ hips and spines before releasing in sudden, explosiveness (爆发力, _baofali_) that give the dance its unmistakable power. In embodying the tiger, every crouch, creep and pounce depends on staying close to the ground, allowing the dancers to channel the creature’s stealth, tension, and raw momentum. Other troupe members take on roles such as soldiers and deities – namely the Chinese earth god 土地公 (Tu Di Gong) and his wife 土地婆 (Tu Di Po).[^3]
