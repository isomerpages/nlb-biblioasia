Inspired by the National Library Singapore’s exhibition of the same name that was launched in 2017, Tales of the Malay World features more than 60 rare early manuscripts and lithographed books from centuries past, at a time when Malay was the dominant language of trade, diplomacy, religious discourse and literature in maritime Southeast Asia. In this unique catalogue, items from the National Library’s own collection are joined by exhibits from institutions such as The British Library, the University of Leiden, and the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, marking the first time these treasures have been presented together in a single publication. Detailed images of the works are complemented by commentaries from international experts, helping to illuminate our understanding of early Malay manuscripts and, by extension, the societies that produced them.
