Professor Yu Chun Yee previously taught at the Royal College of Music in London. At age 18, he won the prestigious Singapore Musical Societyâ€™s pianoforte competition in 1955 judged by Julius Katchen. Here, Yu plays on the recently [refurbished Chappell grand](/vol-19/issue-3/oct-dec-2023/chappell-piano-repair-zhivko-girginov/) once used by international pianists at the Victoria Memorial Hall. A cheaper replacement for the Memorial Hall's old Steinway grand, the piano has a [chequered history](/vol-19/issue-3/oct-dec-2023/chappell-steinway-piano/) and was widely criticised for its tone. It is now a public piano at the National Library Building.
