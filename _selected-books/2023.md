<i>From Keroncong to Xinyao</i> is a captivating exploration of Singapore’s vibrant record industry from the early 20th century to the mid-1980s.

This book presents a fascinating journey through the industry’s triumphs and challenges, charting its resonating contribution to Singapore’s cultural heritage.
