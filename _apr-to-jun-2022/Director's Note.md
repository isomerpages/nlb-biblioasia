One of the pleasures of working in the National Library is that we are located in the Bugis area. There are plenty of shopping and eating options all within walking distance. As you might have guessed, Bugis Street got its name from the Bugis who came to Singapore and settled in the area. But what you may not know is that the Bugis settlement dates back to the 1820s and sprang from a misunderstanding during a royal wedding in Riau. Benjamin J.Q. Khoo’s lively essay takes us back 200 years to a wedding celebration gone terribly wrong that arguably altered the course for Singapore. 

The National Library is also not far from one of the deepest underground places you can publicly access: Bencoolen MRT station. At 43 metres below the surface, this is Singapore’s deepest MRT station. Modern technology allows us to burrow deep but even in the mid-19th century, people were already creating structures below the surface, as Lim Tin Seng uncovers.

This year being the 80th anniversary of the Fall of Singapore, we have two essays about World War II. In the first piece, Janice Loo visits the Kranji War Cemetery and writes movingly about those buried or remembered there. The other essay by Lee Meiyu and Seow Peck Ngiam is in Chinese, and looks at the items relating to the Japanese Occupation period that have been donated to the National Library.

While on the subject of violence, we also have a story by Choo Ruizhi on the acts of terror committed in Singapore by the Communist Party of Malaya. While most people are aware of the Malayan Emergency, and of the tumultuous decade of the 1960s, few remember that the Communist Party was also active in the 1970s. 

On a more peace-led note, don’t miss Kelvin Tan’s essay on how Chinese Buddhist women were behind some of the early iconic vegetarian restaurants in Singapore.

There are also interesting essays on the late forensic pathologist Chao Tzee Cheng by Goh Lee Kim, Chinese and Japanese photo studios in prewar Singapore by Zhuang Wubin, the forgotten history of Sennett Estate by Winnie Tan and the story of how Singapore Airlines took flight as told by Ang Seow Leng.

Plenty to read as usual in this issue so buckle up and enjoy the ride!

PREVIOUSLY

Having worked as a librarian for over 15 years, I have a special place in my heart for books
and, by extension, paper. Paper is an ideal material for conveying knowledge widely: it is
cheap, relatively easy to make and holds ink well. But that doesn’t mean it can’t be improved.

Back in the 1920s, someone came up with the idea of adding a little liquid latex into the
paper-making process to get paper that is stronger, more flexible and more water-resistant.
It was a good idea, at least on paper (pun intended). However, for various reasons, the
product never caught fire. Read our cover story by Alex Teoh to find out [why rubber latex
paper never took off](/vol-18/issue-1/apr-to-jun-2022/rubber-latex-paper).

Around the time when this unique paper was making waves, the Orang Seletar were
literally riding the waves in the strait between Singapore and Johor. They lived on boats
and harvested nature’s bounty back when borders were porous. Ilya Katrinnada speaks to
the [Orang Seletar](/vol-18/issue-1/apr-to-jun-2022/orang-seletar-changing-tides) of today to learn how their life has changed in the last century.

The Orang Laut are unique in being able to live off the land (and sea). Not so for the
rest of us, who rely on supermarkets and wet markets for our produce. Speaking of [wet
markets](/vol-18/issue-1/apr-to-jun-2022/singapore-changing-wet-markets), the term is actually a local one of relatively recent coinage. Up until a few decades
ago, they were simply known as markets. Join Zoe Yeo as she wanders through the aisles
of history and shares some of her interesting finds.

One of the pleasures of the wet market is the flower stall, where you can get inexpensive
flowers. However, while these stalls may offer a wide range, what they will not have
are the orchid hybrids that Singapore presents to VIPs. These hybrids are bred specifically
by the Singapore Botanic Gardens and are not available for sale anywhere. If you are an
orchid lover, don’t miss Rebecca Tan’s essay on the roots of [orchid diplomacy](/vol-18/issue-1/apr-to-jun-2022/singapore-orchid-diplomacy) in Singapore.

In this issue of BiblioAsia, we also delve into a history of the [Padang](/vol-18/issue-1/apr-to-jun-2022/history-padang), peek into the pioneering [Kamala Club](/vol-18/issue-1/apr-to-jun-2022/kamala-club), visit the old [Kandang Kerbau Hospital](/vol-18/issue-1/apr-to-jun-2022/history-kandang-kerbau-hospital), examine the life of [cinema
magnate Tan Cheng Kee](/vol-18/issue-1/apr-to-jun-2022/cinema-pioneer-tan-cheng-kee), explore the streets of [Opera Estate](/vol-18/issue-1/apr-to-jun-2022/history-opera-estate), and sample the unique nature of [Chinese food](/vol-18/issue-1/apr-to-jun-2022/evolution-chinese-food-singapore) in Singapore.

All in all, another issue with plenty to chew on. Bon appétit!
