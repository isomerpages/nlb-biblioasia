Entrepreneurs and members of the public looking for advice on setting up and growing their businesses, as well as information on their personal credit standing, will benefit from the newly-launched advisory services at the National Library.
 
These business and personal credit advisory services are offered by the National Library Board in partnership with DP Bureau Pte Ltd and Credit Bureau Singapore Pte Ltd. These services are available at the 7th floor of the National Library on weekdays, with DP operating from 10 am to 5:30 pm and Credit Bureau from 2 pm to 6 pm respectively.

Educational seminars and workshops by the two partners focusing on topics such as regulatory requirements, business operations and the obligations of company directors are in the pipeline. In addition, members of the public can also obtain tips on healthy credit report maintenance, credit reputation improvement, angel fund support and understand reasons why loan applications are rejected.

This initiative supports the development of vibrant and globally competitive Singaporean enterprises — one of the key directions announced by the Economic Strategies Committee on 1 Feb 2010.
