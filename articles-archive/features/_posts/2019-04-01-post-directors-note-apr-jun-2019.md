April 2019 is a special month for the National Archives of Singapore (NAS). After an 18-month makeover, the NAS building at Canning Rise re-opened on 7 April with a slew of upgraded facilities for the public. As the NAS’ year-long 50th anniversary celebrations that began in June 2018 draw to a conclusion, we will mark its close by hosting the SARBICA* International Symposium from 24–28 June 2019.

This special edition of *BiblioAsia* puts the spotlight on all things archives. In his op-ed, [Dr Shashi Jayakumar](/vol-15/issue-1/apr-jun-2019/lookingbackforward) describes how recent initiatives undertaken by the NAS prepare the organisation – as well as Singapore – for the future. [Eric Chin](/vol-15/issue-1/apr-jun-2019/evidence-in-archives) examines the role of the archives in providing evidence and the value this has for Singapore – from resolving the landmark Pedra Branca dispute to helping bring the past to life for today’s generation.

[Fiona Tan](/vol-15/issue-1/apr-jun-2019/pioneers-of-archives) remembers some of the pioneers who started the archives in Singapore, Mark Wong interviews an archives veteran to glean insights into her 45-year career, and [Abigail Huang](/vol-15/issue-1/apr-jun-2019/building-history) charts the timeline of the archives buildings over the years (we did say this issue is about the archives!). [Cheong Suk-Wai](/vol-15/issue-1/apr-jun-2019/stories-little-people) stresses the importance of oral history records and tells us why the life of a humble tailor matters as much as that of the tycoon.

The Japanese Occupation remains a dark chapter in our history, and three essays touch on this period and its aftermath. [Kwok Kian Woon](/vol-15/issue-1/apr-jun-2019/unresolved-past) reflects on the tragedy of war and why it is important to remember. [Lee Geok Boi](/vol-15/issue-1/apr-jun-2019/wartime-victuals) pieces together oral history interviews to paint a grim picture of hunger and deprivation during those difficult years. The problem didn’t go away when the war ended: the British had to set up children’s feeding centres to address malnutrition, as [Cheryl-Ann Low](/vol-15/issue-1/apr-jun-2019/feeding-the-hungry) discovered.

Other articles elucidate the value of the archives. [Tan Chui Hua](/vol-15/issue-1/apr-jun-2019/disco-fever) puts on her dancing shoes to uncover Singapore’s early disco scene through oral history and newspaper records. [Irene Ng](/vol-15/issue-1/apr-jun-2019/s-rajaratnam), biographer of one of our founding fathers, S. Rajaratnam, ponders the painstaking process of uncovering the life of a person using archival records. [Gretchen Liu](/vol-15/issue-1/apr-jun-2019/the-way-we-were) highlights the work of the Photo Unit, whose contributions comprise the single largest collection of photographs held by the NAS.

We recently published *50 Records from History: Highlights from the National Archives of Singapore*. Three of these items – [a map, a contract and an architectural drawing](/vol-15/issue-1/apr-jun-2019/making-history) – provide a peek into the NAS’ vast collection of 10 million records (and counting).

Since 2012 – when the NAS became part of the National Library Board – the library and the archives have worked together to make our resources more accessible to the public. We hope this issue of *BiblioAsia* will inspire many of you to look deeper into Singapore’s documentary and publishing heritage in this bicentennial year, and gain a new appreciation of our roots.
