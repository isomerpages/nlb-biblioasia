#### The town of Singapore and its architecture had always attracted attention. Even in the earliest days of the Settlement, visitors regularly commented on the fine buildings along the Esplanade, the neat and orderly streets and tree-lined thoroughfares, and the grand colonial-style residences of the European and Asian elites. From the outset, the progress of the town and its architectural landmarks were seen, quite rightly, as a reflection of the colony's prosperity.

This is just as true for today’s Singapore, where the modern city-state is metonymically encapsulated by its cutting-edge architecture, designed by some of the world’s leading architects—I. M. Pei, Kenzo Tange, Kisho Kurkawa, Kevin Roche, Peter Prahn and Zaha Hadid, to name just a few. Inevitably, it is the cluster of tall buildings that constitute the Central Business District—Singapore’s mini-Manhattan—that garners the most attention. There are three favoured viewpoints for photographing this scene. The first looks across the river from the north bank—either from somewhere between the two Parliament Houses, old and new, or else from the top of the Swissotel The Stamford, which offers a splendid bird’s eye view of the metropolis. The second perspective is from a vantage point situated somewhere between the Esplanade Theatres and the ECP Bridge, while the third is from the front of the Marina Bay Sands complex, looking across the waters of Marina Bay towards Collyer Quay. A recent addition to the latter aspect is a view of the city from the skyline swimming pool on top of the casino—an image featuring a botak (bald) swimmer in goggles making waves in the foreground became an instant icon for modern Singapore when it appeared in the press in 2010.

It is this vision of the city as a modern metropolis rising from the waves—or at least over the rim of an infinity pool—that I wish to consider in this essay. Not today’s image, but an earlier version from a period when Singapore first began to flex its financial muscles and emerge as a major player in the global marketplace shortly after the end of the First World War.

In the nineteenth century, it was the view as one approached the town of Singapore from the sea that was especially admired. Frank Marryat, for example, who visited Singapore as a Midshipman in the Royal Navy in the 1840s, writes: “From the anchorage the town of Sincapore \[sic\] has a very pleasing appearance”, adding that “most of the public buildings as well as some of the principal merchants’ houses, face the sea”.1 This much-painted vista of Singapore from the Roads was the ‘face’ of Singapore throughout the nineteenth century and continued to be a defining view of the city right up to the late 1970s when the Marina reclamation scheme filled in the Inner Harbour and put the sea at one remove from the old waterfront.

Around the time that Marryat was writing, the principal focus of attention lay to the north of the Singapore River’s mouth, the locus of Raffles’ original ‘European Town’, with its elegant tropical Palladian architecture by George Coleman, juxtaposed with the soaring spires of the Christian places of worship —St Gregory’s, St Andrew’s and the Cathedral of the Good Shepherd—which were in effect Singapore’s first ‘skyscrapers’.

Gradually, however, the gaze of the onlooker began to shift south of the Singapore River after work began in 1858 on a land reclamation scheme on the seaward side of Raffles Place. The principal undertaking here was the construction of a robust seawall to a design by the eponymous Captain George Chancellor Collyer, Chief Engineer of the Straits Settlements; when this was completed in 1864, it made possible the development of a new commercial waterfront to the south of the Singapore River.

The earliest buildings on Collyer Quay were fairly modest, two-storey affairs; the ground floor comprising an arcaded verandah, or five foot way, with a cantilevered wooden balcony above. In one or two instances, a third storey was added in the form of a tower, or observatory, from the top of which a peon with an eye-glass could scan the horizon for in-coming ships; in those days, if a cargo was unassigned, then whoever managed to meet the vessel first as she came into port, and befriended the captain before he dropped anchor, generally got the business.

Two early buildings of note along this new stretch of harbour front were the General Post Office and Exchange Building, completed in 1878 and 1879 respectively. Although they fronted onto Cavenagh Bridge Road, they were designed to be seen as much from the seaward side as from the land. In 1892, they were joined by a huge Victorian blockbuster, the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank Building, standing at the corner of Battery Road and Collyer Quay—the same site that HSBC occupies to this day. The Bank’s 1892 premises was an architectural tour de force in terms of its polygamous marriage of disparate architectural styles— Renaissance, Baroque, Queen Anne and Gothic, with a Roman portico tacked onto the front by way of an entrance. An early work by engineerarchitects Messrs Archibald Swan and James Waddell Boyd Maclaren, it was, in the view of *The Straits Times*, “the most commanding building…yet erected in Singapore”, and it completed the line-up of waterfront buildings for the nineteenth century.2

There were further additions to the waterfront in the early twentieth century, the three most notable edifices being Winchester House (1904), The Arcade (1909) and St Helen’s Court (1916).3 Winchester House, at four storeys, was arguably Singapore’s first bona fide high-rise building and it was also the first to have an electric lift installed, though not until 1906. With a colonnade of Roman Doric columns in the round at street level, and lots of rustication, quoinsand other Classical detailing above, it certainly stood out from its rather more perfunctory nineteenth-century neighbours, which is no doubt what the owner, Towkay (loosely translated as “boss” in Hokkien) Loke Yew, intended. It was, however, somewhat eclipsed five years later by what was probably the most remarkable building to have graced Singapore’s waterfront, namely The Arcade, an extraordinary Orientalist confection “built according to Arabian and Moorish designs”, with a couple of copper onion domes on top.4 Designed by Scottish architect David McLeod Craik for the Alkaff family, The Arcade comprised a glass-covered walkway, or atrium, which extended from Collyer Quay all the way through to Raffles Place. With rows of shops on each side and a restaurant in the middle, plus two floors of offices above, The Arcade prefigured, on a modest scale, many of today’s shopping complexes. Lastly, there was St Helen’s Court, headquarters of the Asiatic Petroleum Company and the Straits Steamship Company; at five storeys, St Helen’s definitely put both Winchester House and The Arcade in the shade.

These noble edifices aside, the majority of buildings on Collyer Quay up until the end of the First World War were two-storey affairs (with the exception of the odd lookout tower), dating back some 50 years to the completion of Collyer Quay in the late 1860s. As for the new additions, imposing though they were in their way, they were still firmly situated in the nineteenth century; the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank building, just 20 years on from its grand opening, already seemed like an architectural dinosaur from another era.

Then suddenly, in the space of the 10 years that followed the end of the war in Europe in November 1918, we see a complete transformation of the waterfront from a relatively homogenous parade of low-rise nineteenth century godowns (with one or two exceptions) into a glamorous, modern skyline that, architecturally speaking, was situated somewhere between the London Embankment and the Shanghai Bund.

In order to fully appreciate how this came about, we need to understand that Singapore emerged from the First World War in a very strong position on several fronts. The price of Malayan rubber was high, while the tin market, though it had been in recession during the war years, was about to make a brilliant recovery. At the same time, property prices and the construction industry were booming, and shipping was rapidly returning to normal.

Meanwhile, during the war there had been a complete makeover of the dockyards at Keppel Harbour, which now boasted the second-largest graving dock in the world, as well as a greatly extended wharf at the huge new Empire Dock, which had only been completed 1917. Work was also just about to begin on a causeway linking Singapore Island with the Malay Peninsula. Completed in 1923, the Causeway enabled goods and passengers to travel by train all the way from the terminus at Tanjong Pagar to the town of Prai in Province Wellesley, which was the mainland train station for the island of Penang; the ultimate aim, however, was a continuous rail link that would connect the Malay Peninsula, via Burma, with British India.

Strategically, the conflict in Europe had underlined Singapore’s importance in times of war as a regional communications hub for cable and wireless telegraphy, while Singapore’s military significance similarly increased, with Viscount Jellicoe, former First Lord of the Admiralty, describing Singapore as “undoubtedly the key to the Far East”. As well as plans for a massive new naval base, his fact-finding mission to East Asia in 1919 also led to the construction of a Royal Air Force station at Seletar (1927–1928). The latter, though primarily intended to serve a military purpose, also gave Singapore its first proper aerodrome for civil aviation; regular passenger and postal air services were, admittedly, still some way off, but the potential of civil aviation was already recognised in 1919 and it was simply just a matter of time before it became a reality.

In short, as the war in Europe finally drew to a close in 1918, Singapore was extremely well positioned both economically and in terms of her infrastructure to make the most of the resumption of normal trading along with the economic upturn that accompanied it. Although there was a recession looming just around the corner, no one knew about it then.5 Rather, this was a period of optimism and celebration, with the upcoming centenary of the founding of Singapore by Sir Stamford Raffles to look forward to. Sir Raffles’ cherished dream of establishing a “great commercial emporium” in the East was, by then, very much a reality.

It is no coincidence, then, that it is precisely at this point that we see a sudden burst of building activity taking place at Collyer Quay which, in the space of just 10 years, would be completely transformed by the addition of four major new buildings. They were, in order of appearance, the Ocean Building (1922), the Union Building (1924), a new Hongkong and Shanghai Bank Building (1924), and the General Post Office or Fullerton Building (1928).6 These were not just new buildings, but buildings of a kind never seen in Singapore before—huge, corporate blockbusters, built to the latest designs, that gave Singapore its first high-rise skyline, a skyline that before the decade was out would be drawing comparisons with London, Liverpool and Shanghai.

The first of the postwar behemoths to go up on Collyer Quay was the Ocean Building, the new headquarters of the Ocean Steamship Company, more popularly known as the Blue Funnel Line, which had one of the largest fleets operating in the Far East. The design of the Ocean Building is credited to the British engineer Somers Howe Ellis (1871–1954), who was Chief Civil Engineer of the Ocean Steamship Company from 1919 until his retirement in 1939. It was situated at the corner of Collyer Quay and Prince Street—the site occupied by today’s Ocean Building—and replaced an earlier two-storey structure that had been the premises of Blue Funnel’s Singapore agents, Mansfield & Co. The contrast between the new and old could not have been greater. Five storeys in elevation, the main part of the building was a few feet higher than St Helen’s Court, which up until then had been the tallest building by the waterfront, but then there was a 50-foot tower on top that turned the Ocean Building into a veritable ‘skyscraper’ by the standards of the day.

To think that a building of such size and mass could be erected on ground that was far from firm was entirely due to the employment of the latest construction techniques, namely a concrete frame with masonry infill which was then covered over with a layer of artificial stone or ‘cladding’. This method is, of course, standard procedure in today’s architecture, but at the time the Ocean Building was going up, it was still considered innovative and certainly had not been used on this scale in Singapore before. And it wasn’t just the size of the building that astonished people, it was also massive in terms of its composition; that is to say, the size and proportions of the Classical elements and ornamental features that made up its façade were equally monumental in scale.
