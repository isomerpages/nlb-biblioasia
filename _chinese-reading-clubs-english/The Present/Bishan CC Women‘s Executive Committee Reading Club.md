**About**:	The Reading Club operates in partnership with the National Library Board to promote Chinese reading, encourage reading habits, and share the joy of reading. 

*Book Selection* <br>
Our carefully curated book selections encompass diverse topics and genres, with particular emphasis on celebrating and promoting works by local authors. 

*Mission*<br> 
We believe in the transformative power of literature to forge meaningful connections, operating under the principle of "making friends through books" while actively promoting and nurturing local reading culture. 

*Goals and Activities*<br> 
We regularly organise reading sessions that combine discussions with cultural activities (such as Chinese New Year riddles and games) to make reading more lively and interesting.

*Vision*<br> 
Our vision is to create and sustain a warm and vibrant reading community.
