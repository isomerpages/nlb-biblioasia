When I was growing up, my grandfather’s elderly cousin would visit us during important festive occasions. The womenfolk in the family would gather to make steamed rice dumplings or 桃粿 (*tao guo*, literally peach dumplings) to use as prayer offerings. I still remember the booming voice of my grandfather’s cousin as her large palms deftly shaped the pink-hued rice dumplings, pressing them into a wooden mould. Nowadays, no one seems to have the time to gather around the kitchen and cook while chatting in the Teochew dialect. These days, my uncles simply buy the *tao guo*; it just tastes different and part of the fun is gone.[^1] 

During the annual Dragon Boat festival, my grandmother would spend days painstakingly preparing the ingredients required for making the pyramid-shaped rice dumplings called 肉粽 (rou zong). It was a tedious process making them: cooking red beans and grinding them into a paste; boiling dried chestnuts and removing the skins; chopping and stirfrying dried prawns, dried mushrooms and fatty pork with coriander powder and other spices; washing bamboo leaves, strings and glutinous rice; and cleaning caul fat membrane and stuffing it with a generous dollop of the red bean paste. The ingredients were then assembled and neatly wrapped in bamboo leaves before being steamed to perfection in bamboo baskets. Nowadays, many families prefer to purchase ready-made dumplings from shops.

In recent years, there has been no lack of news lamenting the closure of many Singapore food establishments. Most recently, in May 2013—after 58 years of operation—the shutters came down on the iconic Mong Hing Teochew Restaurant in Beach Road. Exhausting and time-consuming food preparation, ageing cooks, the lack of successors, and the rising cost of manpower and ingredients are frequently cited as reasons for these closures. 

This essay examines the ethnological aspect of food and its impact on the food my grandparents, parents and my family have consumed over the decades and offers perspectives on how our family’s eating habits have evolved over the course of three generations.


#### **My Grandparents'  Generation: 1930s–1950s**
My maternal grandmother arrived in Singapore from Guandong province in China during the late 1930s. As a young bride, she lived with her husband and mother-in-law who were farmers. Life settled into a routine of waking up before dawn to feed the pigs and chickens,tending to the vegetable plots, and cooking three meals a day. My great grandmother would harvest the vegetables and sell them at a nearby makeshift market.

Breakfast was usually a bowl of steaming watery porridge served with some fried eggs and preserved olives; lunch comprised stir-fried vegetables and pork; while dinner was more stir-fried vegetables, along with fried or steamed fish. This was the typical fare of my grandmother’s generation. My paternal grandparents were fortunate enough to live along the banks bordering the Straits of Johor (on the Singapore side), where they enjoyed easy access to fresh seafood. As a result, freshly steamed fish and seafood, seasoned simply with salt, featured frequently at mealtimes. One of our relatives made her homemade fish sauce as a seasoning, and it was also common for families to ferment their own rice wine for cooking. In those days, sumptuous dishes that required elaborate preparation or expensive and seasonal ingredients were only eaten during festivals and celebrations.

In Singapore, my maternal grandmother was exposed to new forms of cuisine as well as cultures. When she saw her first bowl of chendol, she thought it was disgusting how people could wolf down green worms swimming in a pool of dirty brown water. She later realised that those “worms” were actually strips of jelly made from rice flour mixed with the juice of the fragrant pandan (screwpine) leaf and green food colouring, and the liquid they were floating in was a delicious concoction of coconut milk and gula melaka (palm sugar).

According to Saw Swee Hock, a professorial fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, there was a fourfold increase in Singapore’s population from 226,842 in 1901 to 938,144 in 1947. The growth rate gathered slight momentum after a lull period in the late 19th century, showing a 3 percent increase between 1901 and 1911 and a 3.3 percent increase between 1911 and 1921. During the Great Depression, however, there was a drop of 2.9 percent due to restrictions imposed on immigrants from China and India. However, between 1931 and 1947, the growth rate rebounded to 3.2 percent.1 My grandparents were part of this final wave of immigrants.

Neville wrote that during the postwar period, the Chinese population dominated the influx of new immigrants and several dialect groups lived in enclaves, particularly within the central city area. The Teochew community established themselves mainly on the south bank of the Singapore River. Many were employed as coolies (labourers), hauling goods between the riverside warehouses and tongkangs (local wooden boats) crowding the river. Some Teochews specialised in certain sectors of the interisland boat trade, particularly between Singapore, west Borneo and southThailand where substantial Teochew trading communities were found.2 There were also others, like my grandparents and relatives, who were farmers and fishermen living in Teochew-dominated areas of Singapore like Sembawang, Upper Thomson and Punggol.

From the immediate postwar years up till the late 1960s, my grandparents lived in close proximity to their extended families and ate more or less the same meals every day. During festive seasons, food and invitations to more elaborate feasts were exchanged. Occasionally they would have their meals at makeshift stalls set up by streetside hawkers, choosing cooked food they were accustomed to. As unemployment rates in newly independent Singapore was high and jobs were scarce, many people chose to become hawkers; it was definitely one of the easier ways to earn a living during those difficult times.

According to the 1950 Hawker Inquiry Commission Report, Cantonese, Teochew and Hokkien hawkers made up the largest percentage of hawkers at 30, 30 and 20 percent respectively.3 However, in the post-war years, itinerant hawkers were seen as a general nuisance to the public, obstructing roads, incessantly calling out to customers, creating trouble with their gang affiliations, and posing a serious threat to health with their unhygienic food preparation and storage. Still, there was a demand as these hawkers provided their customers with easy access to reasonably priced cooked food, and it was a means of livelihood for themselves. The problem, however, was one of legislation. The report found that only between a quarter and a third of the hawkers were licensed, while the “remainder \[were\] breaking the law everyday merely in the course of earning their living.”4

#### **My Parent’s Generation: Post-independence Singapore**

After Singapore’s independence in 1965, a series of broad and sweeping changes were made by the government across all sectors, many of which were felt by the masses from the 1970s to the 1990s. The Housing Development Board (HDB) was set up in 1960 and in the decades that followed, more and more families were resettled from kampongs (villages) to public housing blocks. Communal cooking activities were no longer possible as kitchens shrank in size, families became smaller and their relatives and friends were scattered all over Singapore. As more women became educated and joined the workforce, they also became less inclined to spend time on domestic affairs.

As a young wife in the 1970s, my mother enjoyed collecting recipes from newspapers and magazines, attending cooking classes at community centres, watching cooking programmes on television and buying cookbooks. My mother was able to try her hand at cooking dishes from cuisines other than Teochew and, thanks to new kitchen equipment, such as the refrigerator, gas stove, cake mixer and blender, was able to reduce the time she spent in the kitchen preparing ingredients and cooking. The introduction of supermarkets also widened the selection of ingredients available; and imported items started making their way to the supermarket shelves.

Over time, all this had a huge impact on what we ate. Our hot porridge breakfasts gave way to the more convenient combination of bread, butter and jam, and our mealtimes saw more variety on the table as Mum grew adventurous and experimented with new dishes. However, during important festivals and celebrations, we would still indulge in grandmother’s and mother’s traditional Teochew cooking. The success of the Speak Mandarin campaign, which was introduced in 1979, eroded our ability to converse in fluent Teochew. Today, my siblings and I are less well-versed in the Teochew dialect, and as a result, cooking instructions issued to us in this Chinese dialect by our grandmother are sometimes lost in translation. Occasionally, grandmother would share Teochew food aphorisms such as 三四桃李奈 and 七八 油甘柿 (meaning “peaches, apricots and plums ripen during March and April” and “Indian gooseberries and persimmons are ready to be eaten in July and August”) and dispense practical advice such as 稚鸡,
