Since it was established about two decades ago, the Asian Film Archive (AFA) has restored many films connected to Singapore. These include classic titles from the golden age of Malay cinema such as K.M. Basker’s _Patah Hati_ (1952) and Hussein Haniff’s _Dang Anom_ (1962) to more recent Singapore movies like _Mee Pok Man_ (1995) and _Money No Enough_ (1998). However, as the name of the organisation implies, the AFA has also been active in restoring films from around the region. In 2005, when the archive was founded, director Mike De Leon became the first Filipino filmmaker to donate his works to the AFA for preservation.

An eminent filmmaker of the second golden age of Philippine cinema from the 1970s to early 1980s, De Leon’s films arrived at the AFA in a variety of film formats that included 35 mm original picture and sound negatives, and De Leon’s own collection of surviving 35 mm exhibition prints.

#### **Assembling the Embassy**

In 2014, ABS-CBN Corporation, the largest media conglomerate of the Philippines, embarked on the first restorations of De Leon’s filmography beginning with _Hindi Nahahati ang Langit_ (_An Indivisible Heaven_, 1985) – about two stepsiblings who fall in love – using the negative it acquired. In 2015, ABS-CBN loaned from the AFA the 35 mm original camera and sound negatives of De Leon’s 1980 musical comedy _Kakabakaba Ka Ba_? (_Will Your Heart Beat Faster?_) and subsequently the surviving 35 mm release prints of the 1979 _Kung Mangarap Ka't Magising_ (_Moments in a Stolen Dream_), a coming-of-age romantic drama, for digitisation and restoration.&nbsp;

Both films were produced by LVN Pictures, one of the biggest film studios of Philippine cinema since its inception in 1938. The LVN studio ceased operations in 2005, and ABS-CBN Corporation acquired the assets to maintain the legacy of LVN Pictures and the films it made. The rights to De Leon’s other works belonged to either the director or multiple parties.

Considering and navigating the legal and copyright issues are essential in preparing for any film restoration. With the approval and support from the film’s executive producer Marichu Vera-Perez Maceda in 2016, the AFA assessed and determined the urgency to digitise and restore De Leon’s 1982 critically acclaimed _Alpha Kappa Omega Batch ’81_ (also known as _Batch ’81_ or _ΑΚΩ 81_).
