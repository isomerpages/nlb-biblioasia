Over a year ago, as part of the lead-up to the first International Summit of the Book in 2012, the Library of Congress embarked on a project to create a list of books, principally titles written by Americans that have shaped America in various crucial ways. The list was intended to spark a national conversation on books that have influenced American lives and society, whether they appeared on this initial list or not. This project was inspired by work the British Museum did a few years ago to identify 100 objects that shaped the world.

For our project, Library of Congress curators identified the books and displayed copies of them in an exhibition. Our list of “Books That Shaped America” generated tremendous reactions from all around the country. People weighed in, as we had hoped, and took part in a discussion of the works that were on our list as well as books that were not on our list that they felt ought to be. Through our website, we invited people to send us their comments, including nominations of books that they felt should be on the list. This generated thousands of responses and persuaded us to make additions to the list, which now totals 100 books.

Beyond shaping America, books have created civilisation in a very real sense. When one goes from scrolls to codexes, books with bound pages with a table of contents and an index, it is possible to use the latter as an introduction to critical thought. It represents a whole new phase that first began with the manuscript way back in the fourth century.

#### **Books that have shaped us**

What we might call the founding books of civilisation are in many ways the books of the great religions. These include the Christian Bible, much of which is based on the Jewish Bible. Then there is the Koran, the last of the great prophetic, monotheistic books. The Chinese and the Indian traditions are also part of the basis of world civilisation. There is the Chinese *Book of Lessons* that contains Confucius’ *Analects*, which was the basis of education in China, and also the basis for the civil service exams taken by Chinese officials for a thousand years. India produced the *Ramayana and Mahabharata*, the two great Hindu epics and fundamental doctrines originally published in Sanskrit and translated into the many languages of the Indian subcontinent. These great epic poems, in a way, were the basis of much of Hinduism. Also to be considered is either of Saint Augustine’s books, *The Confessions of Saint Augustine or The City of God*, which were the basis of medieval thought and the whole concept of another spiritual world. These are all examples of great founding documents of civilisation.

The great founding epics of the Western tradition, Homer’s *Iliad* and *Odyssey*, which are almost as old as the oldest Indian and Chinese works, are not to be forgotten. The first work on actual history is *The History of the Peloponnesian War* by Thucydides. I remember, as an undergraduate in college, hearing former Secretary of State General George C. Marshall give a speech, just before he announced the Marshall Plan (officially known as the European Recovery Programme, which lasted from 1948 to 1951), saying he had been reading the aforementioned book and that it gave him guidance about the post-war world. Thus, that work of founding importance in Western history retains its importance even today.


In terms of philosophy, one must consider Aristotle’s work. It was the basis of the theology of the Latin Church, which penetrated from Greece into the Islamic world, then into the Christian world and Jewish thought. All kinds of secular thought, and even early governmental thinking in the West, had its roots in the philosophical works of Aristotle. If I had to choose a particular work of Aristotle as being especially influential, I would select the edition of his work that was published in Venice in the early modern period.

When considering the founding books of civilisation, the rise of science must be taken into account. For example, there are the fundamental works of Copernicus, but perhaps the most important of all, in the history of science, are the principles of natural philosophy by Isaac Newton, who gave us the law of gravity and so much else.

In terms of social science, one has to go to the Muslim world and Ibn Khaldun. Ibn Khaldun was born in what is now southern Spain and ended up being a founding figure in the northern African world. His *Prolegomena* and his longer seven volumes that were associated with it are really the first world history. He wrote a history that was also a treatise on sociology, geology and an analysis of the movement from rurals to cities. He was the first great world historian. Arnold Toynbee said Khaldun was the greatest world historian of all, but alas he is not very well known. When I was teaching world history, I always began with a reading of *Prolegomena* and students were astonished that anyone could write that way in the 14th century.
