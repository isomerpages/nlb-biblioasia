#### From the first smallpox vaccine introduced in 1819 to the nationwide Covid-19 vaccination programme now underway, **Ong Eng Chuan** provides a quick history of vaccination efforts in Singapore since colonial times.

The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has cast vaccination into the spotlight as it helps to prevent the disease and reduce its spread. Being vaccinated is not a new concept in Singapore though. Most children here routinely get vaccinated against diseases such as measles and mumps.

Vaccinations for children are done under National Childhood Immunisation Schedule which is overseen by the Ministry of Health (MOH). It covers diseases such as tuberculosis, diphtheria, hepatitis B, measles, pertussis (whooping cough), pneumococcal infection, poliomyelitis, rubella (German measles) and tetanus. It does not stop with children either. Many adults take the influenza (flu) vaccine, especially before travelling to colder climates, as well as the pneumococcal and hepatitis B vaccines. The elderly and people with certain chronic conditions are strongly advised to have the flu jab regularly.

The highly organised way in which the Health Ministry handles the schedule for childhood vaccinations makes it seems like a very modern medical practice. However, vaccinations in Singapore actually have a long history. The very first vaccine – for smallpox – was introduced as early as December 1819.

##### **Smallpox and Vaccination in Early Singapore**
Until fairly recently, smallpox, which is caused by the variola virus, was a much-feared disease. It was highly contagious, had a high mortality rate and those who survived were often disfigured for life. Thanks to a concerted global campaign of vaccination, smallpox was eventually eradicated, and in October 1979, the World Health Organization (WHO) finally declared the world free of the disease.[^1] 

The first step towards eradicating smallpox began in 1796 when English doctor Edward Jenner used cowpox (a milder form of smallpox) to induce immunity against the more virulent smallpox.[^2] This smallpox vaccine was the first vaccine to be introduced in Singapore. 

In December 1819, Resident of Singapore William Farquhar wrote to officials in Penang to request for supplies of smallpox vaccine.[^3]  The vaccine was sent to Singapore and a Vaccine Department set up to administer the vaccination. However, this early attempt at a vaccination programme failed, and the Vaccine Department was abolished in 1829. Subsequent efforts also produced erratic outcomes and as a result, smallpox remained prevalent in Singapore, periodically breaking out into epidemic proportions, such as the 1838 episode which claimed hundreds of lives.[^4]  

These early vaccination programmes faltered due to the resistance from the local population.[^5]  Few residents came forth to be vaccinated and parents were also unwilling to send their healthy children to be vaccinated for fear of putting them at risk.

In its early form, vaccination was done using arm-to-arm transfer, getting pustular material from one vaccinated person to directly inoculate another person by scratching the material into the recipient’s arm.[^6]  This method needed a constant stream of people to help propagate the vaccine.

It was hard to obtain fresh vaccine lymph or material when the supply ran out. As Penang and Singapore did not produce the smallpox vaccine, fresh material had to be shipped from Calcutta.[^7]  However, the tropical climate made it difficult to maintain the shelf life of the vaccine so by the time the vaccines arrived here, their effectiveness would be compromised. 

The authorities made attempts to obtain vaccine lymph from other sources such as Batavia (now Jakarta) and the Royal Jennerian Institute in London (which would take six weeks to reach Singapore by ship), in the hope that these would give better results.[^8] 

In 1863, when the incidence of smallpox increased again, the government was urged to implement tougher measures, including making smallpox vaccination compulsory by law, following in the footsteps of the Dutch who had successfully introduced compulsory vaccination in the Dutch East Indies (present-day Indonesia).[^9] 

Stricter public health control measures were finally introduced after the Straits Settlements became a Crown Colony in 1867. The Quarantine Ordinance was passed by the Legislative Council in June 1868, followed by An Ordinance to Extend and Make Compulsory the Practice of Vaccination, which came into effect on 1 May 1869.[^10] 

The latter legislation led to the Ordinance for Registration of Births and Deaths of 1868. A register was necessary to keep track of the number of children to be vaccinated, and it was the responsibility of the Registrar to send notification to parents of newborns to vaccinate their children. It was also important to track deaths and their causes to gauge the success of the vaccination programme.[^11]

Smallpox continued to be a problem in Singapore up until the 1950s. After WHO declared the virus eradicated, Singapore amended the law so that from smallpox vaccination would no longer be required by law from March 1982.[^12]

##### **BCG and the Battle Against Tuberculosis**
At the end of World War II, Singapore found itself in another battle, this time against tuberculosis (TB). TB is an infectious disease caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria. There are two types of TB infections – latent TB infection and TB disease. People with the former show no symptoms and cannot spread the bacteria to others whereas people with the TB disease may spread the bacteria to others. If left untreated, TB can be fatal.13 
In the aftermath of the Japanese Occupation (1942–45), the incidence of tuberculosis increased sharply, especially among young children. It was the number one killer disease right up to the 1960s.14
The anti-tuberculosis vaccine, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), had been developed by French scientists, Albert Calmette and Camille Guérin, in 1919. However, the vaccine only gained wider acceptance after studies began to appear in the 1940s providing evidence of its efficacy.15 
The first large-scale BCG vaccination in Singapore was not carried out by government health authorities though. Instead, it was conducted by the Singapore Anti-Tuberculosis Association (SATA), a charity organisation. The idea of forming an organisation to fight TB had originated from a group of prisoners-of-war interned at Changi Prison and Sime Road Camp during the Japanese Occupation. Eventually, a group of doctors and philanthropists banded together to form SATA in 1947.16
While government health officials were still reviewing the BCG vaccine, SATA, under its first medical director, G.H. Garlick, believed that providing children with protection against TB was an urgent task which could not wait.[^17]

After obtaining a small consignment of the BCG vaccine from the Pasteur Institute in Paris, SATA launched its immunisation programme on 28 June 1949, with the vaccination of 21 children.[^18] As new consignments of the vaccine began to arrive more regularly, SATA ramped up its vaccination drive.[^19]

Two years later, the government’s pilot BCG vaccination programme under the auspices of the United Nations International Children Emergency Fund (UNICEF) began. A UNICEF team started conducting tests on pupils of the Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus at Bras Basah Road in June 1951, with the aim of eventually vaccinating the majority of the 130,000 school children in Singapore within four months. That same year, inoculations of newborns began but these were discontinued in 1952 due to the “lack of staff to do follow-up work”.[^20] 

By 1956, the Singapore government realised that administering the BCG vaccine to children at school entrance age was too late as statistics showed that many children had been infected even before starting school. In December that year, the Health Ministry announced that all babies in Singapore would be given the BCG vaccine soon after birth. SATA’s Garlick approved. “The younger a child is inoculated the better,” he said. “T.B. is so rife here that many children become infected at a very early age.”[^21]

By 1972, after a period of 16 years, over one million vaccinations had been performed. It was estimated that more than 90 percent of infants and primary school students, and 75 percent of secondary school students had been inoculated against TB by 1972.[^22]

Students used to get booster jabs at age 12 or 16 but from 2001, this was discontinued as there was no scientific evidence that this was effective.[^23]

TB remains a global public threat and is still endemic in Singapore, with a higher proportion of the elderly contracting the disease. In 2020, there were 1,370 new cases of active TB among Singapore residents, slightly lower than the 1,398 cases in 2019.
