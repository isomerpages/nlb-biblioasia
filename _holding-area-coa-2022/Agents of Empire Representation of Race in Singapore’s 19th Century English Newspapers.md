#### **Introduction**

Singapore’s first newspaper, the  <i> Singapore Chronicle </i> , was published a mere five years after Stamford Raffles stepped ashore in 1819.1 Soon, the printed word took such a hold of the public mind that busy merchants in Commercial Square (now Raffles Place) were spending a half hour daily discussing the news, including commodity prices and the arrival and departure of cargo-laden ships.2

A plethora of newspapers were launched during the 19th century, though most sank rather quickly. Some, like the <i>Singapore Free Press</i>, survived well into the 20th century, while the <i>Straits Times</i> is in circulation to this day. Virtually all newspapers then perpetuated ideas of race, civilisation, progress and development that subordinated the native and immigrant populations to white colonisers. This essay will show how they did so, by drawing examples from local English-language newspapers across a quarter of a century – from 1875, when Singapore was still a young Crown Colony following its administrative reconstitution into the Straits Settlements, to
the close of the century. The newspapers propped up the imperial edifice,
alongside weapons, books, art and other modes of knowledge production
that have been so extensively studied by scholars of postcolonialism.


#### **The Sociopolitical Context – Global and Local**
By the mid-19th century, the tentacles of British imperialism had reached
into the farthest expanses of Asia and Africa through coercion, deception
and collaboration with local elites. The brutal suppression of the 1857 revolt
in India had been followed by the passing of power into the hands of the
Crown under Queen Victoria. The 258-year-old East India Company was
out, and the Age of Empire officially dawned. This puzzled the British. How
could an island of 17 million establish sovereignty over territories thousands
of miles away and many times greater in size and population? The English
historian John Robert Seeley captured this sense of disbelief, writing in 1883:
“We seem, as it were, to have conquered and peopled half the world in a fit
of absence of mind.”3
There was no dearth of (pseudo) scientific theories to explain the
impossible. Most of these coalesced under social Darwinism. Seizing upon
Darwin’s 1838 theory of biological evolution, academics like Herbert Spencer
quickly concocted its social counterpart, i.e., survival among individuals
competing for limited resources. And given that Europeans in general and
the English in particular were winning the competition, the academics
concluded that the European civilisation was the apex of human evolution,
with others – Hindu, Islamic, Chinese, African, Malay – competing for a
distant second place.4

Singapore had its fair share of colonial administrators who subscribed
to these ideas. Raffles himself, until so recently considered a progressive
administrator, believed in a metaphorical racial ladder, the highest rungs of
which were occupied by Europeans, followed by those natives who adopted
Western modes of behaviour, lifestyle and clothing.5

Four decades after leaving Singapore, its second Resident, the inveterate
traveller and writer John Crawfurd, observed:

     In understanding, in judgment, in taste, in invention, in reach

     of imagination, in enterprise, in perseverance, and in the

     moral sense, the European, placed under equally favourable

     conditions, is greatly superior to the Asiatic.6

Sir Frederick Weld, Governor of the Straits Settlements (1880–87),
echoed similar sentiments: “I think that capacity for governing is a
characteristic of our race, and it is wonderful to see in a country like the
Straits.”7 The Chinese, in Weld’s estimation, depended on the British to look
after them much as “a groom looks after a horse”, and the Malays were in
awe of British probity even in the face of the most alluring 
temptations.8

In the second half of the 19th century, both the opening of the Suez
Canal and the long-distance steamship’s increasing dominance of the ocean
enabled “scientific” theories concocted in London to quickly make their way
to the empire’s outposts, while observations made in far-flung places like
Malaya travelled swiftly to the metropole. This created a circle of knowledge
that endlessly reproduced the same ideas, tropes and stereotypes until they
took on the veneer of truth.

One of the more obvious ways in which newspapers perpetuated
racial hierarchies was by giving voice to new-fangled theories and books.
In December 1853, for example, the <i>Singapore Free Press and Mercantile
Advertiser</i> published a report on a phrenology lecture given by a Mr Sargent
to a “numerous audience”; decades later, the <i>Mid-Day Herald</i> excitedly
announced the arrival of Mrs Josepha North, a sculptor turned renowned
phrenologist, on the island’s shores.9 Phrenology, a now discredited science, claimed a relationship between various races’ skull shapes and intelligence,
and the race it deemed the most intelligent was obvious.

Occasionally, the  <i> Free Press </i>  printed chapters from new books in
serialised form. One chapter titled “The Chinese Towkay” from a book
called  <i> People in a Native State </i> , published on 2 December 1893, is illustrative:

     Many Towkays I know are perfectly at home with a knife and

     fork, indeed some of them give capital dinners. As they have

     educated themselves so far towards civilized society, it is to be

     hoped that they will continue to progress and thereby in time

     cultivate a correct palate for champagne and other wines, so

     that “Comet” and other wonderful but undrinkable beverages

     may no longer adorn (?) their hospitable tables.10

But the newspapers’ role extended beyond mere conduits of information;
they must be situated within a suitable theoretical framework.
