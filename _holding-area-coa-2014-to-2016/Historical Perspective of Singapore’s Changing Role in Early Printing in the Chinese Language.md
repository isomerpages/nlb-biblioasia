#### **Introduction**
From its founding in 1819, modern Singapore has been a multiracial and
multilingual society. The earliest materials printed in Singapore were in
languages such as English, Siamese, Malay, Arabic and Chinese. This
study focuses on early printing in the Chinese language, Singapore’s role
in this development and the impact it made on the Chinese language and
Chinese communities.

This essay starts with a survey of what was published during the 19th
century, followed by a review of what has been studied so far. Based on
these, I examine the changing role of Singapore as a society that enabled
early printing in the Chinese language to take shape, and how this early
availability of printing in the Chinese language impacted the multiracial
and multicultural society.


#### **What Was Published: Output From Early Printing in the Chinese Language**
Due to historical and environmental factors, Singapore’s early efforts
in Chinese-language printing were not well preserved. Despite the
introduction of *The Book Registration Ordinance*, 1886, the situation did not improve, as observed by Cecil Byrd in 1970 when he visited Singapore.
He conducted a survey of early printing in the Straits Settlements, which
was a preliminary exploration of the nascent print industries in the
three settlements.1 Since then, a lot of effort – by local and international
academics, librarians and curators – has been put into compiling a set
of documentation. They have worked to source for samples, including
unrecorded extant titles, so that we now have a better picture of the total
output of such prints.

This study will attempt to compile a list of known titles held by libraries
and archives, listed in special bibliographies and catalogues, as well as
cited by researchers in their dissertations, theses, papers and articles. The
listing will also be supplemented by searching the Online Public Access
Catalogues (OPA C) of the National Library Board (NL B), National
University of Singapore Libraries (NUS Libraries), British Library (BL)
and other libraries specialising in East and Southeast Asian studies.
The resultant listings have been appended as: *Appendix I: A chronology of
printing in the Chinese language, 1825–1902; and Appendix II: A chronology
of printing in romanised Malay and English produced by Straits Chinese,
1889–1902*.

A total of 143 uniform titles were identified as samples of early printing in
the Chinese language, as well as those in romanised Malay and English
produced by the Straits Chinese during the period from 1825 to 1902. The
inclusion of the latter category of printing is due to the fact that they were
works translated from Chinese classics, or written by Chinese and printed or
published by the Chinese press. Together, these constitute the documentary
heritage of the Chinese community in Singapore.

#### **What Has Been Studied: Literature Review**
Studies of early printing efforts in Singapore in the Chinese language
started with Chinese newspapers that emerged only in the second half of
the 19th century. As early as 1927, China-based journalist Ge Gongzhen (戈公振) mentioned in his three-volume work *History of Chinese Newspaper
Press* (《中国报学史》) that the significance of publications such as Malacca’s
first Chinese periodical, *Chinese Monthly Magazine* (《察世俗每月统记传》), and
Singapore’s first Chinese-language magazine, *East-West Magazine* (《东西洋考每
月统记传》), was their contributions to the development of the modern Chinese
press in China.2

Ge also made a special trip to London to read the two magazines and
subsequently wrote an article about them.3 His initial attempt to chronicle
Chinese-language printing may have prompted the first academic study
of early Chinese newspapers by Singaporean Chen Mong Hock. Her MA
thesis, *The Early Chinese Newspapers of Singapore*, 1881–1912 (Singapore:
University of Malayan Press, 1967), remains one of the most authoritative
studies on this subject to this day. Following Chen, a few local and foreign
academics, including He Shumin (何舒敏, 1977),4 David Chng (莊钦永, 1982),5
Wong Hong Ting (王慷鼎, 1982),6 Wu Qing Tang (吴庆棠, 1997),7 and Zhuo
Nan Sheng (卓南生, 1998),8 also added new findings to these studies.

During the first half of the 19th century, the printing and publishing scene
in Singapore was very active. Soon after Sir Stamford Raffles had founded Singapore and established it as a modern and free entrepôt centre linking
Southeast Asia to the rest of the world, Protestant missionaries from the
London Missionary Society (LMS ) and American Board of Commissioners
Foreign Mission (ABCFM) made Singapore a printing centre for both
religious tracts and secular material during the same period. A significant
number of Chinese-language prints that made a great impact in the region,
as well as in China, were produced during this period.

However, as LMS and ABCFM were not based in Singapore, their archives
and library collections were not easily accessible for consultation, and the
study of the missionary press and their printing and publishing activities
during this period inevitably became difficult to achieve.

As such, it is unsurprising that the study of the missionary press and its
printing activities was not feasible until 1960, when ABCFM donated their
library materials to Harvard University, and their archives to the Houghton
Rare Book Library in the U.S.9 Since then, John King Fairbank, Susan
Barnett and the Harvard University group have embarked on a series of
studies into the Protestant missionaries’ legacy concerning the spread of
Christianity and their role in China’s modernisation.10 Cross-cultural
communications by the western Protestants and their Chinese respondents
subsequently became the main subject of study.

In 1985, the Harvard group published an inaugural selection of papers
from a conference held at Harvard University in August 1978. The volume,
entitled *Christianity in China: Early Protestant Missionary Writings*, explored
what the Protestant pioneers of the 19th century wrote in Chinese for their
target audiences.11

Following the precedence of ABCFM, LMS donated their archives and
collections to the School of Oriental & African Studies Library at the University of London in 1973.12 Studies, such as the one on the Anglo-
Chinese College of Malacca by Brian Harrison (1979),13 the London
Missionary Society by Leona O’Sullivan (1984),14 and *The Printing Presses of
the London Missionary Society Among the Chinese* by Ching Su (1996), as well
as a series of books on LMS and early printing in Malacca, Singapore and in
China were made possible by this donation.15

In China, studies on early printing in the Chinese language focused
mostly on the missionary-driven Chinese press, the two early Chinese
magazines (Malacca’s first Chinese periodical *Chinese Monthly Magazine*
and Singapore’s first Chinese-language magazine *East-West Magazine*)
and cross-cultural communication between East and West. These studies
were conducted by two important groups: one at Zhejiang University, led
by Huang Shijian (黄时鉴), and another at Fudan University, led by Zhou
Zhen He (周振鹤) and Zou Zhen Huan (邹振环).16 They published a series of
reprints of primary sources, research articles and monographs featuring the
topics mentioned earlier.

In 2006, David Chng completed his PhD dissertation and presented a
comprehensive study on Chinese printing and publishing by LMS and
ABCFM in the first half of the 19th century in Malacca and Singapore.
His work was inspired by the pioneer Protestants who had been stationed
in Southeast Asia and China in the years before the First Opium War
(1839–1842). The coverage of topics such as the political conflict between
the Qing and British governments that led the two missionary societies
to set up Chinese printing presses in the Malayan peninsula, as well
as the workings of both presses (financial sources, printing processes,
number of titles published, print runs, etc.) gave context to the origins of
the publications.

Chng’s thesis also examined the distribution network of publications,
with an in-depth analysis of the impact these publications had on the
Chinese scholars who read them. His thesis also examined the linguistic
contributions of the missionaries to the modern Chinese lexicon, and the
significance of these publications in the history of thought in modern
China. As such, Chng’s work covers almost all the important findings by
earlier researchers in this field (as of 2006) and provides more concrete
source evidence to prove his points.

Besides his dissertation, Chng also published a series of papers on
missionary novels in the Chinese language,17 a relatively new discipline of
study (started by Patrick Hanan (2000)18 of Harvard University) in relation
to early Protestant missionary writing.

Chen Song-Chuan, formerly an assistant professor of history at Nanyang
Technological University, Singapore, recently produced a study exploring
the efforts and impact of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge
in China (SDK , 1834–1839), the publisher for the majority of secular material
printed by the American Mission Press based in Singapore in the five years
before the First Opium War.

In summary, there has been a lot of focus on early printing in the Chinese
language in Singapore in the first half of the 19th century, but works
published in the second half of the century, besides Chinese newspapers,
have, for the most part, been neglected. Studies have been largely limited
to Protestant missionary works before the First Opium War, and none
paid sufficient attention to the role of Singapore in this publication legacy.
Moreover, many of their studies do not include printing activities after the
decline of missionary presses in Singapore.

While Ching and Chng’s dissertations both acknowledge the role of
Singapore in the early printings by the Protestants before the First Opium
War, the scopes of their studies do not go beyond that of the Protestants’
works – Chen focused his attention on the “information war” waged by the
SDK based in Guangzhou, and did not take Singapore’s supporting role in the “war” into serious consideration. Hence, there is a need to go beyond
existing research and examine the changing role of Singapore as a place of
Chinese publications during the entire 19th century.


#### **Singapore as a Centre of Printing and Publishing of Chinese Materials Outside China (1825–1846)**

Failing to establish a missionary enterprise among the Chinese in
Guangdong, Robert Morrison (1782–1834) of the LMS turned his attention
to Southeast Asia while waiting for an opportune time to return to a more
open and welcoming China. Between 1815 and 1819, LMS established
missions in Malacca, Penang, Batavia and Singapore.19 In 1815, William
Milne founded the Malaccan mission and started printing Chinese Monthly Magazine, the first Chinese magazine published outside of China, which
had a great impact on the emergence of modern Chinese magazines in
mainland China.20
