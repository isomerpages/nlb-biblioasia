The early Indian Muslims who settled in Singapore in the 1800s brought with them a varied heritage: their skills as shopkeepers 
and office workers, their unique customs and beliefs, and a tradition of devout poetry.1 Indeed, their religious faith was a key source of solace for these transplanted Muslims from the southern part of India, who often expressed their piety in the form of verse. One particularly notable poet among them 
was Muhammad Abdul Kadir Pulavar, whose Islamic religious poetry collection, *Munajathu Thirattu*, is the oldest Tamil book held by the National Library.

Published by J. Paton, Government Printer, in 1872, the book comprises a total of 55 poems and songs in praise of Muslim 
saints and the Prophet Muhammad. The verses are written in simple Tamil, richly overlaid with Persian and Arabic words, 
and are appended with tunes and rhythms. They are divided into six genres: introductory poems in praise of the author (four poems); *Munajathu Pathikam* (four songs); *Thanippaakkal* (12 poems); *Thanippathangal* (30 songs); *Sindhu*, a lyrical form of Tamil (two poems); and *Chitirak Kavi*, graphical poems in which 
the letters are drawn in such a way that they resemble the shape of snakes, chariots and other pictographs (three poems).

The collection takes its name from the Arabic word *munajat* – meaning a private and intimate talk with Allah – which is derived 
from the terms *yunaji* or *najawa*, meaning “talking in secret”. The word *najawa* in turn has its roots in *najah*, which means “deliverance” or “salvation”. Hence, the book’s title conveys the meaning of “supplication for the repentance of sins”. Its poems glorify God and offer humble prayers in the form of simple but expressive verses.2

Among them is a song written in praise of Sikkandar Sahib Oli, better known as Sultan Iskandar Shah, who is believed to be the 
last of five kings to rule over 14th-century Singapore. A descendent of Sang Nila Utama (the legendary founder of Singapore who predates Stamford Raffles), Iskandar Shah 
is supposedly buried in a terrace on the northern side of Fort Canning, a spot which has since become a holy place of worship.3 

*Munajathu Thirattu* is also noteworthy as evidence of the island’s tolerant multiracial character from as early as the 1800s. 
Although this is an Islamic religious poetry
