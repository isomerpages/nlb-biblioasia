Inspired by the National Library Singapore’s exhibition of the same name that was launched in 2017, *Tales of the Malay World* features more than 60 rare early manuscripts and lithographed books from centuries past, at a time when Malay was the dominant language of trade, diplomacy, religious discourse and literature in maritime Southeast Asia.

This volume presents nearly 400 advertisements – from the 1830s to 1960s – from the collection of the National Library, Singapore. They are selected from a variety of print materials, including newspapers, books, periodicals and ephemera. Written by our own librarians and curators, the eight chapters in this book provide an overview of print advertisements for a range of goods or services: automobiles, entertainment, fashion, food, hospitality, household goods, medical and travel. Beyond offering a glimpse into the material world of a particular period, advertisements may also reveal certain cultural conditions of the day, such as racial prejudices and gender stereotypes.
