Let any unprejudiced European walk through the native<br> 
towns of Java, Singapore and China and see if he can find a<br> 
single native drunk. What he will meet with are numbers of<br> 
drunken English, Scotch and Irish seamen literally rolling<br> 
in the gutters, intoxicated, not from opium but from rum<br> 
and spirits sent all the way from England for the purpose of<br> 
enabling her worthy sons to exhibit themselves to Chinese<br> 
and other nations in this disgraceful light.[^1]

First published in 1846, the above passage by G. F. Davidson was
reproduced in the *Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (SFPMA)*
in 1909.[^2] Europeans who were publicly drunk, in full view of Asians, were
described in the passage as problematic. Extant research on Europeans’
alcohol consumption in British colonies has shown that such perception
was informed by European anxieties surrounding white racial prestige.[^3]
The drinking habits of low-class Europeans, such as seamen and sailors,
elicited anxiety. Barred from accessing exclusively “European” spaces due
to a lack of means as well as class- and profession-based restrictions, these
Europeans typically obtained and consumed alcohol in “public” or spaces
where they intermingled with Asians. The mechanics of inclusion-exclusion
among Europeans operated in part to define “Europeanness”. Its boundaries
were often contingent on “deviance”, even as what was considered deviant
was unfixed and constantly challenged. Examining the ways in which
“European deviance” was defined in different contexts and used as an
apparatus to differentiate between Europeans reveals the heterogeneity of
the colonial society, which is so often portrayed otherwise.[^4]

As the opening quote suggests, the problematisation of some behaviour
such as public drunkenness was conceptualised in relation to its visibility
to the Asian population. Such exposures, according to colonial rhetoric,
potentially lowered European prestige in the eyes of the colonised. Yet,
to what extent was this concern justified in reality? Thus, apart from
examining the ways in which Europeans constructed European deviance,
I am interested in how Asians regarded such behaviour. Reviewing how
incidents of European deviant behaviour were reported in English- and
Chinese-language newspapers sheds light on the issue. The existing research
on newspapers in colonial Singapore helps elucidate the similarities and
differences between the two.[^5]
was a long-running daily newspaper, I examined one issue per month in
order to cover the entire period. Other newspapers, such as the *Malaya
Tribune*, the *Straits Times*, *SFPMA*, and *Sin Chew Jit Poh* (星洲日报),
served as cross-references. Examining the press coverage of the inquests
into the deaths of two Europeans, Douglas Vincent Gibson and Olvard
Wohl Schroeder, reveals varied perceptions of deviance and its role in social categorisation.

#### **European Deviant Behaviour in Colonial Singapore**

In colonial Singapore, whether a European’s behaviour was perceived as
deviant depended on and marked one’s distance from the ideal “respectable”
European. The boundaries of Europeanness, contingent and unfixed, were
sensitive to racial tensions in colonial contexts, and were class- and genderspecific.[^6] Respectability was emphasised as a criterion of Europeanness,
not only as a justification for colonial rule, but also to keep “potentially
subversive” Europeans in check.[^7] In the early 20th century, the construction of Europeanness was closely intertwined with that of whiteness. In colonial
settings, whiteness and its privileges were conferred when individuals
exhibited a set of behaviour and characteristics that corresponded to the
projection of racial prestige, which required prescriptive social rules and
the resources to adhere to them.[^8] The distinctions within the European
population in colonial settings were dictated by conventions of European
middle-class respectability.[^9] As the “exclusionary politics of colonialism”
demanded conformity, deviations from such conventions, or displays
of behaviour deemed incompatible or contradictory, destabilised and
challenged the boundaries of Europeanness.[^10]

The proximity and visibility of European deviant behaviour to the
colonised Asian populations shaped how problematic it was. Colonial
authorities and Europeans of higher social status balked when Europeans
were found behaving undesirably in “public” or in spaces where they could
be seen by people of various ethnicities, as compared to European-only
spaces. Such indiscretions were feared to threaten the colonial sociopolitical
hierarchy, and contributed to the colonial elites’ anxieties surrounding
racial prestige.

#### **Reports of European Deviant Behaviour in Newspapers**

The press played an instrumental role in amplifying some behaviour as
deviant and reinforced associations of low-class Europeans and deviant
behaviour. As a producer of discourse, the press constructed narratives
through reportage and advocated for interventions from the colonial
authorities and civic organisations towards purported crises.[^11] The various
English-language newspapers often carried similar or reproduced accounts
of perceived deviant behaviour of Europeans. The *Straits Times*, especially,
was considered by the residents in Singapore as a “European paper”, pertaining to its readership and perspective.[^12] The proliferation of accounts
thus illustrates not just anxieties surrounding European deviance, but also
their role in cautioning “respectable” Europeans against similar actions.

European drunkenness in public, for example, was often reported
in English-language newspapers as being accompanied by “disorderly”
conduct, such as violence. The perpetrators were typically identified as
transient Europeans or Europeans of lower social status, such as seamen
and rank-and-file soldiers.[^13] In 1931, the *Straits Times*, *SFPMA*, and *Malaya
Tribune* reported that a Private Edward Hayes had allegedly assaulted a
police constable in Hill Street while intoxicated.[^14] These reports would
have reinforced contemporary stereotypes of working-class or lower-status
European men as oft-drunk and violent.[^15]

The case also highlights the spatiality of what constituted European
deviant behaviour. Europeans of higher social status and with greater
financial resources could afford to consume alcohol at premises that served
exclusively European clientele, such as clubs and hotels.[^16] Their imbibition
of large quantities of alcohol and drunken behaviour were rarely reported
in the newspapers. In contrast, Europeans of lower social status, who were
typically excluded from these places, obtained their alcoholic beverages
from spaces designated as “public”, such as public houses, liquor shops
and grogshops. Inter-ethnic interactions took place in these spaces, as
the beverages in these places were affordable, fuelling colonial anxieties
surrounding the visibility of European drunkenness and disorderliness.
According to newspaper reports, Europeans were typically arrested for
drunk and disorderly conduct near the docks at Tanjong Pagar, an area
frequented by Europeans of lower social status, further illustrating their marginality.[^17] As being “drunk and disorderly” in public was liable
to criminal charges, the proliferation of reports on such behaviour by
Europeans of lower social status reveals the disproportionate impact that
the criminalisation of such behaviour had on them. That the Europeans
who were deemed to have engaged in deviant behaviour were often of lower
social status highlights the relationship between space, social marginality,
and mobility.[^18]

European deviant behaviour was discussed in English-language
newspaper editorials, and readers wrote letters to the editors, urging the
colonial authorities and social reform organisations to intervene. “Anxious
Parent”, for example, wrote to the editor of the *Malaya Tribune*, calling for
measures against prostitution. Brothels in the city centre, he proclaimed,
were tempting young British men to step on the “Road to Ruin”. He
questioned:

   What on earth is the use of preaching morality in our schools,<br>
   churches and chapels when immorality is allowed to thrive<br>
   and flourish almost one stone’s throw from our schools?<br>
   What are the missionaries doing? Why don’t they stir up the<br>
   responsible authorities? Is it not within their purview?[^19]

The editor concurred, remarking that “surely the authorities have the
power to control so degrading an evil flourishing in the very heart of the
city.”[^20] Another letter agreed with the sentiments made, commenting that
the Esplanade had been made “the happy hunting ground of ladies of easy
virtue and the demi-monde generally every evening of the week”.[^21]

In the Chinese press, on the other hand, incidents of European
deviance were typically confined to coverage in the “local news” (本坡新
闻) or “important local news” sections (本坡要闻). While evidently deemed
worthy of being reported, these cases did not prompt the kind of exuberant
discussion found in the English papers, likely owing to the significant demand for news from China because of its evolving political situation, or
simply the readers’ lack of interest in this topic.

The Chinese papers’ reports of European soldiers’ drunken and
disorderly behaviour suggest that deviant behaviour by Europeans –
particularly those of lower social status – was “visible” and noticed by the
Chinese population. In *Nanyang Siang Pau*’s report on the Hayes case,
Hayes was referred to as a *qiuba* (丘八)[^22] – a derogatory term for rankand-
file soldiers who had been in the military for a long time and acquired
deviant habits.[^23] The use of this term illustrates the stereotyping of lowranking
soldiers as disorderly. It also suggests that the Chinese differentiated
between “respectable” and “disreputable” Europeans, and that the latter
were identified by their deviant behaviour or disorderliness.

In February 1931, when a group of soldiers of the Welch Regiment
smashed the display windows of several shops and garages along Orchard
Road, they were described in English-language newspapers as having gone
“amok” and “behaving like lunatics”.[^24] In the 20th century, “amok” was a
racialised term that connoted “nativeness” and mania.[^25] Such descriptions of
the soldiers’ actions conveyed European disapproval of the behaviour; they
sought to establish a social distance between “respectable” Europeans and
these Europeans by emphasising the superiority of European rationality –
the cornerstone of British colonialism – vis-à-vis “native” irrationality, even
as they simultaneously undermined European superiority.

*Nanyang Siang Pau* adopted similar language in its headline: “Drunk?
Crazy? Welch soldiers create trouble in Orchard Road, glass windows
smashed”.[^26] The report continued: “according to rumours, the soldiers had lost their composure and caused a commotion because they had consumed
excessive alcohol”.[^27] Such postulation about whether the soldiers were
drunk was absent in the English reports, which suggests that the association
between soldiers, perceived inherent disorderliness and drunkenness was so
entrenched that the reporters of the English papers did not find it necessary
to state that the soldiers might be intoxicated. By attributing the soldiers’
disorderliness to intoxication, the Chinese-language press stopped short of
accusing these men of being crazy or irrational, which would have directly
contradicted the colonial rhetoric of European superiority and rationality.

The headlines of the Chinese-language newspaper reports of European
deviant behaviour were typically descriptive and at times sensationalised,
although such sensationalism was certainly influenced by the papers’
overall editorial and presentation style. In comparison, the English papers’
headlines were typically less descriptive. In January 1939, a soldier by the
name of James McAlister was charged with “disorderly behaviour in public”.
A member of the Loyal Regiment stationed at the Gillman Barracks,
McAlister was spotted by a policeman allegedly harassing passersby while
intoxicated in Waterloo Street. Thereafter he assaulted the policeman as he
resisted arrest, and damaged furniture in the Beach Road Police Station
lock-up. He was charged in the Second Police Court, and the news was
reported in the papers over the following two days.[^28] The articles in the
English papers generally had short and sometimes vague headlines. The
*Straits Times* reported, “Soldier charged with disorderly behaviour”; the
*SFPMA* similarly reported, “Charges against a soldier”; and the *Malaya
Tribune* printed, “Policeman’s nose broken: Loyal soldier charged”.[^29] In
comparison, *Nanyang Siang Pau* descriptively reported in its headline
that “McAlister, soldier stationed at Changi [sic], having been drunk and
disorderly, injured police and destroyed property, was charged on three
counts, and a hearing has been scheduled”.[^30]

The hearing on 13 February was also reported in newspapers of both
languages. This time, the English papers had more descriptive headlines
than in their earlier reports of the case. The *SFPMA* wrote, “Loyals private
breaks nose of policeman: Was chasing pedestrians”, and the *Malaya
Tribune* quoted from the hearing that it was “A case of being violently
drunk”.[^31] The *Morning Tribune* (the morning edition of the *Malaya Tribune*)
reported that it was a “‘Case not for leniency’ says magistrate”.[^32] The two
*Tribunes* published similar reports detailing the hearing, with subheadings
highlighting that McAlister had “punched” the police constable after
having drunk “cheap wine”.[^33] All three articles reported that a Lieutenant
H. M. Miles of the Loyal Regiment had testified that McAlister “bore
a good character in the army”, and implicitly posited that the violence
that took place was a consequence of his consumption of “cheap wine”
of seemingly dubious quality.[^34] In particular, in the two *Tribune* articles,
Miles’s testimony was printed in bold under the subheading “Cheap wine”.[^35]
Such presentation reiterated a contemporary perceived correlation between
“cheap” alcohol and disorderly conduct among European soldiers.

In comparison, *Nanyang Siang Pau* carried the headline, “McAlister,
who committed violent assault in Waterloo Street, found guilty on all three
charges”, while *Sin Chew Jit Poh* subsumed McAlister’s case under an article
reporting the court hearing of three British soldiers with a general headline,
“Three English [or British] soldiers violate the law again”.[^36]  Both reports
narrated an account of what happened on 30 January and the sentence
McAlister received, without mentioning Miles’s testimony or the type of
alcohol McAlister had allegedly consumed.

Specifically attributing low-class European disorderliness to the “cheap”
alcohol, the English-language reports legitimised broader European perception of “cheap” alcohol – typically sold by Asians – as dubious and
nefarious. In his memoir, the English merchant W. H. M. Read described
the liquor sold in grogshops that were predominantly run by Chinese
and Indians:

   Brandy was defiled with tobacco juice, and red chilies were<br>
   inserted to give the spirit pungency. I know the case of the<br>
   boatswain of a man-of-war, who drank only one glass of one<br>
   of these concoctions, and was rendered mad-drunk, it being<br>
   more than a week before he was again fit for duty.[^37]

In contrast, the type of alcohol McAlister had consumed prior to the
assault was not mentioned in the Chinese papers, suggesting that the editors
regarded such information as of little significance to their readers. It also
suggests that the Chinese-speaking population did not perceive a link
between cheap alcohol and European disorderliness.

#### **Suicide as Deviant Behaviour**

Even as both English and Chinese-language newspapers represented
European deviance as a low-class European problem, deviance was not
confined to those Europeans. We can examine the shifting parameters of
European deviance by looking at another behaviour: suicide. This section
examines the ways in which European suicide was articulated as deviant
within the European population in colonial Singapore.

Suicide has long been regarded in Western societies as deviant. By
the early 19th century, with the rise of the medical profession, suicide was
promulgated as the result of insanity.[^38]  By the end of the century, suicide
had become increasingly associated with degeneracy and immorality,
and was regarded as representative of national decline.[^39]  These tropes
of European insanity, degeneracy, and immorality were at the heart of
colonial anxieties surrounding the maintenance of racial superiority and
the vulnerability of colonial rule. Rationality and morality were ostensibly characteristics that distinguished the coloniser from the colonised; European
suicide thus potentially undermined racial superiority and colonial rule.
Considering that reputation and respectability were closely intertwined,
and that deviance was associated with lower social status, this section posits
that European suicide elicited acute anxieties particularly when Europeans
of higher social status took their own lives. Hence European deviance was
not a static construct confined to specific groups of people, but rather an
articulation of colonial expectations, manifest in the inclusion and exclusion
of certain Europeans within the category of “European”.[^40]

This section examines the newspaper coverage of the coroner’s inquests
into the deaths of two Europeans, Douglas Vincent Gibson and Olvard
Wohl Schroeder, who were arguably of relatively high social status. As
the respective inquests proceeded, it became apparent that the two men’s
perceived social status contributed to the press coverage. Especially
for European men of arguably higher social status, the boundaries of
Europeanness were premised upon the financial resources to appear
“respectable”. The newspaper articles, in reporting the proceedings of the
inquests, reinforced perspectives of suicide as deviant and illustrated the
importance of reputation and respectability to being “European”.

#### ***Douglas Vincent Gibson***

Douglas Vincent Gibson was the division manager of United Exporters
Limited for Malaya, British North Borneo, Siam and Northern Sumatra.
On the morning of 8 November 1930, he was reported missing by the
assistant division manager, and his body was later found drifting in the
waters off the beach at Changi. An inquest determined that Gibson had
died of drowning, though the exact circumstances of his death remained
unclear.[^41] Rumours ran rife that Gibson had taken his own life by shooting
or poisoning himself. The circulation of such rumours and the authorities’
efforts to disprove them during the inquest – especially considering Gibson’s
prominence and high social status – attest to the categorising of suicide as unbecoming for “respectable” Europeans in colonial settings.[^42] That the
efforts to counter the rumours were reported extensively in the newspapers
illustrates not only that the circumstances of Gibson’s death were of interest
to readers, but also that the press played a role in shaping the discourse
surrounding Europeans’ deviant behaviour.

According to the *Straits Times*, Gibson was a “well-known resident”
of Singapore.[^43] His funeral was “well attended” by “a large number of
mourners”, and many wreaths were sent by prominent companies and
associations in Singapore.[^44] The coroner’s inquest was attended by a number
of Europeans, demonstrating “unusual interest” in the case.[^45] The assistant
superintendent conducting the inquest noted that “the tragedy had caused
quite a lot of talk about town”.[^46] The question of whether Gibson had
committed suicide was significant, as it potentially undermined the basis
of racial superiority and colonial rule. The deviancy of suicide and its
detriment to one’s reputation and respectability were best illustrated at the
conclusion of the inquest, during which Mrs Gibson’s legal representative
implored the jury not to “inflict… the stigma of suicide” on Gibson, an
“honourable and highly respected man”.[^47]

The authorities sought to prove that Gibson had not taken his own life
by establishing that he had no motives for doing so. They first posited that
as Gibson was not “in any financial embarrassment but was as a matter of
fact well off”, there appeared to be no possible reason for him to commit
suicide.[^48]  That the absence of financial embarrassment was equated to the
absence of motive to commit suicide is telling of the significance of wealth
for European men of higher social status in maintaining an appearance of respectability.[^49] The alleged shame from a lack of financial resources
was presumably a sufficient impetus to take one’s own life. It also suggests
that financial embarrassment was one of the few, if not the only, causes for
suicide among European men of higher social status that could be publicly
discussed. The authorities also relied on the medical evidence to counter
rumours of Gibson having shot himself before entering the water, stating
that “there were no external marks of violence either about the mouth
or body”.[^50]

At the opening of the inquest, the assistant superintendent asserted
that there was no need to read out Gibson’s letter addressed to his wife,
which was found on the desk in his room at the Europe Hotel, where he
was staying.[^51] As the inquest proceeded, a member of the jury sought to
eliminate any conjecture of Gibson’s letter as a suicide letter, suggesting that
“it might allay outside gossip” if it was made known that the letter “was also
really a statement of activities written in diary form, and though addressed
to his wife, did not constitute a finished letter”.[^52] As rumours persisted,
the assistant superintendent suggested that “in order to dispel rumours in
town and the belief that certain things were suppressed it was advisable
that the letter found in Mr. Gibson’s room at the Europe Hotel be read and
made public”.[^53] The shift in position regarding the necessity to make public
a private letter illustrates not just the persistence of rumours of Gibson’s
suicide. It also shows that such allegations were considered to be highly
damaging to the reputation of elite European men, and that suicide was
perceived as significantly deviant.

Mrs Gibson’s letters that were received after her husband’s death were
also read out in open court. Her legal representative had asked for some
parts of the letters be read out to “dispel some gossip that had been going
about”.[^54] The two passages that were read out were “I really don’t care what
happens till I come back to you once again” and “Oh, how I long for you.

I shall never, never stop telling you all I have to tell you about how much
I adore you, with all my heart, when we are together again”.[^55]  By showing
the affection between the couple in the letters, both the authorities and Mrs
Gibson’s lawyer sought to demonstrate that his marital relations were not a
possible motive for suicide. The newspapers subsequently published the first
letter in its entirety and extracts of Mrs Gibson’s letters that were “written
in very affectionate terms”, in an effort to counter the rumours circulating
around town.[^56] *Nanyang Siang Pau*, which had been covering the inquest
closely, similarly published the extracts and used one of them in an article
headline – “I shall tell you that I love you with all my heart” (“我将告诉你,
我整个的心儿爱你”).[^57]

The public constituted a space in which ideals of European respectability
could be challenged, and transgressions of the private-public boundary
brought about anxieties among European elites.[^58] Hence, making the
private letters public showed the great extent of anxiety and consternation
among Europeans elicited by the possibility of a European man of higher
social status having committed suicide; the imperative to prove that
Gibson had not committed suicide overrode potential anxieties that could
have arisen from making the private public. The portrayal of Gibson as
honourable, respectable and loving – thus determined to be impossible to
have committed suicide – marked him as an ideal European in colonial
settings and emphasised that suicide was considered by Europeans as
deviant behaviour, especially for European men of prominence and higher
social status.

#### ***Olvard Wohl Schroeder***

Olvard Wohl Schroeder was a Norwegian businessman who operated a
ship chandlery business in Singapore. He was found lying motionless in a room at the Europe Hotel on the morning of 18 December 1925 and
subsequently died from opium poisoning. After a lengthy inquest, the
coroner returned the verdict that Schroeder had committed suicide.[^59] Both
English- and Chinese-language newspapers in Singapore reported his death,
framing it as a “mystery”, as the circumstances surrounding it perplexed
police investigators.[^60] The inquest garnered “considerable interest”, not least
because of the questions surrounding how Schroeder came to his death,
but also because of his appearance as a respectable European man.[^61] But
while Schroeder appeared to be a wealthy man of high social status, he was
not prominent. Subsequent allegations of opium smuggling, indebtedness,
drunkenness, and an extramarital affair set him yet further apart from the
ideal European colonial, and allowed for sensationalistic reporting of the
inquest, which included speculations of suicide and murder.

According to the historian Satoshi Mizutani, having the financial ability
to afford a “European” way of life was crucial to appearing “European” in
colonial settings.[^62] During the inquest into Schroeder’s death, witnesses
were asked for their opinions of his financial status, and their responses were
reported in detail in the newspapers. Many witnesses thought Schroeder
was wealthy, as he had “spent money lavishly”.[^63] Schroeder’s widow testified
that she had thought her husband “a wealthy man” and that they had
“lived in an expensive way”.[^64] Harold Larsen, who was with Schroeder
the night before his death, similarly thought that Schroeder was “well-todo”.
[^65] Soh Cheng Watt, a trader managing a ship chandlery business that had dealings with Schroeder, attested to Schroeder’s successful portrayal of
himself as a man of wealth and status, and stated in his testimony that “he
had been told that Schroeder was a wealthy man”.[^66] The Europe Hotel was
considered by the European population as the “exclusive one for the best
people in the European community” because it enforced strict exclusionary
practices along class divisions.[^67] Thus, that Schroeder was found critically
ill and subsequently died in the Europe Hotel would have impressed upon
newspaper readers from the outset that Schroeder was a man of means. This
image might have helped him to obtain funds from acquaintances with
which to sustain his lavish lifestyle, thus Soh opined that Schroeder must
have killed himself because he could no longer obtain any money from
others.[^68] Similarly, Schroeder’s secretary testified that Schroeder had been
trying to swindle others by promising non-existent goods, and opined that
he had committed suicide because he had been unsuccessful in doing so and
had no money left.[^69]

The newspapers also reported on Schroeder’s drinking. The type of
alcohol and venue where it was consumed were factors that determined if
said imbibition was regarded as deviant or acceptable.[^70]  According to the
reports, at tiffin the day before he died, Schroeder had consumed gin and
bitters, and a small bottle of wine. At night, he drank whiskey and soda, gin
and bitters, white wine and champagne at various hotels such as the Europe,
Adelphi, and Grosvenor. Not only was he drinking in “European” spaces,
but he also paid for his drinks and those of his companions. Afterwards, he
drank several bottles of beer at a public house in Balestier Road.[^71] An empty
bottle of champagne was on the table in his hotel room when he was found
there unconscious, which was published as part of the headline of an article
by the *Malaya Tribune*.[^72] These details largely corresponded to the types of alcoholic beverages and spaces where European men of higher social
status were expected to drink, thus feeding into an image of Schroeder as
respectable and elite.

Schroeder’s wife testified that although Schroeder was partial to white
wine, he had never drunk excessively and that “when it was suggested that
he was intoxicated at the hotel [she] thought it was impossible”.[^73] Larsen
stated that Schroeder was sober when the latter left for the Europe Hotel
after their drinking session.[^74] The assertions that Schroeder remained sober
despite consuming multiple alcoholic beverages aligned with contemporary
tropes of middle-class, European, male self-discipline and control, in
contrast to the perception of oft-drunk European men of lower social
status who consumed cheap alcohol to excess. Yet the Europe Hotel’s
night watchman testified that Schroeder had appeared at the hotel in the
wee hours “a little drunk”.[^75] Another hotel staff recalled that Schroeder
had asked him for champagne at 3 am and took an extra glass for a “lady
friend”.[^76] This drunkenness and the allusion to an affair were inconsistent
with how respectable Europeans were expected to behave in colonial
settings. That a doctor postulated during the inquest that Schroeder could
have overdosed on opium while intoxicated suggests that drunkenness
and drug consumption took place in “respectable” spaces. Yet this was not
considered to be problematic, considering the absence of newspaper reports
featuring drunken European elites.[^77] 

Both the English and Chinese papers typically referred to Schroeder as
a “Norwegian” (挪威人) rather than by his surname, suggesting that he was
not well-known in Singapore.[^78] By way of contrast, the reports of Gibson’s
death and inquest included his name in the headlines, suggesting that
he was known to the readers of both the English- and Chinese-language papers.[^79] Gibson was also referred to as a European (欧人), instead of
English or British.[^80] According to historian John G. Butcher, in British
Malaya, whether one was European carried greater social significance than
being British.[^81] The identification of Gibson as European reflected his
perceived embodiment of the ideal European male in a colonial setting. It
furthermore suggests a hierarchy of European nationalities, with the British
seeming to have a greater claim to Europeanness – and hence a higher status
– than the Norwegian. In this light, the repeated references to Schroeder’s
Norwegian identity can be understood as an act of conferring him a
nominal European status, yet simultaneously marking his distance from the
ideal. That Schroeder mostly socialised with Norwegian steamship captains
and had few other friends, and that he was previously a Second Officer on
a Norwegian steamship, reinforced his distance from the construct of the
ideal European.[^82] 

At first, the image that Schroeder had maintained as a member of
the upper echelons of society with no financial difficulties influenced the
reporting of his death. The *Malaya Tribune* initially ruled out the possibility
of suicide, stating that “his actions on the day previous to his mysterious
death [did] not show that they were those of a man who was contemplating
suicide”.[^83] It suggested that Schroeder’s death was the result of “a clever
plan”.[^84] During the inquest, however, there was a shift in the Englishlanguage
newspaper reporting over whether Schroeder had taken his own
life. Articles covering the first day of the inquest reported that the coroner
had stated that “medical evidence suggests suicide”.[^85] As further revelations
emerged, the papers started carrying headlines highlighting Schroeder’s
perceived disreputable behaviour, and became more sensationalised and speculative. Some of these headlines included “Who is the mysterious Mr
Loon Wong?”,[^86] “Was it suicide?”,[^87] “Suicide or murder?”[^88] Thiis shift in
framing suggests that public discussion of European suicide was considered
less anxiety-inducing when the suicide was committed by a disreputable
European. The sensational headlines can also be understood as a reflection
of European interest in incidents of deviant behaviour carried out by
Europeans of presumed higher social status, which was undergirded by the
imperative to maintain the façade of European respectability.

In contrast, the Chinese papers, from the earliest reports of the inquest,
carried headlines prefiguring the coroner’s verdict that Schroeder had
“committed suicide by poisoning” (服毒自尽).[^89] Although the reports in
*Nanyang Siang Pau* were detailed, their publication did not correspond to
the days on which the inquest was held. This suggests that while there was
presumably interest among the paper’s readers, the interest level was not
enough to warrant keeping up with the inquest proceedings too closely.
Though Chinese-language reports on European deviant behaviour have
been seen to be attentive to its association with social categorisation, the
use of “suicide” in the headlines of articles covering the Schroeder inquest
suggests that the colonial imperative of maintaining European respectability
was not shared among the journalists and readers of the Chinese press.

#### **Conclusion**

In the examination of how European deviance was constructed in colonial
Singapore, newspapers provide us with an invaluable lens. At the same
time that they are a mirror of the times, newspapers are also agents that
shape public discourse, social mores and identity. While both Englishand
Chinese-language newspaper reports reinforced the stereotype that
European deviant behaviour was typically carried out by men of lower
social status, such narratives were complicated when European men of
higher social status engaged in deviant behaviour. Examining the ways in which these cases were reported has shed light on how Europeanness and
respectability were constructed and contested.

The interrelationship between space and social respectability is clearly
seen. Newspaper reports of both languages associated deviant behaviour
with Europeans of lower social status in public areas. As access to Europeanexclusive
spaces such as hotels was controlled, Europeans of lower social
status predominantly mingled in spaces where people of other ethnicities
were also present, thus increasing the visibility of deviant behaviour to the
colonised populations and potentially undermining the colonial rhetoric
of racial superiority. The discussion of Schroeder’s alcohol consumption
shows that perceived deviant behaviour also took place in spaces that
were designated respectable, yet was not perceived as problematic. That
drunkenness and disorderly behaviour in “respectable” and racially exclusive
spaces were not considered problematic suggests that the construction of
European deviant behaviour was contingent on the spaces it took place in
and the presence of Asian persons in these spaces.

Finally, the examination of suicide as deviant behaviour among
Europeans in colonial Singapore illustrates the malleability of the category
of deviance. As deviant behaviour was associated with Europeans of lower
social status, suicide was considered problematic when it was committed
by a European of high social status. Thus, the colonial authorities and the
press sought to dispel rumours of Gibson having committed suicide to
protect his reputation, while details of Schroeder’s alcohol consumption and
his “outsider” status were highlighted in the press in relation to his suicide.
The construct of European deviance, therefore, was an articulation of
colonial expectations that determined the inclusion and exclusion of certain
Europeans within the category of “European” in colonial settings.

On English-language newspapers, see for example: Peter Laurie Burns, “The English-Language Newspapers of Singapore, 1915–1951” (BA thesis, University of Malaya, 1957). For research focusing on individual newspapers, see for example: A. Sundaraju Gunavalli, “The Tamil Murasu: The Evolution of a Local Tamil Newspaper 1935–1974” (academic exercise, National University of Singapore, 1990); _Nanyang shangbao liushi nian 1923–1983_ [南洋商报六十年 1923–1983](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/redir/itemdetails?bid=14322857) \[Sixty years of the Nanyang Siang Pau\] (Kuala Lumpur: Nanyang Siang Pau, 1984).

[^23]: Placed together, the characters for _qiuba_ 丘八 form the word 兵, “soldier”. It is possible that these two characters were chosen as a substitution for the character 兵, which is an approach that Chinese-language newspapers used from time to time. However, the derogatory connotation of the term 丘八could hardly have escaped the correspondent or editor. Therefore, while the use of the term might not have been intentional, it is reflective of the editors’ and readers’ perception of disreputable soldiers.
