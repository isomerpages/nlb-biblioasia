description: I've been through Taban Valley at Bukit Timah Nature Reserve many
  times and never realised until recently how historically important these
  unprepossessing trees are. To the uninitiated, they look like skinny durian
  trees with their dark green leaves. A century and a half ago, the Taban Merah
  (Pafaquium gutta), better known to the world as Gutta Percha, was at the
  centre of an earth-shaking infocomm revolution as great as the introduction of
  the Internet.
