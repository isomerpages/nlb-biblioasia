Singaporeans are perennially eating or else talking about their next meal – such is their obsession with food. The city’s gastronomic scene is renowned, with *makan* (“eat” in Malay) places offering everything from hawker fare to haute cuisine. The inclusion of hawker stalls in the *Michelin Guide Singapore* (the third edition was launched recently1) is testimony of the heights that hawker fare with its humble street food origins has risen to. 

#### **Hawker Tales**

Hawker centres are quintessentially Singaporean institutions. First-time visitors – usually tourists – are often amazed at the rich and affordable array of freshly cooked food conveniently housed under one roof.

The “irony of the hawker centre” in Singapore, notes social scientist and geographer Lily Kong, is that the hawker no longer goes around selling goods.2 Singapore’s hawker culture can be traced to itinerant hawkers from the 19th to mid-20th centuries who literally moved from one place to another calling out to customers and peddling food, drinks and household wares. In order to eradicate problems arising from contamination, improper refuse disposal and traffic congestion caused by makeshift stalls, the government resettled street hawkers within purpose-built standalone hawker centres from the 1970s onwards.

Over the years, street hawker food has made its way to hawker centres, coffeeshops, food courts and even the menus of fancy restaurants.3 The iconic Satay Club at the Esplanade and Glutton’s Square on Orchard Road are long gone, but more traditional hawker centres such as Newton Food Centre, Maxwell Food Centre and Chomp Chomp Food Centre still pack in the crowds despite competition from fast food outlets, air conditioned food courts and new-fangled cafes.4

#### **Kopitiam and Coffee Socks**

The ubiquitous *kopitiam* (literally “coffeeshop”; *kopi* meaning “coffee” in Malay and *tiam* for “shop” in Hokkien) is found in almost every neighbourhood in Singapore, with many open 24/7 for people who need their coffee (or supper) fix. Coffeeshops have been around for as long as people remember them and have come to symbolise our forefathers’ entrepreneurial spirit.

The coffeeshop is patronised by Singaporeans from all walks of life. It is a place where one can enjoy good local food and catch up on gossip over a freshly brewed cup of *kopi* or *teh* (“tea”) paired with toast slathered with *kaya* (coconut jam) and half-boiled eggs drizzled with dark soy sauce.

There are no baristas at these coffeeshops, just “uncles” and “aunties” who have mastered the art of making that perfect cup of coffee. Doctor and food blogger Leslie Tay remembers the “uncle in pajama pants making kopi” and reminisces that “stepping into Heap Seng Leong [along North Bridge Road] is like stepping into a time portal”.5
