One of six provinces on the island of Java, Yogyakarta is home to a wealth of objects and rich history originating from the era of the Mataram Sultanate in the 17th century. Centred in the Kotagede District, the birthplace of Yogyakarta, the Sultanate was born from a fusion between the former Yogyakarta Sultanate and the Kadipaten Pakualaman, which was part of the disintegrated Kingdom of Mataram.

This region once played an important role in Indonesian politics when Indonesian leaders moved the seat of the government from Jakarta to Yogyakarta in January 1946. The Dutch army subsequently attacked and seized Yogyakarta in December 1948 and arrested key Indonesian leaders. In March 1949, the Indonesian national army launched an offensive and was able to wrest the city out of Dutch control for a short-lived six hours. This, however, triggered a sequence of events that eventually saw Indonesia gaining independence from Dutch colonial rule in December 1949.

Yogyakarta was conferred a special status, and is referred to as Daerah Istimewa (meaning special region) of Yogyakarta, or DI Yogyakarta or DIY. However, this area is more commonly known as Yogyakarta City, Jogjakarta, or Jogja for short. Whatever its name, this province with the second smallest area after the Special Capital Region of Jakarta not only enjoys a preeminent position in Indonesia but is also a popular haunt for international tourists.

#### **Jogja: The Education City**

With its magnificent palaces, temples, coastlines, rich art and culture, diverse nature and delicious food, Jogja is usually thought of as a tourist destination, second only to the more famous province of Bali. No less important is the title it bears as a city of education, or a city of students. With its unique position as Indonesia’s centre of cultural education, Jogja is shaped by the mix of students that come from various regions of Indonesia or even from other countries.

Supported by its peaceful natural environment, friendly locals and relatively lower cost of living compared to other Indonesian big cities, Jogja is the preferred choice of students pursuing higher education. Statistically, 20 percent of its over 3.5 million productive inhabitants are students who are enrolled in its approximately 137 state and private universities (2011 survey). In a city known for “training and disciplining” prospective leaders of the nation, Jogja boasts an academic atmosphere that encourages study, teaching and personal development.

Jogja sees the university library as playing a vital role in supporting its study and teaching initiatives. In order to meet the information needs of the academic community, including faculty members and students, every library in Jogja has the obligation to supply information resources to all levels, from undergraduate to post graduate studies, and of course, for academic staff. In addition, the library should make reading rooms available for its users, especially for those completing their doctorate studies. Beyond that, the library has to provide an effective circulation service for different categories of users, and an active information service for tertiary students, local industrial institutions and other interested parties.
