Kunnuck Mistree arrived in Singapore in 1825 as a convict. Over time, he gained his freedom, raised a family, became a “native doctor”, received a pardon and eventually died a wealthy man. As a result of painstaking research by educator and writer Vandana Aggarwal, we now have an insight into the life of one of the earliest people from India who came to Singapore. 

This documentary is based on [Vandana’s article](/vol-16/issue-4/jan-mar-2021/kunnuck) of the same title that was published in the Jan–Mar 2021 issue of *BiblioAsia*.

<br>From 1825, Singapore began receiving Indian convicts from British India to serve out their sentences as well as assist with the labour shortage and development requirements in the colony. The transportation of convict labour to Singapore ceased in 1873. The convicts were either sent to other colonies, given freedom to settle in Singapore, or repatriated.
