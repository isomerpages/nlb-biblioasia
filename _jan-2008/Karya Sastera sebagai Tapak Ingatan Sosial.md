description: "Memory plays an important role in our life. It forms a bridge
  between the past and the present. Places, events and characters in literary
  works are some elements that can trigger social memories. This is illustrated
  in three novels: Atas Nama Cinta, Mail Mau Kawin and Batas Langit."
