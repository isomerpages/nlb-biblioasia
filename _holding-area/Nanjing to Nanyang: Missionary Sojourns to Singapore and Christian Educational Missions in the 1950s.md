#### Upheaval in China saw missionaries shifting their sights and resources to Singapore and the region, establishing related institutions and reaching the masses through education.
By Joshua Tan

In January 1955, two American missionaries, C. Stanley Smith and William P. Fenn, serendipitously met each other in Singapore. Both were previously Protestant missionary professors in Nanjing, the capital city of Republican China – Fenn at Nanking University (Jinling Daxue) and Smith at Nanking Theological Seminary. Having been exiled from the original “mission fields” in China, they found themselves in Singapore, working on new missions among Chinese students in the diaspora.

Following the Chinese communist revolution of 1949, many American missionaries like Smith and Fenn, searched for alternative mission fields in Asia where they could redeploy resources and personnel slated for China. In doing so, missionary work in China was now displaced into other regions of East and Southeast Asia, starting with ethnic Chinese communities in the diaspora. The British port-city of Singapore, with its ethnic Chinse majority and the government’s receptiveness to American missionaries and funds, proved to be a fruitful site for the expansion of these “China missions.”[^1]

#### From Nanjing to Nanyang: Missionary Sojourns from China to Singapore

The large contingent of missionaries departing China – some of whom converged on Singapore’s shores in the early 1950s – was one of the myriad ways that the 1949 Communist revolution in China and an emerging Cold War in Asia, unexpectedly shaped local Christian communities. As historian Creighton Lacy notes, out of an estimated 4,000 Protestant missionaries departing China on the eve of the communist takeover, over 2,000 were subsequently redeployed to new mission fields in Asia – particularly in regions such as Japan and the Philippines, with their strong American political influence and receptivity to missionaries.[^2]

In Singapore and Malaya, most of the missionaries who arrived from China were recruited by the colonial government to support the state’s welfare and developmental work in the Malayan New Villages.[^3] (During the Malayan Emergency (1948-60), colonial authorities resettled half a million rural dwellers in Malaya, mainly Chinese, to cut them off from the activities&nbsp;of the Malayan Communist Party.[^4] At least 400 missionaries from all mission boards were engaged in New Village work, with 111 of them from British missionary societies. In Singapore, specific numbers of missionaries entering the colony in this period are difficult to ascertain, as many passed through briefly either en route to work in the Federation or in Southeast Asia. For instance, the China Inland Mission (CIM), one of the largest groups to relocate its headquarters from Shanghai to Singapore, saw 130 missionaries arriving in Singapore in 1952, although they soon scattered across Southeast Asia.

However, missions work was not simply concerned with the rural Chinese in the New Villages. In fact, some missionaries like Fenn and Smith, with their decades of experience as professors in China, were deeply concerned with supporting the needs of urban Chinese students. Thus, they were also keen to lend their expertise in the area of higher education in Singapore.&nbsp; A survey of the religious landscape of Singapore in the early- to mid-1950s reveals the establishment of several new institutions such as the Singapore Theological Seminary (later the Singapore Bible College), Trinity College (later, Trinity Theological College), and the Singapore Catholic Central Bureau, supported by funds redirected from China, expressly to meet the needs of “overseas Chinese” students in Southeast Asia.

Beyond supporting churches, some missionary-funded institutions were deliberately located near secular higher educational institutions to facilitate work with students. Some prominent examples include the Jesuit Hostel (Kingsmead Hall) to serve Malayan students attending the Teachers’ Training College, a Franciscan Institute of Sociology in Bukit Batok (to reach students at Nanyang University), and an ecumenical Protestant Christian Students’ Centre (9-11 Adam Road) adjacent to the University of Malaya’s Bukit Timah campus. In fact, former China missionaries, such as Paul Contento of CIM, and the German Franciscan Fr. Guido Goerdes, joined the inaugural faculty of Nanyang University and lived on its Jurong campus, as part of their missionary agenda to monitor communism and spread Christianity.[\[^5]

####  C. Stanley Smith and Trinity College

C. Stanley Smith was a veteran American missionary and representative of the Board of Founders of Nanking Theological Seminary. As principal of Trinity (Theological) College (1954–56), Smith had an instrumental role in shaping the college into Singapore’s premier ecumenical Protestant seminary.

Trinity College was formally founded in 1948 as a Union College and Training School supported by American Methodist personnel and funding, with nominal representation from Anglicans and English Presbyterians. Plans for a Methodist College and vocational school to support local church workers and lay-Christian leadership were in place before the war. The plan was energised by wartime cooperation among incarcerated British and American missionaries at the Changi Internment Camp. Thus, when the college came to fruition in 1948, among its early cohorts of students were not only seminarians, but a diverse group of students studying both religious and secular subjects.[^6]

Trinity College in the early 1950s was not focused solely on religious education; it was also a training school for teachers. Many of the early graduates of Trinity College believed their mission fields to be middle schools and were often already working part-time as middle school teachers when studying at the college.[^7] At Trinity’s Chinese Department for instance, which was inaugurated in 1951, only six of 27 students were registered in regular courses in theology – the rest were studying secular subjects, possibly on track to careers as middle school teachers as well.[^8]

The first graduating cohort of four students in 1951 saw only two studying for the licentiate in theology, while two others studied Kindergarten Sciences and Home Economics (Wong Shuk-Moy and Ang Jiak-Woon respectively); a balance which was increasingly skewed in favor of the training in secular subjects or preparation to being middle school teachers. In this regard, continuing the earlier work of the Methodist extension and training school.
