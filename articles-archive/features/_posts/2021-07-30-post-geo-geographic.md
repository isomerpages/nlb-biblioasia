"You can render space and suspend time." So writes American author Ronlyn Domingue of the powers of the map-maker, or cartographer, in her fantasy novel The Mapmaker's Wad.

The act of graphically representing the world around us is an early human impulse -judging from the prehistoric engravings of landscapes found in caves and rock shelters.<sup>2</sup> Perhaps the earliest surviving example of a world map is a 2,600-year-old clay tablet<sup> 3</sup> dating to around 600 BCE, representing a Babylonian's view of the world. Some might debate that the tablet cannot be considered a map as it is neither drawn to scale nor does it accurately capture the geographical landscape - for example, the river Euphrates is drawn as a set of parallel lines. From a scientific perspective, this clay tablet would certainly not qualify as a map. What, then, constitutes a map?

According to J.B. Harley and David Woodward, editors of a multi-volume series <i>History of Cartography</i> first published in 1987, "maps are graphic representations that facilitate a spatial understanding of things, concepts, conditions, processes, or events in the human world. "<sup>4</sup> Most scholars who study maps have come to accept this definition of a map. This inclusive definition challenges the generally accepted view of maps as utilitarian, geographical and scientific, and its evolution as a move towards objective "truth". It opens up the discourse on maps as objects that combine both the visual and the textual, as shaped by their makers. Maps need not depict places that are found on our physical earth, such as cosmological maps of paradise and other worlds, nor do they have to be tangible in the way the maps in our smart phones are.

All maps are, in a sense, mental maps as they reflect not only the cultural and historical backgrounds but also the personal perspectives of their makers. This is because maps are simplified representations of space within which map-makers have to decide what details to include or exclude. Maps that claim to provide "accurate descriptions" of a place may be overstating their assertion.<sup>5</sup> Aside from reflecting the worldview of the map-maker, maps can be used to reinforce accepted values and power structures. 

Maps, atlases and globes are often used metaphorically to represent power (real or imagined) and domination over territories. For instance, Queen Elizabeth I has been depicted in a portrait standing on the map of the British Isles,<sup>6</sup> and in other paintings with her hand poised over a globe. In ancient China,the handing over of maps by the defeated state was a sign of submission to the victor,<sup>7</sup> and 17th-century Mughal emperor, Jahangir, was depicted in portraits as standing atop a terrestrial globe.<sup>8</sup>

Maps have a special significance in Singapore. Given the dearth of historical material on Singapore before the arrival of Stamford Raffles in 1819, pre-19th-century maps depicting the island act as important visual records of our early origins. The National Library's latest exhibition, "Land of Gold and Spices: Early Maps of Southeast Asia and Singapore", provides visitors with the unique opportunity to view these rare early maps. This exhibition is part of a larger festival of maps and mapping called "Geo|Graphic: Celebrating Maps and Their Stories" 

"Geo|Graphic", which is a curated combination of exhibitions and programmes, explores the diverse world of maps and showcases the collections of the National Library (NL) and the National Archives of Singapore (NAS), as well as mapping-related artworks by four Singapore artists.

This map is from <i>Itinerarium Sacrae Scripturae (Itinerary of Holy Scripture)</i>, written by the 16th-century pastor and theologian, Heinrich Bunting. The map shows the continent of Asia as Pegasus, the winged horse in Greek mythology. The book, which features the Bible written in the form of a travel account, was first published in 1581. Another map in the book depicts the world in the shape of a three-leaf clover with the scared city of Jerusalem in the centre and with Asia, Europe and Africa as leaves.<br><i>National Library of Singapore Collection.</i>
