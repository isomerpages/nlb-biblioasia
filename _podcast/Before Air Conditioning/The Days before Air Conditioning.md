third_nav_title: Before Air Conditioning
---
<p>Before air conditioning was introduced in Singapore in the 1920s, temperature
control was a matter of architectural design. Environmental historian Fiona
Williamson tells us how people kept themselves cool before air conditioning
arrived, why weather science was important to the colonial enterprise,
and what environmental history can tell us about a city’s development.
