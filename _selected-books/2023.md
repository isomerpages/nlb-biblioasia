<i>From Keroncong to Xinyao</i> is a captivating exploration of Singapore’s vibrant record industry from the early 20th century to the mid-1980s. Researcher, collector and former sound archivist Ross Laird provides an in-depth look at the development of the industry as well as the extensive catalogue of recordings made during this period, revealing how Singapore was once a significant recording centre in Southeast Asia. 

The book highlights the multinational giants and first local record companies, the impact of World War II, the heyday of the 1960s and ‘70s and the industry’s eventual decline. The record industry was shaped through the efforts of its pioneers and innovators, from recording engineers to performing artists, as well as the advent of new technologies. This book presents a fascinating journey through the industry’s triumphs and challenges, charting its resonating contribution to Singapore’s cultural heritage.
