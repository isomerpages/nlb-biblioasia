#### **Episode summary** ####
Home economics was taught in Singapore schools to train teenage girls to be good homemakers. The changing syllabus for this subject over the different decades tells a story of the “ideal” Singaporean woman and gender roles. Food writer and researcher Sheere Ng explores home economics while making a unique pasta dish, one that she was taught in her home economics class. (Hint: It involves a sauce that normally goes with fries!)
