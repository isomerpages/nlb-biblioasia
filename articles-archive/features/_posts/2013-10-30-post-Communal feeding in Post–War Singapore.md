The colonial government’s communal feeding programme was a novel response to chronic food shortages and malnutrition in the aftermath of the Japanese Occupation, and laid the foundation for the basis of social welfare schemes in Singapore.

Between June 1946 and August 1948, Singapore’s colonial gov¬ernment operated a novel com¬munal feeding programme. Supervised by the Singapore Department of Social Welfare, the programme aimed to provide one nutritious meal a day for Singaporeans at affordable prices. Targeted at mainly workers, the meals were provided by the so-called People’s Restaurants located in different parts of the city.

Over two years, the feeding pro-gramme expanded to include a catering service, financial support for the cre-ation of private canteens and a children’s feeding scheme. Though short-lived, the impact of the programme was wide-rang¬ing. It eased considerable pressure on the colonial government at a time when food was scarce, helped established a new so¬cial welfare department, and laid the foundations for a post-war social welfare landscape in Singapore.

#### **ORIGINS OF THE FOOD PROGRAMME**

The return of the British after World War II did not bring immediate relief to Singapore and its people. The delayed return of the British after the sudden surrender of the Japanese resulted in a gaping void. The Malayan Anti-Japanese People’s Army (MPAJA) poured out of the jungles and attempted to establish its authority in Singapore and Malaya — of¬ten violently. Political challenges aside, a critical shortage of rice in Southeast Asia also threatened to undermine British au¬thority by worsening malnutrition and a rampant black market.

The communal feeding programme can be attributed to the recommendations of the Wages and Cost of Living Committee. In May 1946, an inquiry to review the wages of the clerical and working class was commissioned in response to the rising costs of living, particularly the cost of food. After witnessing the desperate conditions of workers, the committee recommended several interim measures, such as temporary cash allowances, capping of food prices, the setting up of canteens by government departments and employers with the means to do so, and opening “in all large urban areas” public restaurants “on the lines of British Restaurants in the United Kingdom.”1 The committee also recommended that the canteens and restaurants “should not be operated under contract but should be run directly by a division of the Welfare Department.”2 

The British concept of subsidised state feeding originated in the early 20th century. An emerging social con-sciousness encouraged the expansion of the state feeding programme, from ini-tially prisoners and the poor to include school-going children and factory work-ers.3 Eventually, this led to the creation of community restaurants — known as National Kitchens during the Great War and British Restaurants during World War II.4 State provision of food not only helped to ration limited foodstuffs, but also raised overall morale during times of war and strife.

#### **THE PEOPLE’S RESTAURANTS**

On 29 June 1946, the first People’s Restaurant opened in a converted godown at Telok Ayer.5 Tan Beng Neo, a Salvation Army volunteer, described the restaurant as an “attap [palm-thatched] shack with barbed wire fencing,” and recalled that they managed to sell two to three thou¬sand meals in two hours.6 The first meal consisted of “rice, pork and vegetables, or rice and fish curry for Muslims, and a mug of iced water.”7 “Nutrition experts” from the King Edward VII College of Medicine also ensured that each meal was “not only tasty, but good.”8 For a paltry 35 cents, the customer received roughly 700 calories of rice, meat and vegetables, or a third of his daily nutritional needs, with coffee or tea.

The Social Welfare Department’s first official report, *Beginnings*, describes the process of buying lunch:

The customer enters by one of <br>
perhaps several lanes leading to a <br>
ticket box. He buys his ticket and <br>
passes on to a long serving counter <br>
where the complete meal is handed to <br>
him in a mess tin [or an enamel plate] <br>
by a server in exchange for his ticket. <br>
On his way to his table he passes <br>
other counters where he can pick up <br>
his spoon and his mug, and dip them <br>
in a sterilizer; where he can collect <br>
files past yet another counter where <br>
occasionally he will find on sale <br>
things like fruit, tinned provisions <br>
and cigarettes, which otherwise he<br>
could only get at inflated prices<br>
from profiteering street hawkers, <br>
agents for the most part of the<br>
black market.9 

By the end of 1946, about 10 People’s Restaurants were in operation at refur¬bished godowns, or as part of existing buildings, including one in the “boxing arena of an Amusement Park.”10 These restaurants were located in “Telok Ayer, Seng Poh Road, Queen Street, Handy Road, Happy World, Katong Kitchen/ New World, Maxwell Road, and Harbour Board.”11 As the People’s Restaurants were targeted at workers, it only served lunch five days a week.

#### **FEEDING SCHEMES**

Overseen by a committee that includ¬ed Lim Yew Hock and Goh Keng Swee (Singapore's second chief minister and second deputy prime minister respective¬ly), the communal feeding programme expanded to include various schemes, such as the People’s Kitchens, Sponsored and Approved Restaurants, Family Restaurants and children feeding centres.

The People’s Restaurants were limited to the confines of the city and could not serve factories and workshops in isolated locations. The Social Welfare Department worked with the Labour Office to sponsor "the formation of factory canteens, with the latter arranging permits for the sup¬ply of controlled foodstuffs and the former provid[ing] the expertise and resourc¬es to get the canteens going."12 About 60 Sponsored Restaurants were established between July and December 1946. The Social Welfare Department also attempt¬ed to work with existing restaurants and invited applications for the Approved Restaurants scheme, where successful applicants could buy controlled foodstuffs on the condition that the meal was sold at prices determined by the Department. Although close to 200 applications were received, only a very small number were deemed suitable after assessment. As such, the scheme was scrapped in favour of other feeding programmes to cater to more urgent needs.

To reach out to more people quick¬ly and efficiently, the Social Welfare Department established centralised People's Kitchens, which could sup¬ply "any number of ready-cooked meals in bulk to any unit anywhere in the Colony...."13 At the peak of the feeding programme in October 1946, nearly 40,000 lunches were cooked and served daily. In a mere six months, over one million meals had been served to the hungry public.14 

The Social Welfare Department paid more attention to those who could not even afford the 35-cent meal. It was rec¬ognised early on that the 35-cent meal was not often "within the reach of the poor, the old, the unemployable and the many-progenied."15 In December 1946, the first Family Restaurant opened at Maxwell Road, selling lunch at only 8 cents per meal. Benefiting from the bulk purchase of army foodstuffs, the Department ensured that the 8-cent meal was similar in proportion to the 35-cent version and even lowered the price of the latter to 30 cents for most of 1947.16 Demand for the 8-cent meal was suffi¬ciently high - all 2,500 meals were sold out on the first day - and three existing People's Restaurants were converted into Family Restaurants by the end of 1946.17

These feeding schemes catered mostly to the working population and its primary objective, in the words of Percy McNeice, the Secretary for Social Welfare, was to "counteract the black market."18 It was not enough just to provide cheap meals. The word had to be put out to the gener¬al public that nutritious food was readily available at inexpensive prices.
The day after the Wage and Cost of Living Committee announced its recom-mendations on 27 June 1946, the colonial government ran an announcement in The Straits Times about the 35-cent lunch being a "reality."19 Both the Governor of Singapore and the Colonial Secretary sat down to lunch at the People's Restaurant at Telok Ayer on opening day, which was duly reported in The Straits Times.20 In the same article, McNeice fired the opening salvo of a rather public battle with the black market. Under the sub-heading "Killing Black Market", McNeice declared that "Our main purpose is to reduce pric¬es and to put a stop to the black market."21 
There was an immediate reaction as rumours began circulating that the cheap meals were only possible because of gov¬ernment subsidies.22 McNeice respond¬ed by giving a detailed interview to The Straits Times, explaining how the 35-cent meal was put together and cited the pric¬es of the various foodstuffs purchased by the Department.23 McNeice declared that all food purchases were made in the open market (at government controlled-prices), and even after taking into consid¬eration the salaries of the cooks and staff, the feeding programme was still able to make a small profit. He observed that peo¬ple were still paying too much for food and offered his services to any restau¬rateur willing to sell meals at the Department's prices.
The novelty of the communal feed-ing programme quickly gained traction and it pressured existing restaurants to at least provide better value for meals they served. The Singapore Free Press con-
