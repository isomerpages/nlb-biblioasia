#### **Introduction**
Who were the so-called “lancing” girls1 of yesteryear? They were the
glamorous dance hostesses from the cabarets of the “big three” worlds of
entertainment in Singapore’s past – New World, Great World and Happy
World – who made a living from “lancing”, a Singlish mispronunciation
of “dancing”.1 This paper examines the way of life of these women in the
cabaret industry, with a focus on two of them who founded The Happy
School, a Chinese school that provided free education for street kids after
World War II . In a bid to regain their pride after having been being looked
down on for working in the cabaret, the “lancing girls” are shown here to
have contributed generously to charity. Speaking to four research subjects
in their 70s and 80s who had once been associated with the cabaret, we
trace the beginnings of Singapore’s nightclub dance scene, observe the rise
of pop music and the evolution of the *cheongsam* as a “lancing” dress. The
unadulterated accounts of the lives of these people offer a candid look at
Singapore’s unique history through the glitz (and sleaze) of the New, Great
and Happy Worlds.

#### **Background of the Cabaret World**
The New World Amusement Park was the first to open in 1923 at Jalan
Besar. Great World Amusement Park at Kim Seng Road opened next in 1931. 
Happy World, located between Mountbatten and Geylang roads, was
the last of the three to open, in 1936. Its name was changed to Gay World in
1964 when cinema operator Eng Wah took over the ownership.2

These parks were similar in their entertainment offerings, which included
shopping, film-going and dining. But what really drew the crowds were
the dance halls or cabarets. New World was famous for Bunga Tanjong,
a cabaret that hosted bands playing Malay tunes and *ronggeng* (a couple
dance likely to have originated from Java, also known as *joget*). Great World
attracted British servicemen and the middle class, with free films, Peking
operas as well as wrestling and boxing matches. Happy World was known
for its Sarong Kebaya Nights at the Happy Cabaret.3

During the war, all three worlds were converted into gambling farms. After
the end of the Japanese Occupation, western music could once again be
heard in Singapore. The cabarets resumed happy times, drawing young girls
into their dance halls to work and help their families put food on the table.
Single men, married men, couples and groups of people seeking after-dinner
entertainment all came trooping back. Bands comprised quartets, trios or a
hotchpotch of music lovers forming dance bands.

The repertoire of music ranged from Broadway to those by famous
composers such as Cole Porter and George Gershwin, to the music of the
swing era; anything that would draw in the masses – even local music
played by *keroncong* (an Indonesian musical style) bands – filled the air of
dance halls. Some of the more popular big bands included those led by
Cecil Wilson, Gerry Soliano, H.H. Tan and Peggy Tan, Sid Gomez and
Alfredo (Fred) Libio, who had his “all-star” Filipino Swing Band.4

#### **Working in the Cabaret in the 1940s and 50s**
So why were women drawn to work in the cabarets? Were they not afraid
that family and friends would frown upon their choice of work? My
search to speak to a former cabaret woman proved serendipitous when I
encountered a man operating the photocopier at one of the public libraries.
He was once a customer of the cabarets, and was still in touch with some
former cabaret women. When I told him I was working on a research paper
about them, he gave me the contact of Wong Siew Wah. The second woman
I met was Wong’s cousin, Ong Swee Neo.

Ong, 75, recalled: “It was 1952. I only studied until Standard 2. I was 12
years old when my mother brought me into the cabaret.” When probed,
Ong did not seem ashamed that she was 12 when she was brought into the
cabaret. “The money was good. My mother kept all my earnings. All I had
to do was sit, chat and dance. I was big-sized. No one could tell my real age.
Customers were kind. They never forced me to drink hard liquor. I would
only drink Green Spot or Red Lion orange crush.”5

Wong, 69, said, “My adoptive mother, Nancy Ho, worked as a ‘Mummy’ in
the cabaret. Her job was to look after the ‘lancing’ girls under her and make
sure that the clients did not try any funny business. These girls were also
known as taxi dancers or *mou luei* in Cantonese. What I remembered about
them was that they were tough women who had to adapt to hard times.”6

Further research into articles on the cabaret women made me realise that
life for the “lancing” girl wasn’t all hunky-dory. An average cabaret girl
could expect to earn about $200 a month, although the more popular girls
had been known to bring home $1,000 a month. In comparison, a senior
clerk working in the government in 1952 earned about $280 a month.7 For
just about anyone back then, earnings of $1,000 a month was a lot of money!

Cabaret girls were easily hired and fired. They had to be mindful of cabaret
etiquette and cultivate good customer relations. Discipline and patience
were vital for survival. Working from 6 pm to past midnight daily at the rate of one dance every three minutes, girls were expected to know their
music and dance steps. A quick change in tune meant slipping from the
foxtrot or quickstep into the *ronggeng* or *joget*. If hired to sit at a table for $13
an hour, the girl was expected to hold her liquor while drinking with four to
six customers. Girls professed to be able to throw up in 30-minute intervals,
and return to the table to keep on drinking. The worst bit of working in a
cabaret was when a jealous wife or girlfriend showed up to create trouble –
the toilet was the safest place to seek refuge.

In the first meeting of the Singapore Cabaret Girls’ Association held in
1939 at Great World, 180 members were warmly welcomed – the real
test, however, was realising “a potential membership of 500 girls”.8 The
early batch of *mou luei* (meaning dancing girl in Cantonese) hailed
from Shanghai and Hong Kong; they too had been members of similar
associations. What could a member expect from the Singapore Cabaret
Girls’ Association? Strength in numbers and, more importantly, a united
voice in fighting for the right to be treated with respect.

Exactly 10 years later, in 1949, membership figures at the Association stood
at 600. When I asked Wong what she recalled of her mother, she said, “She
was very active. She was always looking out for the girls.” As chairperson
of the association, Ho had fought for her girls to receive a tax deduction of
$125 a month “to keep up good appearances essential to their profession”.9
The amount represented about 15 percent of their total earnings. This was
unusual as the tax relief would have meant an official acceptance of the
Association’s recommendation that the girls’ “dresses, shoes, hair setting and
cosmetics” were an allowable deduction.

Following this, Ho successfully lobbied for the Association to change
their name to Singapore Dance Hostesses’ Association, which was a more
accurate reflection of what they did. In addition, she raised money for the
purchase and furnishing of a clubhouse at Lorong 10 Geylang, which cost
close to $15,000, for use by her dance hostesses.10

When I asked Ong if she missed the glitzy world of cabaret after her
fiancé forced her to leave, she said no, adding: “We were poor, I had little
education. My mother was also a cabaret girl, [and] it was the only job I
could do. Once I left, I never looked back.”

So what was life like for Nancy Ho and Ong Swee Neo after they left the
cabaret?

Ho found love and married a man she met at the cabaret; they adopted
three children, two girls and a boy. She also converted to Catholicism. Ong
married her sweetheart and had five children. Today, she is a grandmother
of 11.
