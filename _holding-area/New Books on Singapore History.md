Call no.: 720.95957 TAY

In this memoir and selection of writings on identity, landscape and belonging, architect Tay Kheng Soon reflects on the architecture and urbanism most appropriate for a tropical city in Asia. Born in British-ruled Singapore, Tay was deeply engaged in debates about building a new world that attended the end of colonialism and is concerned about Singaporeâ€™s built environment, including its spiritual one. He taught at the NUS School of Architecture, headed the Singapore Institute of Architects, and was founding chairperson of independent arts centre The Substation.
