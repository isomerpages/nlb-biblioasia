#### **Liu Kang’s many roles as photographer, artist, educator and critic helped paint a new narrative for Singapore’s art history.**

In 1952, four Singapore artists – Chen Chong Swee, Chen Wen Hsi, Cheong Soo Pieng and Liu Kang – embarked on a two-month sketching trip to Java and Bali between 8 June and 28 July. Their aim was to experience and capture a cultural milieu, way of life and landscapes different from what they could find in Singapore. The following year, they presented a group exhibition of more than 100 paintings and sketches arising from the trip.[^1]

The exhibition was warmly received in Singapore when it opened to the public in November 1953. As the editor of _Nanyang Siang Pau_ observed, the crowds visiting the exhibition created a buzz at the otherwise sedate British Council.[^2] At his oral history interview in the 1980s, Chen Wen Hsi recalled with amusement the reception to the exhibition. “That exhibition broke new ground in Singapore. No one had done something like that before,” he said. “Someone called us the Four Master Painters, but we didn’t know how in the world that came about.”[^3]
