#### The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 along with advances in steamships, saw a boom in travellers visiting the East. Senior Librarian _Bonny Tan_ explores travel guides for visitors seeking a leisurely but safe journey to the mystical but demystified Far East.

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*“No part of the world is now to be sacred from the intrusive foot of the tourist*<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*and where the traveler goes, guide-books will ultimately follow….”*<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;G. M. Reith, Padre in partibus, p. 1.

Travellers from Europe saw their journey to the East cut down by as much as half when the Suez Canal opened in 1869. Steamships, helped along with advances in their engine development, were preferred over sailing ships as they proved faster and more efficient. Beginning as mail services dispatching post, ships from companies like the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company soon became vessels for ferrying passengers. In turn, travelogues written by the adventurous sojourner who happened to be sailor, civil servant or missionary soon evolved into travel guides published by travel companies for the paying tourist seeking a leisurely but safe journey to the mystical but demystified Far East.

#### **A Useful Vade-Mecum**

At a time when guidebooks for the Western hemisphere were being churned out by such publishers as Murray and Badaeker, Rev. George Murray Reith, resident minister of the local Presbyterian Church, took it upon himself to write a handy guide to Singapore for visitors to the town.

 &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*“It is intended to supply a felt want in Singapore; to give in a <br> handy form some notes historical, descriptive, scientific, &c, <br> in regard to the town and island; to afford what information is necessary <br> to guide visitors during their stay, and to obviate some <br> of the difficulties which travelers always encounter in a strange  <br>place.”* (Reith, 1892, p. iii).

This “useful vade-mecum” (Reith, 1892, p. iii) or ready reference was designed to help visitors who had merely a few hours to a few days in the town. In contrast, earlier guides that had preceded it, namely, *The Stranger’s guide to Singapore* (1890) by B. E. D’ Aranjo and *Picturesque and busy Singapore* (1887) by T. J. Keaghran had proved too “limited” in their “scope” (Aranjo’s) (Reith, 1892, p. iii) or “too general to be of practical value” (Keaghran’s) (Reith, 1892, p. iii).

Segmented into 15 chapters, the guide starts off with a condensed historical overview of Singapore beginning with its founding in 1819 by Stamford Raffles2 and giving insightful details of events prior to 1900. Reith’s historical overview is based on Buckley’s articles in the *Singapore Free Press* entitled *Anecdotal history of Singapore* which later was to be published as an important text on Singapore’s history.

#### **Descriptions of the Environs**
Following this is a general description of the town and its environs, walking tours or drives, descriptions of buildings and landmarks as well as places of worship and hospitals. Reith does not merely describe landscape and landmark, but waxes lyrical over scenery and the island’s natural beauty. For example in describing the approach to Singapore from the west, he notes:

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*“The scenery has a quiet beauty that impresses every <br> spectator; and as the water in the channel is generally smooth,<br>  all are able to enjoy the prospect. Every now and then the<br>  ship startles a gar-fish that skips nimbly over the surface of<br>  the water to a safe distance. Occasionally a golden-coloured<br> watersnake may be seen hurrying away from the bows.”*<br>  (Reith, 1892, p. 26).

He highlights details which set off the unusual beauty surrounding the island. For example, in the same passage he points to a common optical illusion in which the distant southern islands seem to be suspended above the sea.
In Chapter Four, he gives directions for four tours around and beyond the town, each one accommodating a tourist’s length of stay which could vary from a few hours to half a day. The tours skirt around the wharves through the town to locations such as the Botanical Gardens, the Impounding Reservoir (MacRitchie Reservoir), a climb up Mount Faber, and a carriage ride to Johore Bahru. In delineating the journeys, Reith also paints a three-dimensional picture of Singapore town in the late 19th century, highlighting familiar locations and landmarks now long forgotten, and capturing the leisurely lifestyle of the expatriate along with the labouring duties of the natives.

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*“(There) lies the Esplanade (Padang Besar) a large plain, <br> encircled by a well-laid-out carriage drive. The Singapore <br> Cricket Club, and the Singapore Recreation Club divide the <br> plain between them for the purpose of cricket, tennis, bowls, <br> and other athletic sports, and in the centre stands a fine statue <br> of Sir T. Stamford Raffles, erected in 1887. A large part of  <br>the Esplanade occupies ground recently reclaimed from the <br> sea; and it is now a favourite afternoon resort of the residents. <br>On the landward side are the Hotel de l’Europe (Punchaus Besar) <br> and St. Andrew’s Cathedral (Greja Besar)…”* (Reith, 1892, p. 36).
