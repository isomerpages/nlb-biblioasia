To most people, history is a thing of the past, a memory set in stone. To Ho Yong Min, however, history is a living thread connecting historical accounts and events to the present and, more importantly, to the shared experiences of Singaporeans.

Ho Yong Min, who prefers to be known as Yong, first led heritage walks around Singapore as a hobby in 2010. Having majored in urban geography at the National University of Singapore, Yong is aware of the connections between old places and buildings and contemporary life.

Through [The Urbanist Singapore](https://urbanistsingapore.com/), a company focused on sharing Singapore's urban heritage, Yong educates Singaporeans on how vestiges of our fascinating history are interwoven into the urban and social fabric of Singapore today. “There were always these stereotypes \[about Singapore being dull\]. And I was quite determined to show that Singapore is not boring and clinical,” he said.

#### **Framing the Past**

In December 2023, Yong launched into the social media scene. He began creating engaging short-form video content for platforms like TikTok and Instagram under the handle, The Urbanist Singapore, delving deeply into the Singapore urban landscape and its history. &nbsp;

Six months later, Yong left his job at the Singapore Management University as the Associate Director for Undergraduate Education to fully pursue his social media career. This gave him more time to uncover the hidden stories of Singapore’s cultural and urban heritage with Singaporeans and foreigners alike. “I felt that we are very distracted as a generation. Arts and heritage \[became\] more of an afterthought than something that we care and think about,” he said.

#### **Hunting Down a Lead**

One of his most popular videos is on the [forgotten Stamford Canal](https://www.instagram.com/p/C4ekEKtS6Ra/), released on 8 March 2024, which has since garnered more than 47,000 likes on Tiktok and over 4,000 likes on Instagram. It started with him wondering why there were so many escalators at Citylink Mall. People had to go down an escalator only to go up again about 10 m away, and there was also no direct connection between Basement 1 of Raffles City and City Hall MRT Station. It turned out that the numerous escalators were structured in such a way to avoid the still present but concealed Stamford Canal.

When Yong was researching his video on the [Anchorpoint](https://www.instagram.com/p/C1_qxdOSLzC/)&nbsp;shopping mall, he discovered the interesting story behind the name of the nearby ABC Brickworks Market &amp; Food Centre. The letters &nbsp;“ABC” came from the food centre’s proximity to the former Archipelago Brewery Company (ABC), the producer of Anchor beer, while “Brickworks” referred to Alexandra Brickworks which once stood at the junction of Pasir Panjang and Alexandra roads.[^1] \[Fun fact: The bricks produced by the company were used to construct public buildings, including the&nbsp;former National Library on Stamford Road, the Tiong Bahru flats by the Singapore Improvement Trust and the Gillman Barracks.\] This inspired him to make a video on the history and heritage of the [ABC Brickworks Market &amp; Food Centre](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DEV0OamyYWq/), released in January 2025.

“Sometimes, you also stumble upon things that you were not searching for, but because you were clicking here and there, you see other images, images that \[showed a place\] you never knew look like \[this\]. And then, maybe that sparks off an idea for another video,” Yong said.

#### **Working with Historical Records**

Yong embarked on The Urbanist Singapore to make history come alive and bridge the past and the present. “I want to use old photos to show \[people\] what it is like today or \[do a\] compare and contrast, to talk and have discussions around what’s still here and what’s gone,” he said.

For his March 2025 video on the [origins of the name Dhoby Ghaut](https://www.instagram.com/p/DHuME0lTr0x/) (from&nbsp;the Hindi word _dhobi_, which means “washerman”, and&nbsp;_ghat_, which refers to the steps leading down to a body of water), Yong included a 1900s photo of Indian washermen from the [National Archives of Singapore](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/). These _dhobies_ used to wash laundry in the Stamford Canal. The photo provides a visual link to an old trade of Singapore that we no longer see today.[^2]
