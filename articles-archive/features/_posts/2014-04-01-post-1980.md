The literary scene in postwar Singapore was flooded with newcomers in the Chinese creative writing scene. Among all the genres, children’s literature, in particular, received special attention from the government, who encouraged writers to create works for children using Singapore as the backdrop. By the early 1980s, children’s literature was a hot topic, discussed and debated at length in numerous articles in various Chinese newspapers. Given the attention it received, Jessie Yak conducted a study on Chinese children’s literature published in the 1980s that adopted Singapore as the setting, with a particular focus on how local children were portrayed in these novels and short stories.
