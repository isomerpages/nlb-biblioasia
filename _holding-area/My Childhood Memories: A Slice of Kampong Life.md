When I was a child during the late 1970s and early 1980s, my parents would take me from my maternal grandparents’ home in Hougang and bring me to my paternal grandfather’s home in Kampong Wak Hassan near Sembawang Park. I would stay there every weekend and for a short period during the Lunar New Year.

As I suffered from motion sickness, the bumpy hour-long ride often made me dizzy and nauseous. But my mood would lighten whenever our car turned into the bendy narrow Old Upper Thomson Road. The sight of black-and-white bungalows along the road flanked with lush rain trees was a sign that we were almost there.

The next scene that greeted us were the coconut trees and myriad of fruit trees, followed by the sound of lolling waves. &nbsp;I would relish the gentle, briny sea breeze on my face and enjoy the sight of busy soldier crabs scavenging on the sandy shore at low tide. I spent countless leisurely weekends at my grandfather’s kampong that saw the ebb and flow of tides, along with the rhythmic chorus of insects.

**A Kampong by the Sea**<br>
Before World War II, my great-grandfather left his home village in Jieyang, Guangdong, to seek a living in Nanyang (“South Seas”, 南洋; to refer to Southeast Asia by early Chinese migrants) when his sugar processing factory was destroyed by floods. He first settled down in Thailand. Burdened with debt and the need to feed his family, he started selling _chendol_ (a Southeast Asian dessert). Shortly after, also before the war, he relocated to Kampong Wak Hassan, a Malay village in northern Singapore facing the Strait of Johor.

As most of the villagers were fishermen, my great-grandfather also became one and was joined by my grandfather. They worked hard to pay off the debts and saved enough to open a provision shop in the village. The shop and the adjoining house were fondly referred to by family as “Ah Gong’s house”.

Kampong Wak Hassan – with its mix of Malay, Chinese (mostly Teochew) and Indian villagers – was one of several coastal villages dotting Singapore's northern coastline. Interestingly, there was a Teluk Jawa fishing village in Johor known as “Ang village” established during the 19th century as most of the Chinese villagers came from the same province as grandfather and were fishermen as well.

In the village, we would wake up to the loud booming voice of a Chinese fisherman from Johor. He would arrive in a motorboat filled with his catch for the day and set up a temporary spot near my grandfather’s provision shop to sell fishes such as grouper and _kembong_ (Indian mackerel). In those days, it was easy for Johor fishermen and villagers in the kampong to meet and trade, but as they grew older and with Singapore's stricter maritime law enforcement, such interactions soon came to a halt.

In 1966, the kampong welcomed its first asphalt-paved main road, Jalan Kampong Wak Hassan, opened by Minister of State for Culture Lee Khoon Choy. During his speech, he praised the villagers as he had heard that “Kampong Wak Hassan is a model village where the Chinese, Malay and Indian villagers get along well with each other”.[^1] The other side lanes remained as sandy paths with potholes filled with stones or rocks of various shapes and sizes. Cyclists passing through needed to be skilful to avoid a bad fall.
