<p>You hear Malay, Javanese, Tamil and Punjabi as you wander the streets
with shops selling colourful textiles and carpets, spices and flowers.
Here you find different curries and bread, <em>nasi padang</em>, <em>sup tulang</em>, <em>mee siam</em>,
a Javanese kitchen, Hainanese coffeeshops. Bookstores sell literature and
newspapers as far away as Cairo. In this episode, Khir tells us about the
Kampong Gelam (present-day Bugis) he grew up in.</p>
