#### The Jurong Drive-in was Singapore’s one and only drive-in cinema. In its heyday in the 1970s, it was packed bumper to bumper with vehicles. **Sharon Teng** tracks its rise and subsequent decline.

A drive-in cinema conjures up breezy fun, adventure and romance under the stars. Singapore’s one and only drive-in cinema, the former Jurong Drive-in, opened 50 years ago. It only lasted 15 years but during its short lifespan, it left indelible memories.

The Jurong Drive-in Cinema opened on 14 July 1971 and it was touted as the next “in-thing” that would revolutionise the movie-watching experience. Constructed at an estimated cost of $3 million, this was the first drive-in cinema in Singapore and Malaysia and also the largest in Asia at the time. 

A full-page announcement was published in the Straits Times on the day of the cinema’s opening. In it, the Deputy Chairman of Cathay Organisation, Heah Hock Meng, wrote that the new drive-in promised that patrons would be treated to first-class movie entertainment and there would be “no parking problems, no parking fees; no need to worry about acoustics because every car will have its own speaker which can be adjusted to suit the patron’s needs”. In addition, patrons would not have to “worry about what you wear… [and if] the baby cries or your wife inadvertently drops her handbag with a clatter at a crucial moment in the film, you will get no hard looks because, of course, you have complete privacy in your own car”.[^1]

#### **Location and Amenities** 

The construction of Jurong Drive-in was no easy task. It occupied 14 acres (5.6 hectares) of land along Yuan Ching Road, adjacent to Jurong Park, at a site now occupied by ActiveSG Park @ Jurong Lake Gardens. The site required 340,000 cubic yards (259,939 cubic metres) of earth to fill in the landscaping just for the installation of the giant screen. Measuring a whopping 47 ft by 110 ft (14.3 m by 33.5 m) and suspended 25 feet (7.6 m) from the ground, the screen was also tilted at an angle of six-and-a-half degrees for optimal viewing from the inside of a car. 

The sound system was supported by a projector that had a range of 275 ft (83.8 m) compared with 140 ft (42.6 m) for a typical indoor projector. Speakers were hooked onto either side of posts, one for each car. A car would park alongside a post, with the windscreen facing the cinema screen, and the speaker would be draped over the car window or door. Due to the terraced gradient, all cars enjoyed a clear and unobstructed view of the screen. Walk-in patrons could avail themselves to the 308-seat sheltered viewing gallery, which was installed with loudspeakers and fans.[^2]

Ensuring the smooth entry and exit of vehicles from the cinema required careful planning. Cars coming from Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim would turn into Yuan Ching Road to reach the entrance of the drive-in. Car marshals were on hand to guide drivers to empty parking bays, particularly latecomers, to avoid dislodging those who had arrived earlier and were already in their chosen lots. There were two screenings each night – 7 pm and 9.30 pm – and cars arriving for the later show would wait in a large holding area that could accommodate 300 vehicles. As soon as the first screening ended and cars had vacated the lots, then the next lot of cars would be allowed to enter.[^3]
