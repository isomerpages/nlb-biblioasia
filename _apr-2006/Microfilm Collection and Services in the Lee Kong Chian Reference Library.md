#### Microfilming the National Library’s collections began in the 1950s to preserve and archive Singapore’s documentary heritage. The collection includes newspapers; rare and out-of-print books; periodicals and directories; government publications; and dissertations.

Microfilming the National Library’s collections began in the 1950s. It was initiated as a move to preserve and archive Singapore’s documentary heritage. Beginning with a collection of old newspapers and manuscripts, microfilming activities was stepped up to include the filming of government records, as well as rare and out-of-print Singapore materials.

Over the years, this collection was further enhanced through the addition of titles acquired from the British Library, Malaysian libraries, National University of Singapore Library, University Microfilms International and the Library of Congress. Today, the collection has grown to an extensive archive of 24,000 microfilm reels and 12,500 fiches that forms an integral part of the Singapore and Southeast Asian collections at the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library.

The collection, housed at Level 11 of the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library, is an invaluable and rich resource to many users, from the researcher of Singapore history, the student conducting social and business research, the heritage seeker pouring through Singapore’s earliest imprints and Jawi manuscripts, to the individual tracing his family roots.

The microform collection can be broadly categorised into newspapers, rare and out-of-print books, periodicals and directories, government publications and dissertations.

#### **Newspapers**
The most popularly used resource is the newspaper archives. The collection comprises approximately 100 Singapore/Malayan newspapers dating back to 1827 with the publication of *Singapore Chronicle and Commercial Register* (1827–1937). In addition to the English newspapers, papers in the vernacular, namely Chinese, Malay/Jawi, and the Indian languages (Tamil/ Malayalam/ Punjabi) are also represented.

The English-language press sources include major papers namely *The Singapore Free Press* (1835– 1869, 1884–1962), *The Straits Times* (1845–), *The Singapore Daily Times* (1865–1882), *The Malaya Tribune* (1914–1951), *The Syonan Shimbun* (1942–1945), *Singapore Standard* (1950–1959) and *The Singapore Herald* (1970–1971) amongst others. The collection also contains a host of short-lived papers such as *Times of Malaya* (1938–1939) and *Eastern Daily Mail* (1905–1908) which appeared during the early 20th century; *The Eastern Sun* (1966–1971) and *New Nation* (1971–1982) in the 1960s–70s; *The Singapore Monitor* (1982–1985) in the 1980s and more recently, *Project Eyeball* (2000–2001) and *Streats* (2003–2004). The library also acquires Malaysian newspapers with bearings on the history of Singapore. An example is *The Malay Mail* (1896–1981) which carried news on federal proceedings in Kuala Lumpur.

The early English papers catered to the European reader and were largely commercial in orientation. Common features include shipping news, commodity prices, commercial activities, advertisements and social news. It was only with the establishment of *Singapore Daily Times*, the second English daily in Singapore, that the press began to engage more deeply into politics. International news also increased in numbers and scope with *The Straits Times* subscription of the Reuters News Agency in 1870.

By the early 20th century, non-Europeans had established a number of English papers. One of the more successful ventures was *The Malaya Tribune* which was strong competitor to *The Straits Times*. Supported by Dr Lim Boon Keng and a group of prominent Chinese and Eurasians, *The Malaya Tribune* aimed “to express the views and aspirations of the domiciled communities”.

In the 1970s, the delicate political situation of post-independent Singapore saw the closure of a number of newspapers like *The Eastern Sun* and *The Singapore Herald*. In recent times, attempts have been made to diversify the newspaper business and to liberalise the Singapore media scene through the introduction of new papers like *The Singapore Monitor*, *The New Paper* (1988–), an afternoon tabloid, *Project Eyeball* which targeted the young, educated and savvy readers, and commuter papers like *Streats* (2003) and *Today* (2000–). All have since ceased publication, with the exception of *The New Paper* and *Today*.
