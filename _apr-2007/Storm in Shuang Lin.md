#### Shuang Lin Monastery was once used as a training ground for people who volunteered their services at the Burma Road, which served as a supply route during the Sino-Japanese War in the 1930s. The monastery had a great impact on the lives of two men: Wu Hui Min, volunteer for the war effort, and Venerable Pu Liang, the abbot of the monastery.

The Sino-Japanese War began on 7 July 1937. As the war developed, the Chinese seaports were either captured or blocked by the Japanese who attempted to terminate external supplies entering China. In response, the Chinese government developed alternative land supply routes.

The Burma Road, built as an alternative supply road, became China's most important supply route. The Singapore Free Press described it as China's new munitions and supplies route.1

Construction of the Burma Road between Yunnan in China and Lashio in Burma began in 1937 and was completed in 1938. Supplies were sent by sea to the Rangoon port (Yangon), transported by rail to Lashio and through the Burma Road to Kunming in China. The journey from Kunming to Lashio took about a week, and there were six stations along the route to support the drivers.

Due to the lack of experienced drivers and mechanics in China, the Chinese government requested Mr Tan Kah Kee, the Chairman of the China Relief Fund, to recruit drivers mechanics from Nanyang (South East Asia).

The Nanyang Federation of Relief Fund was founded in 1938 to support China in the Sino-Japanese War. Mr Tan Kah Kee had been elected as its chairman, and its regional office was located at the Ee Hoe Hean Club in Singapore. Representatives of the Fund set up their local China Relief Fund offices to implement programmes, forming a large network around the region.
 
The China Relief Fund raised money to purchase medication, medical equipment, clothing, food and military hardware such as planes, tanks, trucks, explosives and weapons,2 transforming the Overseas Chinese population into a regional force in support of China.
