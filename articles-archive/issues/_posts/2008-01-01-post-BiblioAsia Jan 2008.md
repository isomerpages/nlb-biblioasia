**Rising Dragon, Crouching Tigers? Comparing the Foreign Policy Responses of Malaysia and Singapore Toward a Re-emerging China, 1990–2005**<br>What do states do when faced with an increasingly stronger and/or potentially threatening big power?

**新加坡十九世纪华人教育的改革**<br>Education reforms and the modernisation of education in Singapore and Malaya are often attributed to political changes in China during the early 20th century. Few remember the contributions of local intellectuals in spearheading education reforms before the
1900s. These reformers were multicultural both in their background and outlook. Two notable pioneers in this field are Chan Kim Boon and Khoo Seok Wan.
