#### A former teacher and _mak andam_ fulfils her dream by writing a book on Malay recipes in 1986, the first all-Malay cookbook from Times Books International.
By Toffa Abdul Wahed

In 1986, a cookbook titled _Hidangan Warisan Kita_ (Our Heritage Dishes) was published by Times Books International. Written by Hajah Asfiah Haji Abdullah,1 a matriarch revered for her expertise in the cultural arts, the book was priced at $18 and showcased 178 recipes for a wide array of traditional Malay food,2 namely _kuih-muih_ (an assortment of sweet or savoury snacks), noodles, rice, accompaniments to rice (_lauk-pauk_) and _gubahan_ (elaborately prepared dishes for special occasions such as weddings and engagement ceremonies).3

In her preface, Asfiah invited readers to embark on a journey to discover the authentic ways of preparing traditional Malay dishes. “I sincerely hope that with the publication of this book, all our heritage cuisines and dishes will continue to be cherished, not lost to time, and will become a treasure in our kitchens for generations to come,” she wrote.4

This book represented many firsts. It was the first time that Times had published a cookbook written in the Malay language by a Malay author, and in doing so, the publisher had put Asfiah in the company of familiar household names like Terry Tan and Betty Yew, who had written several cookbooks about Singaporean cuisine, Malaysian cuisine and Peranakan Chinese cuisine for the same publisher.5 

After the book was published, _Straits Times_ journalist Haron Abdul Rahman noted that this was possibly the first of its kind – a Malay cookbook in hardcover no less. This achievement was, he suggested, not so surprising given that “Hajah Asfiah Haji Abdullah, the authoress of _Hidangan Warisan Kita_, is a rare woman where preserving Malay heritage and upholding Malay culture and traditions are concerned”.6

A Champion of Malay Culture, Tradition and Artistry

Born in 1920 in Kampong Gelam, Asfiah began learning the art of making Malay _kuih_ from her mother when she was just 6 years old. She also helped out at her mother’s food stall in front of their house on Bussorah Street, directly behind Sultan Mosque, during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. “My mother taught me how to bake Malay cakes which she herself was very good at. Then I was sent to Rochore Malay Girls’ School, where I learnt handicrafts like embroidery and flower-making,” she told the _Straits Times_ in an interview in June 1986.7

The skills that Asfiah acquired in school further enriched her repertoire. In 1931, after completing Standard Four at age 10, she began teaching Malay handicrafts at the school. “It was difficult at first,” she said. “Many of the girls were only a year younger than me and I could not control them sometimes. I kept having to go to the headmistress for help.”8 Despite her initial challenges, Asfiah found joy in teaching and continued to impart her skills and knowledge to others throughout her life.

After her mother’s death, Asfiah took over the business and the stall remained a regular fixture at the annual food fair in Kampong Gelam. During this time, Bussorah Street would be lined with rows of makeshift stalls that attracted people from all over Singapore for the delicious food. She enticed customers with a smorgasbord comprising _kuih_ and dishes like _mee siam_ and _laksa_. In 1980, Asfiah passed the torch of running the business to her daughters, Salamah, Rasidah and Masita, but continued to help in the preparation of the _kuih_.9 Later, her youngest son also took an interest in learning to run her _kuih_ and _tekat_ (a type of traditional Malay embroidery used to decorate ceremonial items made of velvet with designs created using gold threads) business.10

Known affectionately as Cikgu Asfiah (_cikgu_ in Malay is a title for teacher), she dedicated her life to serving the community and imparting her vast knowledge of Malay culture to the younger generations through not only her cookbook but also via classes at her home on Bussorah Street, demonstrations, talks and exhibitions. The publication of _Hidangan Warisan Kita_ was her crowning achievement, but her contributions to the Malay community extended beyond the culinary realm.

Asfiah was also renowned for her expertise in Malay wedding customs, needlework and flower arrangement as well as traditional skincare, makeup and hairdressing. Although Asfiah made her income from teaching the cultural arts, she firmly believed that it was her duty and responsibility to pass on her knowledge to young Malay girls and women. 

Margaret Sullivan, who featured a chapter about Asfiah and the _kuih_ trade in her book, “_Can Survive, La”: Cottage Industries in High-rise Singapore_ (1985), hailed her as a “teacher and guardian for \[_sic_\] traditional Malay culture in Singapore”. Asfiah “\[saw\] herself as an articulator of traditional values with almost a ‘mission’ to pass on the knowledge before ‘Malayness’ was \[lost\]”.11 In 1987, a journalist with the _Berita Harian_ newspaper described Asfiah as an “activist of Malay handicrafts”, highlighting her unwavering commitment to preserving Malay culture.12

Asfiah developed a profound interest in _kesenian Melayu lama_ (traditional Malay arts), including bridal wear, dressing up the wedding dais and floral decorations for the matrimonial bed. She was, however, unable to devote much time to this interest. In 1949, having retired from teaching after almost two decades, she wasted no time in becoming a _mak andam_.13 The role of a _mak andam_ holds significant cultural importance in Malay weddings. Their duties traditionally involve beautifying the bride, as well as guiding the bride and groom through various rites and ceremonies that take place before, during and after the wedding.14

Asfiah went on to become a well-known and esteemed _mak andam_, a role that she performed for some 20 years. “I must have been a _Mak Andam_ for more than 1,000 brides,” she told the _Straits Times_ in 1986. “I have many fond memories of these occasions, like when I refused to let the best man bring in the groom unless he could answer my _pantun_ (rhyming riddle).” She revealed there had been instances when the best man became so irritated that he would stomp off, leaving the hapless groom behind.15

Asfiah’s remarkable skills and knowledge as a _mak andam_ also led to numerous engagements and invitations from cultural organisations. These include Persatuan Kebudayaan Melayu Singapura (PKMS; Society of Malay Culture, Singapore) and Majlis Pusat Pertubuhan-Pertubuhan Budaya Melayu Singapura (Central Council of Malay Cultural Organisations Singapore), who recognised her as a valuable advocate for preserving Malay heritage and culture.
