**About**:	Xin Yue Reading Community is an offline collaborative reading and in-depth discussion platform founded and organised by Grace Guo Lin Jing. The platform is designed to help members expand their intellectual horizons, deepen their understanding of complex themes and ideas, and discover the inherent healing power that emerges from thoughtful engagement with literature. The book club distinguishes itself through its emphasis on strong interactivity and exceptionally high levels of member participation. Central to the community's philosophy is the guiding concept of "understanding oneself, transcending oneself, and delighting oneself". This three-fold framework encourages participants to use reading as a mirror for self-reflection, a catalyst for personal growth beyond perceived limitations, and ultimately, a source of genuine joy and fulfilment.
