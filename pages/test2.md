Loke Wan Tho (1915–64) was a man with wide interests; he was a film magnate, a support of local sports, a photographer and an ornithologist. His niece, Choo Meileen, chairwoman of Cathay Organisation, called him a renaissance man.[^1]

<h4>A Pioneer in Local Film Production </h4>
 In 1953, Loke Wan Tho set up Cathay-Keris with Ho Ah Loke, expanding the Cathay film distribution business into film production. Cathay-Keris was Singapore’s second film studio and was a competitor to Shaw’s Malay Film Productions. These were the only two film studios in Singapore for the next 20 years, which was known as the golden age of the studios.[^2]

Cathay-Keris focused on Malay films, as Malaya had a fast-expanding film market. In 1951, the Cathay’s International Associated Theatres generated twice as much revenue from Malaya compared to Singapore.[^3]

To learn about moviemaking, Loke visited film studios in India in 1957 and invited Hollywood actors to coach Cathay-Keris’s new actors. At that time, Malay cinema was influenced by Indian culture, as the two film studios hired Indian directors, who were better at making Malay films than their Chinese counterparts.[^4]

The Malay movies then were generally based on folk tales and legends (sg cinema p36). One of Cathay-Keris’s box office blockbuster is Hang Jebat, directed by Hussian Haniff. The movie was noted for its cinematic qualities and revisionist approach to Malay classical history, portraying Hang Jebat as the hero rather than villain.[^5]

For his contributions to the film industry in Malaya, Loke Wan Tho was awarded the dato title in 1962.

Cathay closed its film production arm in 1972, because of competition from television and the loss of the Indonesian market. By then Cathay-Keris had produced at least 100 movies, including the cult classic *Pontianak* film (1957) and the subsequent Pontianak movies.
