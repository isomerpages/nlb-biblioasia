description: "Among the older generation of Singaporeans who have lived, grown
  up in or worked in Chinatown during the 1930s to 1960s, death houses bestir
  grim and depressing memories of the old two- to three- storey red-tiled roof
  houses that used to line Sago Lane, scattered intermittently among residential
  dwellings. "
