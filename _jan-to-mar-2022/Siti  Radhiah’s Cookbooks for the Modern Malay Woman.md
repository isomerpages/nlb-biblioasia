#### A number of cookbooks written in the 1940s and 1950s helped expand the traditional Malay culinary repertoire, as **Toffa Abdul Wahed** tells us.

The name Siti Radhiah Mohamed Saleh may not ring a bell to many, but she was one of the few female Malay cookbook authors whose works were produced and published in Singapore in the period between the end of World War II and independence in 1965.[^1] All in all, she wrote four cookbooks: Hidangan Melayu (Malay Dishes; 1948), Hidangan Wanita Sekarang (Dishes for Today’s Women; first printed in Jawi script in 1949 and reprinted three more times in Jawi before it was published in romanised Malay in 1961), Memilih Selera (Choosing Tastes; 1953) and Hidangan Kuih Moden (Modern Kuih Dishes; 1957).[^2]

These publications not only reflect Siti Radhiah’s modern attitude towards food and her advocacy of women’s education and progress, they were also a medium through which she could voice the importance of enlarging the scope of Malay literature so that it would serve the needs of women who were interested in domestic science.

#### **Early Life**

Siti Radhiah’s cookbooks do not provide much biographical information about her, and we do not know the year she was born. We can only surmise that she was likely born in Selangor. It is only in her second book, Hidangan Wanita Sekarang, that she was described as a graduate of Selangor Malay School, a former teacher of Kuang Malay School in Selangor and the wife of Harun Aminurrashid who was also a writer.

Much of the information about Siti Radhiah in this essay has been gleaned from the biographies about her husband Harun Aminurrashid – who gained a reputation over time as a renowned educator, writer, editor, publisher and political activist from Singapore – whom she married in the 1930s.[^3] Together, they had 15 children. Siti Radhiah was once a teacher. She likely chose this career because there were not many options available to Malay women at the time. Her father, Mohamed Saleh, was the principal of Serendah Malay School in Selangor. 

In 1939, Siti Radhiah and her family moved to Brunei when Harun was transferred there as Superintendent of Education. He had in fact been banished there by the British colonial authorities for his nationalist teachings as a teacher at the Sultan Idris Training College in Tanjung Malim, Perak.[^4] While in Brunei, Siti Radhiah lost her fifth child, and gave birth to her sixth and seventh children.[^5]  

When the British returned upon Japan’s surrender in 1945, Siti Radhiah’s husband was imprisoned without trial by the British Military Administration, the interim administrator of British Malaya, for 86 days as he was accused of colluding with the Japanese.  

During this time, Siti Radhiah and her children found refuge with the Kedayan, one of the indigenous peoples of Borneo. When her husband was later found not guilty, he was first offered a position as a member of the state executive council for Ulu Yam in Selangor, and then a teaching position in Singapore. He turned down both appointments as he had lost faith in the British colonial authorities and wanted nothing to do with them. In 1946, Siti Radhiah and her family moved to Singapore, where she
