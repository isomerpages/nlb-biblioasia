#### Executive Director of the National Book Development Council of Singapore _R Ramachandran_ gives a thoughtful and detailed review of _Paper Boat_ by Rajat Das.

#### **Introduction**

I just wish to comment on two aspects of the book:<br>  i) My experience of reading *Paper Boat*; and<br> ii)The significance of *Paper Boat* in Singapore’s publishing scene.

#### **Story Structure**

Writers basically adopt either one of two well-known story structures to tell their tales. One is the arc format that introduces the characters and provokes conflict, heightens tension and finally ends with resolution. The other is like a necklace in format along the arc — the main story line — on which hangs a series of independent side shows and stories. I think Rajat’s *Paper Boat* is like a necklace with lots of side stories that have potential to be developed into yet another series of novels.

#### **Paper Boat**

*Paper Boat*’s main story is centred on a fascinating couple — the strong and lovely Nalini and Romoni, the handsome, generous and forgiving gentleman par excellence — and their family, friends and neighbours within the larger community set in Bengal against an exotic period in Indian history — British India. It’s an epic family tale that runs into several generations.

It is a convincing tale of first love that is everlasting; though not consummated it is always smouldering, lingering and pining — a tale of generosity, kindness and sacrifice. It is a novel of successes and failures — the rise and fall of families and the British Empire. Rajat paints his vast array of characters vividly but all in good light. Even the cruel and crude, the shady and shameless are redeemed. Believe it or not, the masters — the British — conduct elegant, friendly and respectful conversations with their subordinates — the Indians.

If *Slumdog Millionaire* showed the seedy and seamy side of modern India, Rajat’s *Paper Boat* focuses on the elite of traditional India — the rich who live in huge bungalows, sipping Devonshire tea in the garden under the cool shade of the flame of the forest, engaging in intellectual conversations, venturing into the forest for an energising hunt, travelling in horse carriages and buying only “Made in Great Britain” products.

#### **Fresh Viewpoint**

What I like most about the novel is that it is a tale of hope written in the belief that mankind is ultimately good and benign. I find this viewpoint refreshing in a world of fear, poverty and war, where tradition is breaking down and the foundation of society and its fundamentals are no longer held in awe and reverence.

When I completed the book I felt a sense of satisfaction of having travelled long into the core of British India and having delved deeply into the lives and minds of people living then. After the last page I was pining for more — and this is most striking in this long tale — there is a latent momentum, inherent suspense, a sense of mystery that pushes you on until completion. I strongly recommend this stimulating and wholesome novel to you.
