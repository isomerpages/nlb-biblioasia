When we reached the bottom of the ship, I looked around me astonished, astonished, astonished, and no words will suffice, for I saw the magic [<i>hikmat</i>] of those steam machines [<i>pesawat asap</i>]. Six to seven fathoms of space were taken up by them alone! And I saw several people wiping, sweeping, oiling and polishing the iron and brasswork until they gleamed like mirrors. I saw nothing rusty, rough or dented, everything was smooth and shiny.[^1]

                              — Munshi Abdullah, 1841                        


#### **Introduction**
When Munshi Abdullah (1796–1849) wrote the first Malay account of a steamship in 1841, he rendered a strange metal contraption of pipes, boilers and engines for his audience in terms and imagery they could understand. As the first Malay-authored work to be printed and commercially sold, <i>Cerita Kapal Asap</i> (The Tale of the Steamship) was part of a wider turning point in Malay history: from an era of sail and scribes, into the industrial
civilisation of steam and print.

This essay explores that transition as a mediated process, where a new Malay world was generated as much through reinvention from within as it was by external disruption, primarily European forces. It uses stories about travel to examine how Malays redefined the relationship between the local and foreign. As new technologies of transport and communication accelerated the integration of Southeast Asia into colonial empires, travel
became a means for Europeans to establish their authority over subjugated landscapes and peoples. Prolific studies have examined European travelogues, which began as adventurous accounts about the conquest of indigenous societies, and later reflected the rise in commercial tourism after the opening of the Suez Canal.[^2] The stock personalities, imagery and settings of Somerset Maugham and Isabella Bird, among many, portrayed
a distinctive colonial style that developed in British Malaya during the late 1800s. More importantly, their imaginative construction of space and place were arguments for European imperialism. As Lily Kong and Victor Savage noted, these works regularly featured the exotic peoples and lush tropics alternately feared and idealised, consistent with Edward Said and David Arnold’s influential theories considering the link between representation
and power.[^3]

Yet the writing of travelogues by local authors expands the range of what journeying and travel writing meant at this time. Namely, that it was not the sole preserve of Europeans who mapped and surveyed static places and cultures. These travelogues affirm the circulation of Asians who thrived despite, but also because of, colonial networks. Beyond being tools of imperialism, the industrial technologies of steam and print were, as James Gelvin and Nile Green argued, “enabling technologies” that allowed Muslim societies to redefine their worlds both materially and conceptually.[^4] Malays harnessed both, as members of the growing Asian-Islamic community of information and movement. Following Mark Frost, this essay seeks to further illustrate how the expansion of print and maritime communication allowed Malay literati “to explore, to imagine and to define” a modernising Asia.[^5] With increasing encounters with the unfamiliar, Malays wrote their own accounts to interpret a new world on their own terms. Malay travelogues remain an underused source to describe the
colonial encounter in the 19th-century Malay world.

This essay does not seek to establish the travelogue as a coherent generic form in the Malay world or trace its trajectory of development. The term “travelogue” as used here refers to travel narratives – produced either as singular texts or as episodes within longer accounts – which this essay adopts as an analytical device. While travelogues did not exist as a distinct Malay literary genre, the narrative forms of<i> hikayat</i> (prose sagas) and syair (poetic ballads) were replete with extended accounts of characters wandering and undertaking quests. These episodes of movement and discovery were often central to the structure of the plot, as in the case of <i>Hikayat Awang Sulung Merah Muda</i> (Tale of Awang Sulung Merah Muda), which ends with the hero prince’s triumphant return to his rightful kingdom and romantic union with his beloved. This trope drew upon Javanese literature, especially the tales of Panji that became widely popular in Malay areas. <i>Hikayat Cekel Waneng Pati</i> (Tale of Cekel Waneng Pati), one such Panji-inspired Malay tale, involves a protagonist performing various trials and journeys to win the hand of his love. Another source of inspiration for Malay travel writing was the Perso-Arabic Islamic tradition, which, as will be explored later, found rich expression in early modern works such as <i>Hikayat Hang Tuah</i> (Tale of Hang Tuah).

These incipient travel narratives provided inspiration for 19th-century Malay writers, who infused them with Enlightenment ideas in newer<i>hikayat</i> and <i>syair</i>, but also the first dedicated travelogues. All were written by political elites, or those privileged enough by close association, to undertake and record their journeys. They were all also impacted by the changed landscape of their time: in nearby Java, the aristocrat Purwalelana’s travelogue (the first of its kind in Javanese) drew on the spiritual wanderings of earlier traditional tales while engaging with the colonial reality of the Cultivation System and the Great Post Road.[^6]

In the 19th century, the Malay world’s maritime ecology of port
kingdoms was displaced by territorial colonial states. The scribe Ahmad Rijaluddin (1770–c. 1811) would have been a teenager when English official Francis Light acquired the island of Penang from the Sultan of Kedah in 1786. Thus began the creation of a British corridor in the Melaka Straits, with Melaka – a Malay emporium that passed over into Portuguese and later Dutch rule – and then Singapore coming under British control by 1824. For some, these “Straits Settlements” were oases: Munshi Abdullah
was glad to live under English laws that prevailed in his native Melaka and adoptive Singapore, where he worked for most of his adulthood and witnessed the arrival of Western medicines and machines. The Settlements later became beachheads for landward expansion into the peninsular Malay kingdoms, as increasing involvement in their internal crises culminated
in the “Forward Movement” of the late 19th century that created
“British Malaya”.

Yet the colonial advance was uneven and gradual, with the Malay
polities refashioning themselves and resisting in different ways, as the lives and accounts of the travelogue authors show. In Johor on the southern end of the Malay Peninsula, the Anglophile ruler Abu Bakar (1833–95) and his ministers built an administrative state drawing inspiration from not just Europe but also Meiji Japan and the Ottoman Empire. Munshi Abdullah’s son Ibrahim Munshi (1840–1904) and his student Salleh Bin Perang (1841–1915) were key figures in Abu Bakar’s government. South of Singapore, the
kingdom of Riau, which had been sundered from the Malay Peninsula by the 1824 Anglo-Dutch Treaty, brought itself closer to a burgeoning global Islamic network. While a protectorate of the Netherlands, it developed itself into a centre for Muslim learning where the court scholar Raja Ali Haji (1809–73) enjoyed frequent interaction with literati circulating between the Malay Archipelago and the Arab lands.

Set against these shifting power relations, the authors and their works expressed a range of identities and imaginaries that presented themselves for a remade Malay world. Munshi Abdullah’s two travelogues, one detailing his voyage from Singapore up the east coast of the Malay Peninsula, and a second across the Indian Ocean to Arabia, form part of his corpus as the
so-called father of modern Malay literature.[^7] But what their works more uniformly represent is the wider programme of modernist reform that Asian and Islamic societies initiated to meet the challenge of European expansion. As English-educated officials, Ibrahim and Salleh represented exposure to an intellectual culture foreign to the Malay world, based on printed books instead of manuscripts and oral accounts. Similar to the modernist reform projects undertaken by other non-European leaders, their works, like Abdullah’s, reproduced an Enlightenment-based notion of an
“advanced” society. This consisted of, among others, the sense of a growing gap between the past and the present, the notion of an “old” world in retreat before the “new”. This modernism was not easily mapped onto trajectories of secularisation; as Raja Ali Haji demonstrated, it also entailed the imposition of stricter textualist interpretations of Islam as an antidote to the decline resulting from folk Islam’s supposed laxity.

Far from being mere spectators and students of Eurocentric modernity, these Malay authors were experiencing and developing their own forms of worldliness and connectedness. How they described their encounters with, and tried to understand, unfamiliar places, people and objects, were rooted in earlier Malayo-Islamic conventions of travel narrative. Ahmad’s
1810 <i>Hikayat Perintah Negeri Benggala</i> (Tale of the Government of Bengal) and Raja Ali Haji’s <i>Tuhfat Al-Nafis</i> (The Precious Gift), completed in 1866, both documented the rise of colonial cities using the language of traditional romance and conventions of the rihla, a genre of travel writing in Islamic
literature. Ibrahim’s <i>Kisah Pelayaran</i> (Story of a Voyage), written in 1871–72, painted the old Malay world in twilight: mines and plantations opening it further to global capitalism, and displacing an entrepot-based economic pattern dominated by locally assimilated communities. His capacity to move between these worlds contrasts against his father’s caustic rancour towards the old Malay order. Salleh Bin Perang’s <i>Tarikh Dato Bentara Luar</i> (History of the Dato Bentara Luar) chronicled his 1883 journey with Abu Bakar to Japan. While crossing the South China Sea, Salleh conceived the ocean space as a site of observation in line with Victorian empiricism, but retained
Islamic cosmologies presenting natural phenomena as manifestations of divine will.

These continuities upset the canonical periodisation of Malay
intellectual history into the deceptively neat categories of “traditional”, “transitional” and “modern”. Instead of finding departure points or  clear delineations, this essay explores how the Malay world’s endogenous knowledge systems interacted with imperial modalities to create an embedded modernity. That the authors drew on a confluence of traditions to talk about their place in this new interconnected world reflects what Tim Harper termed “many traditions of thinking and acting globally” that
coexisted in the 19th century.[^8] Their journeys, both within and beyond the Malay world, defied the parameters that Europeans attempted to set, not just in surveys, maps and museums, but in travel writing as well: the idea of Malaya as a fixed territory, a destination to be visited rather than a dynamic node making autonomous links to the outside world.[^9]

This essay by no means catalogues all 19th-century Malay travel writing. Among the unexplored works are major poetic travelogues: <i>Syair Peri Tuan Raffles Pergi Ke Minangkabau</i> (Ballad of Sir Raffles Going to Minangkabau;
1818), recounting Stamford Raffles’s expedition to the Minangkabau
Highlands; <i>Syair Kisah Engku Puteri</i> (Ballad of the Story of Engku Puteri;
1831), concerning the voyages of the Riau queen-consort Engku Puteri
Raja Hamidah; and <i>Syair Perjalanan Sultan Lingga Dan Yang Dipertuan
Riau Pergi Ke Singapura</i> (Ballad of the Journey of the Sultan of Lingga and
Viceroy of Riau to Singapore; 1891), which records a visit by the last Sultan
of Riau-Lingga to Singapore by Khalid Hitam Bin Raja Hasan al-Haji. All
these <i>syair</i>, written at different junctures of the 19th century, were of the
so-called “traditional” style, which again complicates a neat narrative of
literary “modernisation”.

That said, this essay’s study of the five authors mentioned – Ahmad
Rijaluddin, Raja Ali Haji, Munshi Abdullah and his son Muhammed
Ibrahim Munshi, and Salleh Bin Perang – nonetheless explores how the
Malayo-Islamic world’s local modes and meanings of travel did change. It is structured around three main themes. The first is the colonial city, a site
of new forms of social and cultural interaction, and which constituted the
centre of different networks of trade and politics displacing those of the
royal <i>negeri</i>. Introducing a temporal dimension to travel is the organised
society, which Malays living in cities representing a modernist future began
to identify with, against the “old” Malay regimes. Lastly, I examine the
authors’ adoption of a scientific gaze over physical environments, especially
the ocean, which had become a much busier arena of movement in the 19th
century than ever before.

#### **The City: Pleasure Gardens and Street Shows**
The colonial city redefined the maritime ecology of the Indian Ocean realm
with its commercial reach and military capacity. A sophisticated urban
culture had thrived for centuries in the Malay world by the 18th century,
comprising local port-polities, called <i>negeri</i>, and European castle-towns.
While these were economic and cultural centres, few matched the colonial
city in size, population and activity. This section explores accounts of two
such sites: British Calcutta and Dutch Batavia, where Ahmad Rijaluddin
and Raja Ali Haji wrote about the strangeness, disorientation and
fascination they experienced.

When Ahmad Rijaluddin was born in 1770, European-ruled ports
participated in the indigenous state system, adopting Malay codes of
diplomacy and commerce to engage local powers. As penmanship was an
uncommon skill, scribes and interpreters occupied a privileged position
as political intermediaries. Ahmad had access to literacy as his father, the
trader and judge Long Fakir Kandu, was an influential Tamil Muslim with
ties to the court of Kedah.[^10] This elite pedigree made possible Ahmad’s and
his brother Ibrahim Kandu’s employment as scribes to Penang’s leading
officials and merchants.

Raja Ali Haji, on the other hand, had a different vocation: he was
a prince of the Malay principality Riau, rather than a member of the
mercantile elite. His Bugis ancestors had migrated from Sulawesi to the
Melaka Straits in the 17th century, becoming traders and kingmakers of
the negeri there. Riau’s eminence as an economic and intellectual centre
enabled his frequent interaction with European and Malay statesmen from neighbouring polities, as well as scholars from the Islamic heartlands. Like
Ahmad Rijaluddin, he was well versed in the conventions of Islamic letters
likely imparted by the traditional education that men of their class received.

The <i>Hikayat Perintah Negeri Benggala</i> (Tale of the Government of
Bengal) was a product of such learning. Completed in 1811, it followed
Ahmad’s visit to Calcutta together with his employer, Robert Scott of the
Penang trading firm Forbes and Scott. Like earlier Malay romances, Ahmad
did not describe the voyage across the Bay of Bengal, but his impressions
upon arrival were colourful and evocative. He captured the bustle of
Calcutta’s harbour, the ships “without stopping in the day and night, come
and go in their thousands… too many to count”.[^11] From there he described
the settlements along the great Hooghly, which was so long that the journey
to its source would take years, and “nobody has ever reached it or knows
how far it is”.[^12] Ahmad’s Calcutta was bigger, busier and noisier than the
towns his audience in the Malay ports would have known, a city with
thousands of streets and fine mansions.

Displaying familiarity with the Malayo-Javanese epic tradition, Ahmad
made his characters recite <i>pantun</i>[^13] and compared Calcutta’s pleasure
gardens and stylish residents to figures and places from the Panji tales.[^14]
More noteworthy, however, are his inspirations from the <i>rihla</i>, typically
set in Islamic lands but also occasionally the exotic heathen realms beyond
it. A classic example was produced by the renowned 14th-century traveller
Ibn Battuta. <i>Rihla</i> encompassed “the believable and incredible”, balancing
“the niceties of everyday life” with “the Adja’ib or marvels”.[^15] Ahmad’s
descriptions likewise documented a wide range of activity, both banal and
unusual, elevated through the <i>rihla</i>’s aesthetic preoccupation with wonder.
He turned the gaze back to more than just Europeans: Arab <i>rihla</i> accounts
of Southeast Asia had presented it as a strange and exotic place as well.
Among the “various marvellous sights” (<i>serba termasa yang ajaib-ajaib</i>) that
Ahmad saw were Calcutta’s grand bazaars and their curious wares, as well as public performers executing fabulous displays: puppeteers, conjurers and
acrobatic dancers.[^16]

While Cyril Skinner has considered Ahmad’s repetitiveness as evidence
of a lack of creative talent, repetition was key in evoking the sense of
excess associated with the <i>rihla</i> convention. This mode of enumerating
myriad spectacles (<i>termasa</i>, from the Persian <i>tamasha</i>, “to behold”) was well
established in Malay palace literature, notably in the <i>Hikayat Hang Tuah</i>.
The protagonist of this 17th-century hero epic travelled to Constantinople
as a diplomatic emissary of Melaka. Yet, as Hang Tuah declared, the trip
also involved “the duty of bringing back news of the peculiar and exotic
to Melaka”,[^17] with the embassy encountering an inexhaustible series of
extraordinary sights, each lavishly described for the tale’s listeners.

Raja Ali Haji similarly emphasised the “peculiar and exotic” in his
account of a separate diplomatic mission, to Batavia in 1823. The account
forms a small episode in the encyclopaedic history that Raja Ali Haji
composed, entitled <i>Tuhfat Al-Nafis</i> (The Precious Gift), encompassing two
centuries of events centred on Riau. Virginia Hooker positioned Raja Ali
Haji as a Malay chronicler concerned with factual accuracy, synthesising
and evaluating sources, and supplying dates to events.[^18] However, the work
conforms to the courtly style of Malay (and Islamic) historiography in its
structure and language. Arabisms scattered in the text display his Arabic
erudition. While <i>Tuhfat al-Nafis</i> seems “modern” for its presentation of a
verifiable narrative, it resembles earlier Islamic histories, which were full of
dates and sources.

The Batavia account was likely supplied by Raja Ali Haji’s father,
Raja Ahmad, who led the mission together with other Riau officials.
After nearly two centuries of rule by the Dutch East India Company
(Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie; VOC), and futile attempts by past
governors to transplant the culture and values of the Netherlands to a
locally assimilated port-city, the old capital of Dutch Java entered a different
phase of European rule. The British Interregnum (1811–16) initiated reforms
sharpening distinctions between Dutch, part-Asian and Asian residents, and
diminished the city’s isolation with European emigration. This new concept of administration, based on the racist ideas of post-Napoleonic Europe, was
continued by the returning Dutch government of Herman Daendels. By
the time of Raja Ali Haji’s account, Batavia’s “Indies style” had given way to
features of European bourgeois society.

It posed a significant culture shock to the Malay embassy. At a banquet,
the <i>Tuhfat</i> emphasised how all the Dutch dignitaries sat on chairs as they
ate. Its narrator marvelled at the sheer gastronomic variety, not knowing
“how many times the plates were replaced or how many times foods
of different types and taste appeared!”[^19] The foreignness of “beautiful”
European music played on Waterlooplein was evident in the effort with
which the author described it for a Malay audience. He relied on visual
resemblances, comparing the wind instruments to their closest Malay
siblings: the <i>seruling</i> (bamboo flute), <i>serunai</i> (reed-pipe) and <i>nafiri</i> (royal
trumpet).[^20] While a contemporary reader may quickly identify what
“pushed and pulled” as likely a trombone, it is harder to confirm what
looked “like quivering rice hanging and rattling, ringing when beaten”.[^21]

What the <i>Tuhfat</i> shares with the colonial travelogue is an emphasis on
foreignness, by focusing on the peculiarity of everyday objects and practices.
In defamiliarising European life, the <i>Tuhfat</i> can be read as countering the
Othering voice of the colonial author. Raja Ali Haji’s attunement to cultural
difference often served to glorify Malayo-Islamic kingship and customs,
most prominently in his romanticisation of Raja Haji Fisabilillah (1727–84),
the fourth Yang Dipertuan Muda (viceroy) of Johor famously martyred in
battle against the Dutch. Yet in the Batavia episode, difference is approached
not with derision but curiosity and often amazement.

The <i>aja’ib</i> (wonder) topos recurs, for just as Calcutta’s entertainments
impressed Ahmad Rijaluddin, so did Dutch theatre in Batavia dazzle
the Malay envoys. However, <i>aja’ib</i> was also a vehicle for exploration
and learning. As Lara Harb notes, <i>aja’ib</i> was at once emotional but also
cognitive.[^22] Inherent in the feeling of awe at God’s creations was the desire
to know and understand them, through which the observer came closer to piety.[^23] The <i>Tuhfat</i> simultaneously marvelled at the sheer mass of people
arriving in “hundreds of carriages”, but also came upon an alternate social
reality where “men and women were seen sitting together”.[^24] It documented
the architecture of the playhouse where “<i>wayang komidi</i>” was performed,
with its tiered and fixed seating. The special effects of “ships entering, rain,
thunder, battles and other wonders [<i>aja’ib</i>]” were “marvellous”, but so too
were the lush stage sets which depicted nature so accurately that “they
appeared real”.[^25]

In drawing on an Islamic aesthetic tradition of wonder to capture the
variety and excitement of the colonial city, Ahmad Rijaluddin and Raja Ali
Haji embodied the encounter between two patterns of life in the Malay
world that became increasingly contentious in the 19th century. Coded
in their writing was a <i>negeri</i>-centred Malay cosmopolitanism, connected
to Islamic networks of culture and learning, which brushed against a
burgeoning network of European imperialism, centred on ocean portcities
like Calcutta and Batavia. The former had become the capital of
British India with a large subcontinental hinterland, while the latter, now
occupied by a colonial regime no longer playing by indigenous terms of
engagement, would have felt different to Riau embassies used to dealing
with the VOC old hands. Public entertainment was, in fact, a microcosm
for this social restructuring in space: theatre, as a European entertainment
supposing equality between audiences and performers, had far-reaching
consequences for Indies life.[^26] According to Jean Gelman Taylor, it differed
from the traditional amusements of “Indies households”, performed for
elite families together with their Asian servants “at a discreet distance”.[^27]
The public life of mixed-gender seating, traffic congestion and outdoor
symphonies diverged from the segregated and cloistered living of VOC
Batavia.[^28] Despite its geographical proximity to Riau, colonial Batavia felt
more foreign than Mecca, which is described in the <i>Tuhfat</i>’s account of aja
Ahmad’s pilgrimage.

#### **Organised Society: Production and Improvement**
Such cities inspired Malay elites to think about reorganising their
own societies, as they assimilated European notions of administrative
government, productivity and capital, and identified against traditional
forms of social and political organisation. For Munshi Abdullah and his
son Muhammed Ibrahim Munshi, the British Straits Settlements formed
a dimension apart from the neighbouring Malay kingdoms that were
still independent. But capital, production and bureaucracy would not be
confined there for long. The father’s and son’s travels through the Malay
Peninsula recorded the emanation of those commercial and political forces,
displacing a traditional feudal order.
Munshi Abdullah had much in common with Ahmad Rijaluddin, both
being Malay-speaking townsfolk of Tamil ancestry. Their mixed cultural
pedigree as Peranakan Negeri (local-born) resulted from established patterns
of migration and assimilation into Malay society through foreign–local
unions. They also shared elite parentage: Abdullah’s father was an
interpreter and secretary for Melaka’s Dutch governor. When the British
took over Melaka following the Napoleonic Wars, and later Singapore,
Abdullah also became a secretary and Malay tutor for the Straits’ new
European power.

Generations of scholars emphasised Abdullah’s realism and individuality
in making him the first modern Malay writer. Despite his strong personal
voice and style, commentators like Amin Sweeney have complicated
this image by arguing that Abdullah drew extensively on traditional
Malay literary conventions. Furthermore, intellectual biographies akin to
Abdullah’s were numerous in Islamic letters, and the individual as narrative
subject predates Abdullah: he himself extolled an 18th-century (Britishcommissioned)
biography, <i>Hikayat Nakhoda Muda</i> (The Tale of the Young
Mariner) as an exemplary piece of Malay literature.[^29] What Abdullah
introduced was the ethos and outlook of Enlightenment modernity, with its
subjection of human society to order, reason and progress.

Consequently, he subjected the places he visited to those standards,
becoming the progenitor of an enduring discourse on retrograde Malay
ideas and their need for reform. His 1838 journey to the east coast kingdoms
of Kelantan, Terengganu and Pahang was recounted in <i>Kisah Pelayaran Abdullah Ke Kelantan</i> (The Tale of Abdullah’s Voyage to Kelantan).
Abdullah was an interpreter negotiating the release of a Singapore vessel
and its merchandise from the ruler of Kelantan, then in civil strife. These
were not isolated areas, although the peninsula’s central dividing mountains
prevented overland journeys from the Straits towns. Abdullah’s account
records the merchandise shipped from their ports, suggesting active trade
links. Nevertheless, he described the east coast as alien and dangerous:
pirate-infested, untamed and closed off from European contact.

The apparently squalid and lawless east coast states were a far cry from
the organised life Abdullah knew in British Singapore. Pahang, which had
“no shops or marketplaces”, was so badly governed it was being reclaimed
by the wilderness.[^30] Kelantan’s poor sanitation and cleanliness reflected its
primitivity.[^31] Abdullah made ordinary Malays, whom he called “negligent
and idle”,[^32] the target of his industrial bias. In Terengganu, he chastised
children left to play all day “without education or work”.[^33] To him, these
exemplified aristocratic misrule, undisciplined and unorganised around
productive activity.

Abdullah’s own mention of Malays in these parts enjoying luxuries,
like fine clothes, however, makes us question his generalisations. As an
interpretive account, the travelogue is perhaps more insightfully read as
his evaluation of two distinct political systems. On the east coast were
courtly <i>negeri</i> where authority was given meaning and form through the
enactment of difference according to rank and lineage. In Singapore, the
state functioned as lawmaker and civic administrator, setting the realm in
order and stimulating trade. In ridiculing the sumptuary laws Malay rulers
imposed on commoners – while their towns were disorderly, overgrown and
filthy – Abdullah asserted good administration as the agenda and moral
purpose of political authority.

Despite being a messenger of British and Eurocentric modernity,
however, Abdullah’s liberal critique is innovative for its articulation in
Islamic terms. Malay nationalists excoriated Abdullah for identifying
himself with “the customs of the English”.[^34] Nevertheless, Abdullah performed these “customs”, by which he meant having “the license to
criticise the improper conduct of kings without being executed or seized”,[^35]
using arguments from the familiar Islamic political tradition. Abdullah
modelled his counsel for the Malay kings after the “mirrors for princes”,
manuals for statecraft common across the Islamic world. The 11th-century
<i>Siyasatnama</i> of Nizam al-Mulk was an especially famous example.
Abdullah staged his expositions through interactions with locals.
He boasted of an “easy and free” life under egalitarian British rule to a
Kelantan commoner, where one “lived like a king, and we can sit with
kings”.[^36] An exchange with an official, Tengku Temena, allowed Abdullah
to give sermons on the merits of liberal government in line with Islamic
injunctions. “Evil customs” bedevilling Malay society, such as smoking
opium, were “forbidden in Islam”.[^37] When the Tengku told him to ignore
the commoners’ complaints about Malay tyranny, Abdullah reminded the
Tengku that unjust kings would be the first to enter Hell.[^38] He implored
all rulers to read the <i>Taj as-Salatin</i> (Crown of Kings), a 17th-century Malay
“mirror for princes” from Aceh, to cultivate themselves as righteous leaders
who earn God’s mandate.[^39]

Abdullah’s rhetoric set a crucial precedent in Malay thought, combining
Enlightenment liberalism with Islamic statecraft to produce a modernist
Islamic politics. He shared much in common with other 19th-century
Muslim scholars who encountered European modernity such as Rifa’a
at-Tahtawi and Ahmad Faris al-Shidyaq, widening the field of Islamic
reformism in this period beyond the Nahda (Awakening) movement,
which saw Muslim societies receiving modernist inspiration primarily
through Arab-European connections. Abdullah’s ideas about what gave
Europeans their power – the responsible government consistent with Islamic
teachings – would be echoed by the Kaum Muda, a later generation of
Malay religious literati calling for political and social reform in the early
20th century.

Abdullah’s son Ibrahim Munshi in many ways continued his father’s
ideological legacy. Ibrahim was an official of Johor, a Malay kingdom neighbouring Singapore that, with its plantation economy and efficient
administration, was the last to accept British protection. Abdullah himself
taught numerous Johor ministers educated in Singapore’s Anglo-Malay
missionary school, where the state’s reformist ruler Abu Bakar studied.
British reports praised Abu Bakar’s capital Johor Bahru as a tidy little town
with clean streets. Its 1893 constitution, and adoption of the Ottoman civil
code that same year, represented the formalisation of government and Islam
within the state machinery. It would have won Abdullah’s approval.

Ibrahim’s journeys between 1871 and 1872 intersected with more direct
colonial intervention in the Native States, whose internal conflicts disturbed
British economic interests. He travelled to manage Johor’s outlying
territories and to interpret for British delegations, reflecting his capacity
to inhabit multiple worlds. Tim Harper called his account “a quietly
troubled picture of an old world on the turn”, with Ibrahim describing
Malaya’s integration into a global capitalist network, “a tale of tin, tax
and land title”.[^40] Roads and police stations disciplined the landscape,
while Singapore’s comfortable amenities ranked it first in Ibrahim’s list of
exemplary towns.[^41] Penang’s exciting street entertainment recalled Ahmad
Rijaluddin’s descriptions of Calcutta, precursors to the Asian mass culture
industries of the 20th century.[^42] Yet the more light-hearted scenes – of
Ibrahim’s companions spinning narrative yarns, or of his father’s old friends
reminiscing happier days – anchor these sweeping changes to the quotidian
as well.[^43] 

Ibrahim clearly inherited Abdullah’s capitalist bias against the Malays
as “lazy natives”. Even the Malays of Melaka, commercial cultivators
participating in the town’s economy, were “the noblest” of their race only
because of their industriousness.[^44] Elsewhere, local resistance to “the white
man’s custom” of having land grants was a sign of Malay “stupidity”,[^45] even
though the tenure system subjecting them to regular taxation disrupted
the mobile pattern that afforded Malay planters flexibility and freedom.
He likewise recorded the flows of produce in and out of ports along the Malayan west coast, albeit now in volumetric units. Unlike his father,
however, Ibrahim was actively remaking this landscape, through his
political position. In resolving disputes and drawing up contracts between
Chinese planters, his scribal procedures diverged from those of Malay court
penmen.[^46] Instead of producing ceremonial documents signifying the royal
person, Ibrahim made and stored copies, part of the paperwork bureaucracy
defining Johor as a new Malay polity. This created a depersonalised,
bureaucratic government detached from the raja’s charismatic power.

Visiting Klang in 1872, the headquarters of chiefs Syed Zain and Tengku
Ziauddin engaged in the wider Selangor Civil War, Ibrahim described a
Malay government bent on public improvement. A town plan was drawn up
for roads and civic buildings including assembly houses, police stations and
hospitals.[^47] As revenues poured in from the thriving tin trade with Melaka
that Tengku Ziauddin helped develop under his rule, this local polity set
itself in order, unlike the “messy” Terengganu that Abdullah saw decades
earlier. Ibrahim’s uniform, which Abu Bakar commanded he wore to display
his position as a member of “our government”, was noticed by Syed Zain,
who was also designing a seal and uniform to be made in Europe.[^48] The
Malay elites, therefore, were conscious of adopting the official trappings that
enabled them to lay claim to “modern” government.

Yet the effort must have seemed to Ibrahim a pale attempt to pursue
those Europeanising reforms that earned his state recognition. He was
unimpressed by the English names Syed Zain adopted for Klang’s streets,
imitating the Straits Settlements.[^49] More importantly, Syed Zain and
Tengku Ziauddin’s undisciplined military, commanded by European
drifters who failed to obtain Singapore appointments, revealed their
inability to organise a formidable challenge to British intervention.[^50] 
However, Ibrahim had a less adversarial relationship with these Malay
chiefs, unlike his father. Despite representing a progressive Malay leadership,
as Fadzil Othman observed, Ibrahim enjoyed the company of Malays with
refined traditional manners, such as Tengku Ziauddin.[^51] Ibrahim’s expansive belonging, encompassing multiple modes of kinship and community,
was not circumscribed by strict membership in either an “old” or “new”
Malay world.

Difference, however, came also in non-human forms, as travel
introduced Malays to new physical landscapes. This time of change was
also related to the environment: Ibrahim’s account can be read as the story
of an urbanised Malay for whom jungles were exotic, and who struggled
with drinking from silty streams and sleeping through mosquito-infested
evenings. His description of a geothermal spring[^52] is part of a proliferation
of Malay science-writing in the 19th century, mostly educational texts by
his father Abdullah intended for missionary schools, such as a geography
entitled <i>Hikayat Dunia</i> (The Tale of the World), a zoological guide called
<i>Hikayat Binatang</i> (The Tale of Animals) and <i>Chermin-mata Bagi Segala
Orang Yang Menuntut Pengetahuan</i> (An Eye Glass for All Who Seek
Knowledge), a quarterly magazine featuring subjects from economics to hotair
balloons. The next section focuses on two travelogues that paid particular
attention to the environment as a site of inquiry, reflecting an empirical view
of the world as a site of observation, description and measurement.

#### **Science Adventures: Crossing the Open Ocean**

While the maritime space featured prominently in the old Malay sagas,
the experience of being at sea itself was usually undescribed. The trope of
voyaging predominated in a society where wealth and state power depended
on maritime trade and control of vital sea lanes. But scribes and storytellers
often timed the characters’ journeys across water with approximate numbers
of days, or formulaic estimations like “seven days and seven nights”.[^53] Rare
descriptions of the ocean’s materiality were often accompanied by mystical
encounters. In the <i>Hikayat Hang Tuah</i>, for instance, sudden storms and
high waves attended the appearance of Nabi Khidir, an Islamic guardian
saint of the sea.[^54] The contraction of time and space typically associated
with the age of steam undergoes a reversal in the works of Munshi Abdullah
and Salleh Bin Perang, whose material conception of the world produced
slow and detailed observation.

Munshi Abdullah’s <i>Kisah Pelayaran Abdullah Ke Jeddah</i> (The Tale of
Abdullah’s Voyage to Jeddah) is an account of his pilgrimage to Mecca, but
as he died in the Holy City before the journey was completed, the voyage
from Singapore to Jeddah takes centre stage. Abdullah travelled on the
<i>Sabil al-Islam</i>, one of many Arab sailing vessels plying the Indian Ocean
between the Red Sea and the Malay Archipelago at the time, noting the
stark difference between the archipelago’s shallow and tranquil seas and
the tempestuous oceans beyond. Abdullah’s uneventful trip up the Melaka
Straits ended when they passed Penang and entered the Bay of Bengal,
where “the waves and swells were immense”.[^55] Like a mere “coconut husk”,
the <i>Sabil al-Islam</i> was “thrown about by the waves, floating and sinking”.[^56] 

Abdullah introduced not only an enlarged sense of oceanic space,
phenomenal and frightening, but also a new temporality that contrasts
with the old sagas’ <i>beberapa lama</i> (“after some time”). He logged the hour
whenever a weather event occurred or a new sight appeared, lending a
predictability to journeying itself. This clock-based chronology reflected
the enfolding of the Malay world into a universal regime of timekeeping.
A European time-structure, in standardising schedules for work and travel,
was central to the stability and homogenisation that facilitated imperial
commerce and administration across vast distances. Abdullah might have
seen shipping tables in the Singapore newspapers, which foreshadowed the
arrival of railway schedules in Malaya in the early 20th century.

As the <i>Sabil al-Islam</i> travelled from Ceylon to the Malabar coast and
on to the Hejaz, Abdullah described the ocean space with a meteorological
gaze. Torrential winds gushed “as if they were being poured down on us”.[^57] 
The colour of the water changed from “white as white can be” in the storms
off Ceylon to “green with corals visible underneath” in the Red Sea.[^58] The
air in some places was “clear and bright, and sometimes we would see the
rays of the sun”, despite the “unspeakable” strong waves and winds.[^59] 

Yet these elemental terrors were not for Abdullah entirely rational
processes, as they inspired reverence for the divine. Despite his diatribes
against “stupid” Malays whose superstition he blamed for their technological backwardness, his invocations of God upon witnessing the high waves off
Cape Comorin[^60] still suggest belief in an Islamic cosmological order wherein
a divine power governed natural events. Abdullah’s naturalistic observations
are replete with the topos of <i>aja’ib</i>, seen in his description of the island of
Socotra, whose “appearance was made by God as a wonder”, with “neither
a single blade of grass, let alone trees nor anything else upon it”.[^61] his
political beliefs, Abdullah’s approach to science reconciled Enlightenment
ideals with Islamic theology. Indeed, the mythical sea of Hang Tuah existed
still in traces of Abdullah’s account. Mentions of sacred sites to which
the passengers and crew paid tribute along the way, from Adam’s Peak to
mystics’ tombs, cast this maritime passage as an active spiritscape.

This diaristic, chronological and naturalistic approach to writing the
sea was adopted and developed further by Salleh Bin Perang, Abdullah’s
student. A Johor minister in Ibrahim’s cohort, Salleh’s tenure as chief
surveyor and cartographer was apparent in his keen eye for physical terrain.
Invited by his master Abu Bakar, Salleh joined a delegation bound for Meiji
Japan. This official diplomatic trip, consistent with the Maharaja’s pursuit of
international legitimacy, also satisfied Salleh’s fondness for travel.

The party left Singapore on the French steamer <i>Oxus</i> on 28 April 1883.[^62]
Along the way, Salleh recorded the names of islands the ship passed, their
shape, terrain and position in relation to the ship, as well as the people
who inhabited them (if any) and their principal occupations. In addition
to landmarks and weather, Salleh noted the date and time the ship passed
through specific channels, and its arrival at and departure from their stops
en route. Three hundred miles from Saigon, “the temperature changed and
it felt cool”, and “the sky also changed colour and took on a misty aspect”.[^63]
A “deliciously refreshing” rain quickly turned into a violent thunderstorm
inducing seasickness.[^64] Here, in contrast to summarised itineraries of
activities on shore, time at sea is marked by daily weather reports. The entry
for Tuesday, 8 May, two days after the <i>Oxus</i> left Hong Kong, documents
the changing wind speeds that led from cold swells in the morning to calmer breezes in the sunny afternoon.[^65] The following day’s entry records
the ship’s slow advance due to poor visibility in the fog from morning to
night, making the approach to Shanghai, with its sandbanks, especially
treacherous. Salleh still operated across calendrical systems, however, with
the appearance of the new moon that evening a reminder that it was “the
first day of the month of Rejab, 1300”.[^66]

Like Singapore, the three transit cities – Saigon, Hong Kong and
Shanghai – were now colonial ocean ports of the international steam
network. Infrastructures of communication, like a “telegraph station”
Salleh saw in the Shanghai harbour,[^67] signified their integration into an
electrified, global space. As at other international oases of imperialist
control, the Maharaja and his aides had access to familiar comforts and
elite pastimes: a succession of banquets at governors’ houses and billiard at gentlemen's clubs.

In expressive prose, Salleh painted lush seascapes: in the South China
Sea, distant “mountains on the mainland… loomed up and disappeared
one after another in the mist which pervaded everywhere”.[^68] Nigel
Philips argued that Salleh introduced a “picturesque” sensibility to Malay
nature writing, an appreciation of which he likely obtained from learning
Chinese ink painting.[^69] Much like a tourist, Salleh admired the “extremely
beautiful” scenery surrounding the Seto Inland Sea, with its high hills
above “narrow channels edged with white sand, interspersed with islands,
which are green and verdant”.[^70] But beyond aestheticising these physical
environments, Salleh also juxtaposed them with sites back home, making
the Malay world’s natural formations the standard of comparison. The
Nagasaki harbour, with its “beautiful green” hills, was “twice the size of
the Teluk Belanga channel”,[^71] thus accommodating what his Malay readers
knew first-hand as a guide.

On 20 May, the delegation arrived in Kobe and began their tour of
Japan’s cities, each bustling with jinrikishas, crowds and entertainment venues. The account takes us through the temples, theatres and boulevards
of Kyoto, Nara, Nagoya, Yokohama and finally Tokyo, where the Meiji
Emperor received Abu Bakar for a brief (and rather uneventful) audience
on 26 June. Salleh often summarised events in cursory sentences, and some
days are unreported altogether. On 30 August, the party departed Nagasaki
for the Pacific, and a week-long excursion up the Huangpu.

When a typhoon hit the party’s vessel, the P&amp;O steamer <i>Sutlej</i>, on their
return leg from Hong Kong, Salleh gave man-made technology a divine
origin, thus also subjecting it to divine whims and disposal: “All-Pure God,
who created a ship of this size, did not exempt it from being tossed about
by the waters.”[^72] The weather abated in the days leading to their arrival in
Singapore, and Salleh used the exact same phrase as his teacher Abdullah
to describe the calm sea: “placid as water in a tray”.[^73] With mathematical
precision, Salleh provided the <i>Sutlej</i>’s bearings at “8 degrees, 17 minutes
latitude by 108 degrees, 54 minutes longitude”.[^74] They berthed in Singapore
on 5 November to a welcome crowd of thousands.

As a Malay text, Salleh’s account is innovative in its presentation of
a measurable world. Space and time were experienced in legible units:
distances, dates, hours and observable natural phenomena. In addition, the
maritime world it depicts was no longer the dynastic space of traditional
Malay sagas, where courtly norms of hospitality governed relations between
port kingdoms and the voyagers who called at them. It was an imperial
space where European-ruled ocean-ports provided safe haven for princely
cosmopolitans like Abu Bakar and his retinue, given their adoption of
“civilised” government, law and culture. The <i>Hikayat Hang Tuah</i> is again
useful for comparison, as the eponymous hero in the traditional maritime
Malay world successfully forged Melaka’s alliances with foreign powers by
speaking the latter’s languages and participating in their local customs.[^75]
In contrast, Malay travellers of the high colonial period established
their legibility through universalised norms that signified proximity to
Eurocentric modernity, including the requisite scientific knowledge to move
through the technologised space of steam and electricity. Even so, as Charles Forsdick pointed out, mechanised movement did not inexorably result in
abstraction from one’s surroundings or disembodiment, but also sometimes
“deceleration” that “subverted the speed of mechanised transport” and
“disrupt[ed] the anticipated progress of the journey”.[^76]

Both Abdullah’s and Salleh’s travelogues prefigure the remapping of the
Malay world onto a global order where Japan and the Ottomans emerged
as the vanguard against growing European imperialism. The old route to
Mecca that Abdullah undertook was on the eve of subjection to a regime
of passports and visas that territorialised a historically fluid Islamic world.
Nevertheless, Mecca and Istanbul, which Abdullah did not survive to visit
despite his plans to, would become ever more central in the imaginary of
a growing solidarity spanning the global <i>ummah</i> (Islamic community).
Salleh’s journey in the opposite direction to Tokyo reflected a nascent
“Asian” regionalism under Japanese leadership, which Malay elites began
to see as another strategic bloc with which to identify themselves.[^77] These
routes were incipient connections that multiplied and solidified into the
pan-Islamic and pan-Asian awakenings of the early 20th century, through
which Malays contested the meanings of community and modernity. It is to
those notions that we now turn.

#### **Conclusion**

The travelogues discussed expand the meanings of being Malay through
changing times. As a mechanised period, the 19th century opened up the
world to Malays who ventured farther and faster away from home. Yet these
authors destabilised the teleological outcomes presupposed by dominant
narratives of Malay modernity, such as liberalism, rationalism, mass politics
and eventual nationhood. The colonial city was still viewed through the
lens of fantastical imagery and the topos of wonder. Political reform was
still advocated by appealing to Islamic doctrine, and with appreciation for
some traditional Malay modes of cultural and social interaction. Even an
empirical view of the world found room for older spirits, guardian entities
and divine intervention.

That local intellectual labour through translation and adaptation was
key to forging a modernity embedded in local circumstance is not news
to Southeast Asianists. Barbara Andaya, for instance, considers these
societies’ selective adoption of outside influences over centuries to express an
innately “modern” sensibility.[^78] The paradigm is echoed by Oliver Wolters:
Southeast Asia’s penchant for “making sense” – by organising its reality
with reference to past experience – helped it understand its place in wider
worlds.[^79] Travelogues have been studied as part of the field’s call to write
“autonomous history”, going back to the 1930s. Far from being “monologic”,
as Ben Murtagh argues in relation to Malay literature’s tendency to obscure
differences between locals and foreigners,[^80] Malay belonging was capacious
and expansive. Between the mid-19th and early 20th centuries, a regional
cosmopolitanism was fostered by the accelerated movement of Malay-speaking
peoples despite imperial control, as Joel Kahn noted. It defied the
notion of “a pre-modern Eastern society into which an already fully formed
Western modernity was inserted”.[^81]

These Malay travel accounts also subvert narratives of Islamic
modernity that highlight journeys by Arab thinkers to Europe as central
to the Nahda. In contrast to those metropolitan routes, Malay travelogues
recorded impressions of other colonised spaces, and engaged in a tradition
of selective stylistic adaptation reaching back well before the 19th century.
Like the earlier  <i>rihla </i> tales, they contained what Nabil Matar called “the
happy combination of piety and curiosity”.[^82] They expose our depleted
contemporary notions of the “Islamic”, understood now as a  <i>religious </i>
category taxonomised apart from its social entanglements, therefore
frequently associated in Malay literature with theological or ritual texts
but not “secular” narrative. The aesthetic and intellectual dimensions of
these travelogues were Islamic insofar as Islam exists, beyond prescriptive orthodoxy, as a system of “explorative meaning-making” that is made by
and consequential to the subjects who engage in it (i.e., Muslims).[^83]

While some of these writers, like Ibrahim Munshi, expressed their
sheer excitement at experiencing foreign destinations, the tone of the works
suggests they were not writing for pleasure or profit. As influential figures
in their respective societies, these authors had clear political and intellectual
agenda, which inflected their works. Contrary to colonial travel-writers,
they were not writing for a mass European public for whom the prospect of
commercial tourism increasingly became routine as the 19th century wore
on. Each of the Malay authors had a different audience in mind: Munshi
Abdullah was clearly prefiguring an emergent Malay literati and future mass
readership; Ahmad Rijaluddin produced a royal panegyric for his English
employers, just as Ibrahim and Salleh sought to proclaim Johor’s dramatic
transformation as the future of Malay society and government; Raja Ali
Haji’s  <i>Tuhfat </i> was likely meant for circulation within the Riau aristocracy
whose adherence to Malay customs and Islamic ethics – as his other works
also reflected – he was anxious to maintain.

These divergent audiences and objectives resonated down to the early
20th century, when Malayness came to be contested between the triple
axes of  <i>bangsa </i> (national community), royal subjecthood and membership
in the  <i>ummah </i>.[^84] The Ottoman collapse, which ended dreams of pan-
Islamic rejuvenation, further strengthened the  <i>bangsa </i> cause. Yet while the
racial nationalism of the 1920s may have circumscribed the range of Malay
identity, the world remained an arena to affirm its shape-shifting meanings.
Henk Maier, in reading  <i>Hang Tuah </i>, dwelt on its notion of “playing
relatives”, where “conversations rather than conclusions” maintain the
fluidity of Malayness.[^85] Performances of kinship held together an internally
diverse society distributed over a wide geographical span, making personal
negotiation between insiders and outsiders an enduring feature of Malay
life. Thus, even in the postwar period, when the  <i>bangsa </i> ideologue Harun
Aminurrashid wrote his prolific series of travelogues on Europe, the Middle East and Asia, his attempt to form a “post-imperial voice” through travel[^86]
resorted once more to locating difference and commonality at the level of
personal interaction and impressions. As Maier argued, the elusiveness of a
fixed and definite Malayness through foreign encounters endures.[^87] It was,
and is, as large and varied as the worlds it already contains.

7 Much has been made of Abdullah’s individualist authorial voice, and how his descriptions of “real” events, instead of fantastic elements, set him apart from traditional writers. His legacy is visible in the works of Ibrahim and Salleh, whose works reflected the formal education they received from Abdullah and his employers, the Protestant missionaries in British Singapore. At the same time, the prevailing trope of literary innovation based largely on these authors’ “realist” bent has been perhaps overplayed: the 18th-century texts _Hikayat Nakhoda Muda_ (Tale of the Young Mariner) and _Hikayat Tanah Hitu_ (Tale of the Land of Hitu), and going back slightly further, the 17th-century _Syair Perang Mengkasar_ (Ballad of the Makassar War), were all based on “factual” reports.
