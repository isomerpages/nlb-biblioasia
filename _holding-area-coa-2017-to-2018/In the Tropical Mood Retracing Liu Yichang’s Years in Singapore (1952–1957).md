#### **Introduction**
In 2000, a new generation was introduced to Hong Kong writer Liu
Yichang (刘以鬯, 7 December 1918 – 8 June 2018) through the technicoloursaturated
imagery of Wong Kar Wai’s *In the Mood* for Love and *2046*, two
films inspired by Liu’s seminal novels *Tête-bêche* (《对倒》) and *The Drinker*
(《酒徒》, which was considered the first stream-of-consciousness Chinese
novel) respectively. The films’ protagonist, a cigarette-puffing newspaper
editor and pulp-novelist played by actor Tony Leung, was also loosely based
on Liu himself.

Wong’s films may have been set in Hong Kong in the 1960s, but the prime
of Liu’s life had been a decade earlier in Singapore in the 1950s, where he,
aged 34, experienced the golden era of Singapore’s tabloids, was initiated
into the glitzy *getai* (歌台, live revue) world, fell in love with a beautiful
songstress and married a dancer with a beautiful heart.

The diasporic twinning of Hong Kong and Malaya due to political and
historical events of the time created a wealth of opportunities that prompted
the exchange of commerce, talents and culture. Malaya’s post-war demand
for Chinese talents in the publishing and entertainment industries had made
Liu’s, and his wife’s, brief stint in Malaya possible, thereby shaping his
personal and literary life forever.

In 1952, Liu was headhunted to join the high-profile but short-lived paper
*Ih Shih Pao* (益世报, ISP) in Singapore. He returned to Hong Kong in 1957,
ill and disillusioned, after several false starts at establishing his newspaper
career. From then on, Liu, as a novelist based in Hong Kong, continued
a long and prolific relationship with Singapore’s *Nanyang Siang Pau*,
publishing more than 60 Malayan short stories between 1958 and 1959,
followed by an unbroken serialisation of 55 novels from 1970 to 1985,
out of which three were set in Singapore.

On the occasion of his centenary, my paper retraces Liu’s Malayan years and
attempts to make sense of his life and time here through newspaper archives,
newly unearthed novels and published works, as well as interviews with his
wife and close friends in Singapore.

This paper examines the overlapping influence of the two distinct but
connected worlds that Liu Yichang inhabited in Singapore, specifically the
tabloid industry and *getai* inner circle, which led to the intertwining of the
two personas in his inner world, namely the “newspaper man” (报人, often
featured in his stories and novels) and the “storyteller who entertained the
public” (娱乐大众的小说家). A chronicler of mid-20th-century Singapore
society, Liu created a rich body of Malayan work that, though sadly neglected,
deserves to be preserved and celebrated as part of our cultural heritage.

#### **First Cut is the Deepest**

In June 1952, Liu Yichang had been living in a room on the fourth floor of
Nanyang Khek Community Guild (南洋客属总会) when he came to head
the *Fukan* (副刊, supplement) of the new Chinese newspaper, *Ih Shih Pao*.1
A 10-minute walk down Peck Seah Street, a left turn on Gopeng Street and a right turn took him to his office on Anson Road. He had arrived in
Singapore with four Hong Kong veteran editors, Chung Wen Ling
(钟文苓), Liu Wenqu (刘问渠), Zhao Shixun (赵世洵) and Zhang Bingzhi
(张冰之). Together, they were known as the Five Tigers from Hong Kong.
The newspaper was launched on 7 June 1952, and a well-attended cocktail
party was held at the Cathay Restaurant on 14 June. At the occasion were
the who’s who of Singapore – government officials, Chinese community
leaders and business organisation representatives.2 The paper’s future looked
promising. Liu Yichang did not expect to lose his first job in Singapore in
less than four months.

On 13 October 1952, *Nanyang Siang Pau* (NYSP) reported the abrupt closure
of Liu’s paper: “At 6am yesterday, *Ih Shih Pao* locked down its office and
posted a notice announcing the suspension of its operation.” The headline
read: “Three Years of Preparation and They Lasted Four Months”. Fortyseven
of the 120 workers were editorial staff and all had been locked out
of the building with their personal belongings still inside. Some journalists
only found out that they were out a job after they had returned from
their assignments.3

Liu should have seen it coming. The paper had already run into financial
difficulty barely a month after its launch, and, from mid-August, was unable
to pay its employees.4 Three editorial staff, including Zhao Shixun and Chin
Kah Chong (陈加昌, who joined Pan-Asia News Agency in 1955 and became
Singapore’s first Vietnam War correspondent), submitted a letter signed
by all staff to the labour office to seek recourse in recouping salaries and
severance pay owed to them.5

The exact dates and chronology of Liu’s movements during this time are
muddled. Liu’s biographer, Yi Mingshan (易明善), wrote that the paper had
run into dire financial difficulty by end July. Liu and his four Hong Kong
colleagues negotiated with the publisher and, failing to get him to sort out the finances, quit and left (“罢笔而去，离开《益世报》”). B.H. Tay, a
Singapore Chinese-newspaper historian, however, wrote that the editors had
merely gone on “strike” (实行“罢笔”).6 Yi also wrote that “After leaving *Ih
Shih Pao* by end July, Liu was welcome onboard [at] *Sin Lit Pau* (新力报) as
its chief editor”.7 But ISP’s assistant manager had told NYSP two days after
ISP’s shutdown that “they had notified immigration authorities to prohibit
the Hong Kong employees from staying in Singapore”,8 suggesting that Liu
and the other Hong Kong editors had still been in ISP’s employ until its
closure in October.

One can only imagine Liu’s devastation – the sudden shock of losing his
job, the anger at being unpaid for months (Liu was also battling his ex-wife
over alimony during this time9), and being told that he could no longer stay
in Singapore. A *Lianhe Zaobao* write up on ISP’s rout quoted a line from
Liu’s story “Old Wong” (老王): “It was a weekend afternoon. I walked to
work and was shocked to see the news centre’s door tightly shut…it felt like
someone had punched me in the stomach…everything around me suddenly
lost its balance”.10

The unfortunate debacle at ISP was to set the tone for Liu’s news career in
Malaya over the next six years, playing out against the exciting but volatile
backdrop of the 1950s Chinese tabloid boom. This tide had brought Liu to
Singapore’s shores, but it would also slosh him around from paper to paper.
In Liu’s words, “It was hard for tabloids to survive. After one collapsed,
another one would soon be set up, but it wouldn’t be long before it also
went down”.11

#### **The Tabloid Boom**
The decade of the tabloid boom up until 1959 saw the publication and
subsequent demise of over 40 tabloids due to declining readership, financial
difficulties and poor management.12 The tabloid boom also coincided with
the Malayan Emergency, a period that saw the government frequently
banning publications for politically subversive content or shutting them
down as a result of the Anti-Yellow Culture Movement. Liu, who had
worked for up to 10 tabloids, bore witness to the heady rise and fall of this
golden age of tabloid publishing. After ISP, Liu briefly worked as the chief
editor for *Sin Lit Pau* before he was poached by *Lien Pang Daily News*
(《联邦日报》) to head the paper in Kuala Lumpur in 1953.13

Although virtually nothing has been written about Liu’s brief stay in Kuala
Lumpur, *Popular Melodies* (《时代曲》), Liu’s thinly-veiled *roman à clef* (that
has not been read since the end of its serialisation in NYSP in 1971) helps
plug the gap. *Popular Melodies*’ narrator, Zhu Shangren (诸尚仁), bears an
uncanny resemblance to Liu. Like Liu, Zhu had also come to Malaya from
Hong Kong to work for a newspaper that had quickly folded, causing him
to move from one paper to another. Zhu’s response on how he ended up
in KL could have been words spoken by Liu himself: “The newspaper I was
working for was going through financial difficulties. I had wanted to go
back to Hong Kong. It so happened that this paper in Kuala Lumpur was
restructuring, and the person in charge came to Singapore to put together
a new team. That’s how I ended up here”.14 Eventually, Zhu was given the
opportunity to head another tabloid back in Singapore, and he took up
the offer even though “the paper treats me well here, but life here is too
monotonous. Singapore would suit me better. As a city, Singapore is more
vibrant than Kuala Lumpur”.15

In a 2016 interview, Liu provided behind-the-scenes insight into the tabloid
newsroom: “I took a train to Kuala Lumpur, and when I first arrived at
*Lien Pang Daily News*, I realised that they didn’t even have a proofreader.

I had to do all the editing, proofreading and layout, from first to last page,
all by myself”.16 “Small Papers” (referencing the Chinese term for tabloids)
summed up the scale of their set-ups, which required everyone, including
the editors, to wear multiple hats. While in Singapore, Liu befriended the
famous Singapore calligrapher and writer Chua Boon Hean (蔡文玄, whose
pseudonym was Liu Beian (柳北岸)), and often played mahjong at his home.
Chua’s son, Chua Lam, a famous Hong Kong columnist, recalled: “It was a
pleasure watching [Liu] play mahjong. When the paper called in the middle
of their mahjong sessions, he would ask me to set up a side table with
writing papers. He treated it like a sewing machine, churning out the articles
while he was waiting for the other players to discard their tiles”.17

Back in Singapore, Liu worked for two papers chaired by the Kuala
Lumpur construction tycoon Low Yat (刘西蝶). Liu was the supervising
editor at *Chung Shing Jit Pao* (《中兴日报》, CSJP) at 110 Robinson Road.
The broadsheet struggled with its declining readership and often ran into
financial difficulties. Liu later became editor and writer at the tabloid *Feng
Bao* (《 锋报》, FB), which was launched in 1953. Chen Mingzong, his friend
and former colleague at ISP, was its chief editor. With its smaller set-up,
FB’s sales and distribution thrived. It had a high circulation of 20,000
copies, and was crowned the King of the Tabloid (小报王). Liu left soon after
its inception, but was rehired in 1954.18

Tabloids of this era were all very competitive, with each vying for its niche
audience. Some specialised in entertainment news. The Shaw Brothers film
studio published *Entertainment News* (《娱乐报》) to promote its films and
stars, while *Happy News* was one of the many tabloids that reported on the
latest *geta*i news, their songstresses and cabaret girls. Some tabloids took
a salacious approach, running pornographic stories and visuals to attract
a certain demographic. But not all tabloids were fluff. Some specialised in
news from communist China during the Cold War, while others like FB
specialised in the exposé of corrupt and illegal activities.19 For Liu, working for such a paper was not without thrill and danger. Soon after its launch,
FB exposed an illegal gambling ring in Kuala Lumpur that specialised in
*tse fa* (字花). The crime lord threatened to hurl hand grenades into the FB newsroom, but the paper would not back down, and eventually helped the police crush the organisation.20

Despite enjoying increasing sales, FB was banned on 30 September 1955 by
the Malayan government for posing a risk to public security.21 Liu then
moved to *Life News* (《生活报》), a new publication launched by the FB
team on 25 October 1955, followed by *Shieh Pau* (《狮报》) in September
1956. On 24 December 1955, Chen Mingzong, FB’s former chief editor
launched a new tabloid *Ti Press* (《铁报》) with his brother Chen Qing
(陈清), and Liu became its chief writer. *Ti Press* invested a great deal
of money in its high-quality tritone printing, which gave its images
greater tonal range. Unfortunately, *Ti Press*’ sales and distribution were
disappointing and Liu left when the paper reverted to the economical
black-and-white duotone printing for its ninth issue. Interestingly, the
paper’s sales picked up under a new editorial team. In March 1956, when
Hong Kong movie superstar Li Lihua came to Singapore for the location
shoot of the film *Rain Storm in Kreta Ayer* (风雨牛车水) which opened on
18 September 1956), *Ti Press* ran daily behind-the-scenes reports, which
resulted in soaring sales. About a year later, *Kang Pao* (《钢报》) was
launched on 17 November 1956 with Liu as its chief editor, but he left
after three issues.22

#### **Fighting a Lost Cause?**
Despite the distressing instability of his job, one thing remained constant
for Liu: his love for literature and his quest to promote modern literature
through the papers. Liu had always been or doubled up as the editor of
the *Fukan* literary section, a unique platform in Chinese newspapers that
had been instrumental in shaping the identity of Malayan – and after
Singapore’s departure from the Federation of Malaysia – Malaysian and
Singaporean Chinese literature. Liu was undoubtedly the best choice for
such a role, as he had been editing literature for a decade before he came to Singapore. In his birth place of Shanghai, Liu had become the editor for
the modern literature section of *Peace Daily* (《和平日报副刊》) in December
1945. A year later, he quit and founded his own publishing company, Huai
Zheng Culture Publishing Company (怀正文化社). In 1948, when civil war
in China escalated, Liu escaped to Hong Kong. To make ends meet, he
became the *Fukan* editor of several newspapers. Though recognising that “it
is impossible to live on literature in Hong Kong”, Liu always found ways to
“let serious literature live off commercial publications”.23

Liu continued to negotiate the divide between literature and commercial
writing in Singapore. His innovative and beautifully illustrated layouts for
*Bieshu* (别墅), the literary section of *Ih Shih Pao*, showcased his modern
sensibility. For instance, in response to a story that compared slummers to
caged birds, Liu pasted cut-outs of pigeons throughout the page, breaking
the lines between the articles.24 Despite working for the tabloids, Liu was
still celebrated and respected as a serious writer and champion of modern
Chinese literature. Even as NYSP covered the drama of ISP’s shocking
collapse within its pages, it simultaneously ran advertisements promoting
*Bright Snow* (《雪晴》). *Bright Snow* was Liu’s first novel published in
Singapore (by NYSP) and was initially serialised in *Nanfang Evening Post*
(《南方晚报》), NYSP’s evening paper. Two months later, in December
1952, Liu published his second novel, *Dragon Girl* (《龙女》).25

Outside of his work, Liu was a generous mentor to young writers. Former
*Fukan* editor of NYSP and* Lianhe Zaobao*, Xie Ke (pen-name: 谢克; actual
name: Seah Khok Chua 佘克泉), recalled meeting Liu at a literary event
organised by *Sin Lit Pau* in 1952, when Xie was a novice writer studying
at Chung Cheng High School (branch). Xie would later visit Liu at his
residence at Nanyang Khek Community Guild to seek his advice on writing.
Xie would visit at noon during weekends, as Liu would have worked until
the wee hours of the morning clearing newspaper pages. Liu would buy
him *dim sum* at a nearby teahouse, where they would be entertained by
songstresses singing popular tunes. Sometimes, they would take a trishaw
to catch a new film. Xie said, “He would read all my writing and give me considered advice and criticism. He even gave me a list of contemporary
Chinese authors I [had to] read, and I diligently completed my ‘task’ within
half a year”.26 They went on to become lifelong friends, with Liu calling Xie
“one of my oldest friends in Singapore”.27 When Liu moved to a Singapore
Improvement Trust (SIT) flat on the ground floor of Blk 1 Boon Tiong
Road, diagonally across from Xie who lived in Blk 4, other young writers
continued to knock on Liu’s door for literary advice, and he showed them
the same generosity he had shown Xie.28

However, promoting serious literature in Singapore was not easy. The
youths who loved literature were not readers of the tabloids Liu edited. Blue
collar workers and rural farmers formed 30 percent of their readership, with
ladies of the night and women from the performing industries comprising
about 25 percent. “The bar girls, dance hostesses, songstresses and socialites
were interested in the tabloids because they wanted to be featured in them.
Businessmen only formed 10 percent of the readers, and student readers
were less than 5 percent”.29 If Liu had encountered difficulties in Hong Kong
pushing literature to the masses via their local papers, one can imagine the
far greater resistance from his tabloid publishers concerned with appealing
to the lowest common denominator. His unrelenting quest would only lead
to his disillusionment and disappointment.

Unable to see his future in Singapore, Liu returned to Hong Kong in late
1957. Two years later, on 8 June 1959, four days after the People’s Action
Party won the election by a landslide, the Ministry of Home Affairs
banned six obscene tabloids, including *Ti Press*, in an attempt to cultivate
a wholesome society, effectively sounding the death knell for Chinese
tabloids. In a national broadcast, then Home Affairs Minister Ong Pang
Boon said that these obscene tabloids bred an unhealthy view towards life by
portraying a world populated by half-naked licentious women and hooligans
always out to create trouble.30
