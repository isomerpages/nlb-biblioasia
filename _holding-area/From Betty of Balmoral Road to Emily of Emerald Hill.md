#### A study of early drafts of Emily of Emerald Hill reveals fascinating choices and paths not taken.
By Eriko Ogihara-Schuck

Over the last four decades, few Singaporean plays have occupied the imagination as much as Stella Kon’s _Emily of Emerald Hill_. Possibly the most frequently staged play in Singapore, the powerful script and the notable performances of the likes of Margaret Chan, Neo Swee Lin, Karen Tan, Laura Kee, Ivan Heng and others have inspired audiences to think about Peranakan culture and its place in the evolution of Singapore society.

While all this would suggest that the 90-minute monodrama is very well known, there are numerous aspects of Emily that few people are familiar with. Who knows, for example, that Kon had, at one point, planned to title the play Betty of Balmoral Road? 

In an early version of the play, Kon also had a very different motivation in mind for a key moment, a moment that would cause Emily’s world to collapse. However, she decided to rewrite that scene to avoid being too clichéd. Perhaps more importantly, Kon also added another event into the play to allow Emily to redeem herself in the eyes of the audience, a scene that did not exist in an early draft.

And while very much a Singaporean story – Emily Gan is, after all, a Peranakan matriarch living in the Peranakan enclave of Emerald Hill in Singapore – the play also owes much to Singapore’s northern neighbour. Like many Singaporeans, Emily has many links with Malaysia: playwright Stella Kon was living in Ipoh when she began writing the play, and indeed, Emily first debuted in Malaysia.

The first ever performance of the play took place in 1984 in Seremban, Negri Sembilan. That production by the Five Arts Centre was directed by Malaysian teacher, theatre director and playwright Chin San Sooi with Leow Puay Tin as the first Emily.[^1] The play became so beloved across the Causeway that Pearlly Chua, who first began performing as Emily in 1990, has done so hundreds of times over the last three decades.
