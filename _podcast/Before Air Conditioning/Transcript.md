<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>
<br>So, electricity was an essential precursor of air conditioning, and there
was electricity in Singapore from as early as the 1870s. And then you have
the developments in the early, late 19th to the early 20th century of refrigeration
techniques and newer cooling technologies. So, air conditioning really
comes in during the 1920s and the 1930s, first with mechanical ventilation,
which is based on fans and air purification. And then by the 30s, something
that’s more recognisable, is our modern style of air conditioning.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>When was air conditioning actually invented?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>
<br>I think in the early 1920s.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay. So, Singapore wasn’t that far behind then.</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>
<br>No. So, I mean, the idea of cooling the air is ancient. Lots of countries
in Asia have had ways of cooling air for a very long time, but the technology
of air conditioning really developed commercially in the US. And then it
was exported out, and it came directly to Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Music playing]&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>You’re listening to BiblioAsia+, a podcast produced by the National Library
of Singapore. At BiblioAsia, we tell stories about Singapore’s past. Some
familiar, others forgotten, all fascinating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re living in Singapore, you may have noticed that the weather here
tends to be somewhat hot and humid on an average day. The temperature can
go up to a high of about 33°C, while the humidity level hovers around 82
percent. That’s an average day, though. On Singapore's hottest day recorded
so far, which is Saturday, 13 May 2023, the mercury reached a scorching
37 degrees in Ang Mo Kio.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of this is to say that when Lee Kuan Yew described air conditioning
as the greatest invention of the 20th century, well, some days in Singapore,
it’s hard to disagree. We work in air-conditioned offices, we shop in air-conditioned
malls, and many of us live in air-conditioned homes. As ubiquitous as it
is today, though, I still remember a time when it was much less common.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I was surprised to learn that air conditioning is not that new a technology.
It first came to Singapore about 100 years ago. Of course, it took a while
for the technology to catch on. Here to tell us all about the history of
air conditioning in Singapore is Fiona Williamson, who’s a professor in
environmental history at the Singapore Management University.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She’s written an interesting article in <em>BiblioAsia</em> on how air conditioning
was introduced here. It’s based on her recent book, <em><a href="https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/redir/itemdetails?bid=300140803" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Imperial Weather</a></em>,
published by the University of Pittsburgh Press. Welcome to the BiblioAsia+
podcast. Fiona. How’ve you been?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>
<br>Very well, thank you. It’s a pleasure to be here.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>So nice to have you. How long have you been in Asia?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>
<br>Around 15 years.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>So how have you adapted to the weather? You came from the UAE before that?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>
<br>UK.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh, in the UK before that?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>Yeah. So, it was a very big contrast
from the classic English weather with the gray drizzle. Yes. The cooler
temperatures.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>Right.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>I’ve been here long enough to acclimatise.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>Speaking of acclimatising, before air conditioning,
how did people keep cool in Singapore in general?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>Well, long before air conditioning, it
was more a question of architectural solutions. So, we all know, structures
like the incredible Peranakan building, which is just around the corner
from the National Library on Armenian Street.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>Yeah.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>But these buildings were created with
central air wells with sort of things like high ceilings, which encourage
airflow. The windows are placed in a particular way to encourage airflow
to come through the building. And we must also remember that the temperatures
weren’t quite as high in those days. Because of climate change, up until
the 1950s, 1960s, temperatures were a lot lower.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if we’re talking about pre air conditioning days, the temperatures
would have been about 1.5 degrees lower on average and there was less urbanisation,
so you don’t have so much of the urban heat effect. So to keep cool, it
wasn’t quite so much of an issue because it wasn’t so hot anyway. You would
have periods of heatwave but yesterday’s heatwave is more like today’s
normal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, yeah, it wasn’t quite so bad. The only one caveat I would mention,
though, is I’m talking about kind of incredible buildings like the, you
know, the Peranakan Museum. These were homes for the wealthy. Your average
person wouldn’t have lived in these types of places.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But even then, things like shophouses, which were a large part of the
Singapore city centre. They still had high ceilings. They had the verandas,
the five-foot walkways. All of this was designed with the idea of airflow
and ventilation. So, you know, these older-style buildings were perfectly
designed for the tropical weather.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>Right. Okay. But that’s like, you know, buildings
for homes in general. When you start talking about bigger buildings, like
in concert halls or cinemas, it must be different.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>Yes and no. I mean, they were still all
designed with this idea of kind of like, large spaces, ventilation. You
would have had fans in the ceiling, of course, whether they were manual
before the days of electricity. But if you think about things like, you
know, the obviously iconic Raffles Hotel, again, it’s built in this style
where you have blinds, you have these verandas, everything is designed
again for airflow. If you walk through the Raffles Hotel, you can actually
feel a breeze because it’s designed in a way to maximise airflow.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>Okay, tell us about how air conditioning was introduced
to Singapore. When and where and how did it happen?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>Okay. So I think one of the important
things to remember about this is, there have been precursors. You couldn’t
have air conditioning until you had electricity. So electricity was an
essential precursor of air conditioning, and there was electricity in Singapore
from as early as the 1870s. And then you have the developments in the early,
late 19th to the early 20th century of refrigeration techniques and newer
cooling technologies. So air conditioning really comes in during the 1920s
and the 1930s, first with mechanical ventilation, which is based on fans
and air purification. And then by the 30s, something that’s more recognisable,
is our modern style of air conditioning.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>When was air conditioning actually invented?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>I think in the early 1920s.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>Okay. So, Singapore wasn’t that far behind then.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>No. So, I mean, the idea of cooling the
air is ancient. Lots of countries in Asia have had ways of cooling air
for a very long time, but the technology of air conditioning really developed
commercially in the U.S. And then it was exported, and it came directly
to Singapore from the U.S., actually through the Carrier [Air Conditioning]
Company, which was a U.S. company. So, Singapore was a relatively early-adopter.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>Okay. It is impressive. But then how prevalent then
was, you know, air conditioning in the 1920s? What kind of buildings had
it?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>Well, here’s the thing is, it’s very
much based on who had electricity.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>Ah, okay.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>So, in those days, there was a power
station. But the power station was mainly for some of the commercial infrastructure,
like the trams. The main buildings would have been the ones that were large
enough or could afford to have their own generator, like electrical generators.
So, you’re looking at commercial enterprises, basically.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To have an air conditioning unit in your home, it would have been very
expensive. And you would also have had to have had your own personal electrical
generator as well, because most houses, domestic houses were not on the
national grid. There wasn’t a national grid. They would have been commercial
enterprises that could have afforded it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[It was also available where there] would be a real reason to have it.
So, for example, hospitals – the operating surgery in Tan Tock Seng was
one of the first places to have it because operations go better if you’ve
got cooler air rather than heat and humidity. And places where you have
a lot of people gathering, like hotels, concert halls, dance halls – dance
halls in particular were one of the early adopters because it was part
of the USP, the unique selling point, you know, [people] came to our dance
hall because [they had] air conditioning.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>It's obviously more pleasant to dance with air conditioning
than with tropical heat.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>Exactly. And another thing about air
conditioning that we tend to forget about today is that in those days,
everybody smoked.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>Right.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>And if you’re in a dance hall where you’re,
you know, maybe breathing a little more deeply because you’re being physically
active, and it’s full of cigarette smoke, as well as being hot – it’s going
to be pretty unpleasant.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>That does not sound that fun.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>Yeah, so a lot of these early commercial
enterprises were like, okay, come and dance with us, you’ll be cooler,
but you’ll also be healthier. You know, it’ll purify the air. It will get
rid of all the fumes. And it’ll just be this much nicer environment to
dance in.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>Okay. So, do we know the first building in Singapore
to get air conditioning?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>One of the first buildings was the Capitol.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>All right.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>Which actually, you know, very close
to the library. And this, of course, was a major cinema. And owned by wealthy
entrepreneurs who could afford to invest and they actually had the mechanical
ventilation first and then updated again around 1936, I think.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>Right. Well, all this to say that, you know, with
mechanical ventilation systems in the 1920s or 1910s, but, prior to that,
you know, people coming from Europe or wherever coming to Singapore or
to Asia had to encounter the heat and humidity. And so how did they sort
of react? How did they write about it?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>So, there’s a really big kind of historical
literature about adaptation in Europeans in tropical atmospheres. And there
are two sides to this story. On the one hand, there’s this kind of fascination
with the tropics and the incredible colors and the heat and the vibrancy.
But on the other hand, there’s a negative side where a lot of European
doctors felt like the heat and the humidity would be unhealthy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, in particular, it was unhealthy for the European body because it
was unused to, it was not acclimatised. So, there were a lot of medical
studies, talking about the heat and the humidity in the 19th and very early
20th centuries. By the early 20th century, a lot of that thinking was dying
away because it was kind of accepted that it was not as bad as people once
assumed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But at the same time, I mean, it’s going to be hard to adapt, certainly
to start off with, if you’ve just arrived, and you’re not used to living
in such heat. I think one of the things that’s interesting to me is thinking
about transport at that time. These days you get off the plane. I can go
all the way from the UK to Singapore in 12, 13 hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I get on the plane, it’s cold and wet, winter maybe, and I get off and
the heat and humidity just hits me. But in those days, you have to think,
you would have been coming by boat. You would have taken weeks and you’d
have been actually adapting all the way. It wouldn’t have just hit you
like walking out of the door.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You would have adapted as you went through the Middle East. You would
have been on deck as you kind of came past India. And the heat would have
gotten stronger as you came along. So, over several weeks, the body would
have already started to acclimatise. The other thing to think about as
well is that most of the Europeans who came here were not coming here.
They were relatively middle class. They were colonial service. They’re
working for the civil service. And so, they would have had relatively larger
houses. And those larger houses would probably not have been in the city
centre, but maybe slightly outside. In the area now, there is the Tanglin
area on top of Orchard Road. So, these are houses that are usually on slightly
in elevation, or have a lot of land, big gardens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So you would have got more air flow, more ventilation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>Right. Talking about colonial civil servants. Tell
us about meteorology as an imperial science or a colonial project. How
does one understand meteorology within that particular framework?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>So, meteorology has been really important
to the colonial enterprise, right from the very beginnings of European
expansion or exploration. Firstly, because of oceangoing or seagoing navigation,
you need to understand the weather. Especially, you know, in the days before
steamships, you were completely reliant on the winds, on the weather. But
when talking about the British colonial context, when they first came here,
they went to Penang in the 1780s.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And one of the very first things they did was take the temperature and
the rainfall. And they did this for about six months after they first arrived,
because it was super important for them to understand whether, you know,
the area around Penang Island would be suitable for habitation. The weather,
of course, is important for that, but more importantly, suitable for long
term habitation in the sense of growing fruit, vegetables, crops, ultimately
ones that could be commercial.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, they did lots of studies of the natural environment, the soils, the
local plants, flora, fauna as well as the weather. And you see these arguments
in the very early days of settlement establishing the Straits Settlements,
that arguments were being used like, well, you know, this place has a deep
harbour, but then this place also has a great climate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be fantastic for growing commercial crops at a later date. So,
the weather was really important right from the beginning as part of this
commercialisation of the new areas where the British were going.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>Right. And I think in Singapore, when the British
first arrived, rainfall and temperature were one of the first things that
they began recording. Records actually go quite far back, don’t they?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>They do. There are records here literally
from 1819. There are gaps, huge gaps, but so there are records. Actually,
I think there’s some early ones even going back to about 1815 from Singapore.
With early commercial, just exploration. And then from 1819 onwards, right
through, well, until the present day, there are gaps around the 30s, 40s
and 50s, because meteorology wasn’t being kept by anyone in particular.
It was a bit of an ad hoc affair. But from the 1860s onwards, it became
more of a kind of a government-owned enterprise. And from then on, we’ve
got more accurate continuous records.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>In Malaya, I mean we have these observational stations
that are used to gather meteorological data. You know, why do we need a
station and how do they, can’t you just put it in a cup with a machine
with a ruler or something to measure rainfall.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>Well, early rain gauges are pretty much
like that. I mean, they tend to be like a standard size. But yeah, they
are pretty much just, you know, a very large kind of cup. With a measuring
apparatus. So rainfall is actually one of the easiest things to measure.
And rainfall has been measured in countries in Asia since the 1500s in
places like Korea, China. So, this is very early technology that was well
known around the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Temperature was harder because you had to wait for the invention of the
thermometer. So, the Fahrenheit thermometer was brought in from the UK.
It was made by instrument manufacturers in London. And then brought in
by the East India Company ships, via India and then down to Malaya.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then that was what was being used in Georgetown, in Singapore and
in Malacca for very, very early observations. So, the Straits Settlements,
the urban centres have got those observational sites. Originally, they
were more likely to be military sites. So, observations would be kept at
Fort Canning because it was a military site where you had officers who
were used to making measurements because they would have done it on board
ship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And later you have more ad hoc stations. So, plantation owners, for example,
were really interested in rainfall because they were growing crops. So,
they might make their own observations. So those were some of the reasons
for the kind of observational sites that were either plantations or civic
sites. So libraries often were places where –&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>Oh, really?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>Yeah, libraries would, they would keep
observations. And I think mainly it’s because these were government owned.
You know, so it’s like a government exercise. And these are government-owned
sites. Botanic Gardens, obviously, I suppose. But then hospitals, from
the 1880s, hospitals were the main observation points for the whole Malay
Peninsula. And Tan Tock Seng actually had its own observatory.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>Oh. When you say an observatory, what did it have?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>Instruments like the barometer, rain
gauge, thermometer.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>All right. Did the colonial government attempt to
manage the weather and make Singapore or Malaya more livable?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>Yeah. I mean, I think they would have
loved to have done more, to reduce the humidity. But, you know, the technology
simply wasn’t there. But, what they did try to do was to manage the weather
through infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the town started to grow, it was obvious from the beginning that there
was an issue particularly with water, not just the lack of water for people
to drink as the population grew. But water was also required for the port
because ships would come into the ports, to take on fresh water. So, as
the population grew and as the commercial enterprises grew, there was a
need for more fresh water. And actually the commercial reasons were probably
even more so than the population increases. But then conversely, you have
the opposite effect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You know, this is a monsoon climate. Every December, January, there were
heavy rains and we don’t really notice it in modern day Singapore. Yeah,
we can get annoyed because, you know, it’s been raining for the entire
week. It’s, you know, difficult to manage. But in those days, if it rained
for an entire week, whole parts of Singapore would have flooded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And not just like a little bit of inconvenience, but, like, seriously
flooded for days. And this then had a knock-on effect in terms of disease
as well. So, it was really in the government’s interests to both provide
better sources of water through reservoirs, but also to control water that
fell so that it wouldn’t flood.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, lots of big engineering projects were taking place in the late 19th
and early 20th centuries.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>Clearly with Singapore becoming increasingly urbanised,
cutting down forests. You have the urban heat problem. Can you talk about
how the environment in Singapore began to change during this period?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>It changed quite quickly. And I think
it’s interesting actually, looking at colonial sites like Singapore because
say, in England, towns developed much more slowly over long, long, long
periods. Here, because of the kind of rapid migration and the rapid development,
you get this kind of lesson in environmental change in microcosm, you know,
some things that will happen over like 100 years rather than 500.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, you can almost see change happening. If you were here in the 19th
century for one generation, in your lifetime you’d have seen so much change
happen. And from very early on, land was cleared for plantation, commercial
use. But the city grew as well, very, very quickly. Not through birthrate,
but through immigration. And the sheer numbers of people coming in to seek
new opportunities from all over Asia, and then settling here, staying for
the long term. So, urbanisation happened very, very fast. The majority
of the changes actually happened probably post-1950s. It’s actually been
because of, again, you know, urbanisation happened mainly since the 1950s,
but a lot of that original kind of forests and stuff that was developed
into plantations was already gone in the 19th century.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And after the plantations, a lot of them shut down. A lot of the newer
housing estates that we have are actually built on old plantation sites
because they had already been cleared.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>You know, that obviously has implications, right.
Because obviously, if you have a city and you have roads, you don’t have
earth and grass and trees to absorb the water.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>Or the heat.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>Or heat, yes. So, that increases flooding. Of course,
you have a greater population, so more people are affected. And then, you
know, it’s much hotter.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>Yeah. It is a vicious cycle. It is very
difficult for governments, especially in those days with limited resources
to do really too much about it. And I think one of the things that I found
interesting is that you always think of the British Empire as being incredibly
wealthy. And certain people in certain parts of it were, but really, when
it came to a lot of the colonies in Southeast Asia, the government in London
kind of said, okay, you can just do your own thing. You look after yourself.
And so, when it came to creating a big reservoir project or something,
the local people here had to rely on a lot of donations. Major philanthropists,
to actually give the money to sponsor some of these projects. So, you can
see<s> </s>engineering projects that were proposed, but they just never
got enacted.</p>
<p>So, the government had the right idea, but they just simply couldn't do
a lot of things because they didn't have the money or the resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>I was reading your book where you talk about MacRitchie
reservoir, but there was a mistake? Can you tell us a little bit about
that?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>Actually Brenda Yeoh from NUS has written
quite a lot about this as well. But that, the MacRitchie project. Yeah,
it was funded in the 1840s, maybe 1850s. And it took about 20 or 30 years
to come to fruition. The original money was given by a wealthy Chinese
philanthropist. And he bequeathed the money saying that Singapore needs
this reservoir. We need the water. And he gave the money. But the problem
was the amount of time it took. Of course, you have inflation. So, the
original costs and the money that he gave wasn’t enough to complete the
project because of inflation. And then, of course, over that period of
time, the urban centre and the commercial centre had developed so much
more was actually needed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, it was like it never quite kept up with need. And there was a major
drought in 1877, and the newspapers were just full of complaints like,
we’ve got this reservoir sitting there and it’s not working yet. And it
finally partially came online at the end of 1877. And then the government
kind of propaganda machine pushes out all this: Oh, isn’t it wonderful?
You know, the drought has been resolved because of MacRitchie and actually,
you know, the drought was just over anyway. But yeah, so it took ages and
funding was a huge, huge problem. And also because reservoirs in those
days (and still are in many respects) were built on what we call the gravitation
principle.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>What does that mean?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>So, you build it on a hill so you don’t
need to rely so much on pumps to pump the water from the reservoir, to
have enough pressure to actually push it into people’s taps. Or wherever
it is you want it to go. You need the pressure. So, gravity provides the
pressure. Of course, you know, that area around MacRitchie is elevated,
but Singapore doesn’t have mountains. So, it was never quite high enough
to provide enough pressure without using additional pumps. They didn’t
have enough pumps and the gravity wasn’t quite enough. So, there were some
flaws in the original design.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>Okay, okay. That’s a shame. It’s a very pretty reservoir.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>Well, it works well now.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>You’re comparing present day Singapore to the early
20th century. How different or similar are discussions about climate issues?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>There are similarities. They understood
that the climate changed in the early 20th century. And they were also
particularly concerned about human impacts, anthropogenic impacts on the
climate. They already understood, from the 19th century, that humans could
impact the climate. And things like chopping down trees would change, could
increase heat, could potentially decrease rainfall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, these questions were already understood. And there are questions even
in the local council minutes. Governmental minutes from meetings were,
you know, so and so from representing a particular area of Singapore would
say, you know, Mr. Speaker, you know, what can we say about chopping down
trees? Are we going to address this problem?&nbsp;</p>
<p>So they’re actually kind of asking: given that we know that climate change
is induced by people, what are we doing to address this? So, they were
asking these questions over 100 years ago. Which is not that dissimilar
today. I think the difference is that the science was not as strong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was more like inferred. So, people knew that cities tended to be hotter
than rural areas because you could feel it. It was experiential. People
knew that temperature had increased slightly in areas where there had been
deforestation because they’d seen it on the meteorological records, but
science was still not as strong. And also it just wasn’t considered to
have been a big deal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They were worried that if the climate changed, rainfall would change.
That might have an impact on agriculture. They were not concerned that
there would be the impact like we know today about the rising temperatures
and how it would affect human health, human survivability and adaptability.
They just didn’t think it was ever going to be that big a deal. They were
just concerned about whether we would have enough rain to water the rubber
plantations. So, the scale wasn’t there, so the urgency wasn’t there.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>Okay. I’d like to turn to your book, <em><a href="https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/redir/itemdetails?bid=300140803" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Imperial Weather</a></em>.
Tell us what the book is about.</p>
<p>Only it’s a big question, is it not? It’s like 260 pages or so.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>So, I guess it’s about all aspects of
thinking about weather in the Straits Settlements, especially Singapore,
largely from a British colonial perspective. So, it starts off with thinking
about what was weather science, how it was understood, how the climate
was understood and how climate change was understood. It then moves into
thinking about controlling the weather.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I look at things like how the government controlled floods or droughts
or tried to control heat and humidity through the introduction of cooling
systems like air conditioning. So, it’s kind of about all these different
ways of thinking through weather. It talks about weather and health and
how that was conceptualised by the colonial government. It talks about
managing the weather, but also a little bit about how weather kind of created
the rhythms of life in the Straits Settlements as they were then.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>It’s a wonderful book and everybody should read it and buy it. What kind
of sources did you have to refer to or to plumb –&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>
<br>– in order to write? Well, I mean, this is one of the reasons why the
book took so long to write, because –&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>How long did it take to write?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>
<br>Probably about 2 to 3 years. And it’s because you can’t just go to an
archive or a library and do a search for weather because the weather is
so ubiquitous. It’s not catalogued. You can’t go to the National Archives
of Singapore and just put in “weather” because weather accounts or meteorological
records might be in something else and is not going to be catalogued in
that way. So, you have to look for sources. I read a lot of things like
agricultural records, plantation records, colonial government records.
And you just have to go through a lot of material to find. You had to …&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>… sift through all these…&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>
<br>…many, many different records, everything, manually. And of course, Singapore
was a British colony. So, a lot of the records are not in Singapore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>
</p>
<p>So, it would have been very convenient for me working at SMU to have just
gone round the corner to the National Archives. But a lot of the records
are actually in Cambridge. From the British, Malayan Association. A lot
of them were in London, in the National Archives in Cuba. And they’re in
different places as well, even like the Royal Society for more things like,
the scientific records. I went to the Wellcome Trust in London, which is
a medical archive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>
</p>
<p>How did it help? So that’s the experiments that they were making – medical
experiments that they were [doing on] the effects of heat on the human
body.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>
</p>
<p>So, there’s all sorts of things. That’s one of the reasons why it took
so long, because there was just so much. And pretty much any record, so
personal diaries. At some point, you’re going to come across some reference
to the weather because there’s going to have been some bad weather, a storm,
a flood or something like that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>So, you go into personal diaries looking for people and they say, “oh,
it rained really badly today”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>
</p>
<p>Yeah. Also the newspapers. So, what I would tend to do as a starting point
is I would maybe go through all the newspapers. I went through about 100
years worth of newspapers looking for floods and droughts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Is this in Singapore? I mean, in Malaya?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>
</p>
<p>Yes, so these are the National Library’s…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Oh, NewspaperSG.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>
</p>
<p>Yeah, brilliant resource.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>It is wonderful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>
</p>
<p>And so I went through about 100 years of that looking for floods and droughts
because those are things that stand out. And so once I had those particular
years, I could then maybe go to somebody’s diary and look up that particular
year and see if they mentioned it. So, then I can then get context. So,
if there was a major flood in 1926, for example. If I’ve got a diary from
1926, I can then go through the diary and say, okay, did they experience
it? I can then go and look at district office records. So, the National
Archives of Malaysia, for example, has some really good district records.
So, I can then go to, like, district officer records, people who are actually
employed to work in the regions, some of the rural areas, and see what
they say about it. And they would often say they have records of flood
heights or impact on local people in this area. You know, the floodwaters
reached six feet deep and there were five casualties or, you know, information
like that. So, you build this picture from lots of different sources. It’s
like putting together a jigsaw. So official records, personal records.
And they all come together to provide context.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>What was the genesis of this book?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>
</p>
<p>Actually, more than 15 years ago, I was asked to look up, for a project
I was working on back in the UK, meteorological records for Malaya. And
as I started to look up the actual meteorological data, it was a scientific
project. And from that project, I started getting interested in the weather
here. By that time, I was living out here as well. And the meteorological
data in itself is useful for scientists. But as a historian, it's not such
fun, interesting information. It’s just pure data. It’s great for scientists
because they can put it into models to see how climate changes are taking
place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But for me, I wanted to start to find out a little bit more about, well,
how are they making these records? Why is there a gap for this year? So,
I started finding out a little bit more context. You have to find out more
about the history to find out whether it’s why there’s suddenly a 10 year
gap in a record. So I just started looking more and more, and it just kind
of evolved over time to suddenly become this much larger project. I had
lots, lots more material.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>[The book] could be even thicker than this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>
</p>
<p>Yeah, it could actually be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>You’re a full-time professor at SMU but you’re also the co-president of
– and this is something I’ve never heard of – the International Commission
for the History of Meteorology. What is it, and what does it involve? You
get to go up on weather balloons and things?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>
</p>
<p>I wish. No, it was established about 20 or so years ago by a very eminent
historian of meteorology in the U.S., Jim Fleming. And he and some of his
colleagues were all doing history of meteorology subjects and really felt
like there needed to be like a group that brought people together. And
he was very successful in rallying people and making this kind of what’s
been, I suppose, a largely informal group of people with an interest in
the history of meteorology. There's now several hundred members across
the entire world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>You meet every year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>
</p>
<p>No, we don’t have funds necessarily to meet up and have an annual conference.
But we do have events, we sponsor panels at conferences. I’ve just come
back from the UK, actually. We had a nice, sponsored panel in Cambridge.
So, yeah, we do all sorts of events around the place just promoting the
history of meteorology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>It sounds fascinating. You teach all this at SMU. If a student came up
to you and said, “why should I sign up for your course”? What would you
say to them?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>
</p>
<p>Well, I would say that if you want to find out a different side of Singapore
history to the one that you perhaps learned at school, and if you want
to understand more about how Singapore has grown in terms of its environmental
history, or climatic history, then you come to my class. Because I think
that seeing the growth of a city or the development of a city is very different
from thinking about, say, a political narrative of a city, for example.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the weather intersects with everything, it intersects with environmental
issues, and it intersects with political issues. Intersects with the economy.
So, it’s actually a way of seeing history through this very kind of holistic
lens, but through the lens itself being the weather or the environment.
It’s just a different way of looking at things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Okay. We do this with all our guests. We get them to complete a sentence.
If I say to you “climate history” what would you say? Climate history is…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>
</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Why is it awesome?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>
</p>
<p>Because it teaches you about everything. You know, the climate is so ubiquitous
to our existence as humans. It dictates what we eat, how we behave, the
times of day in which we do things. And even today, you know, kind of very
air conditioned, a world where we feel like we’re very distinct from climate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And this is something that I say to my students, we still don’t realise
how dependent we are on the climate. For example, if there’s a major drought
in Russia or the U.S., suddenly, grain prices go up. If there’s kind of
problems in Southeast Asia due to major floods, suddenly it’s harder to
get rice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that actually affects the prices of food on your table. It really
does still affect us in every way and understanding about the long history
of it and how, for example, we’ve known about climate change. It’s been
happening for such a long time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>I think we can all agree that it is very important. You know, there’s
a great understanding these days about the impact of climate change. Do
you think we’re likely to make a difference and stop climate change?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>
</p>
<p>I think we need to move quicker. I think that one of the things as a historian
that depresses me slightly is we have known about it since the 19th century.
That’s unsurprising. And although maybe the scale of the understanding
of the impact wasn’t necessarily understood. What I also know from kind
of looking at much later history, like the 70s and the 80s, politicians
have known about it in the 70s and 80s and it actually really requires
a lot of political will to have done more in the past. And I think we really
should have started in the ’70s, in the ’80s, to have done more. So, we’re
now playing a game of catch up. The Singapore government, of course, is
really addressing climate change, providing a lot of funding for research,
which I see through the university side.</p>
<p>But Singapore is a small country in terms of the world. It’s really the
bigger countries like the US –</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>China.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Williamson</strong>
</p>
<p>China, yeah. That needs to step up because they’re the ones that have
the biggest impact but it’s a group effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
