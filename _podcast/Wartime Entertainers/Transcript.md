<p>[Music playing]</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>During the war in Vietnam in the 1960s, big-name entertainers went to
South Vietnam to perform for American troops. In addition to stars though,
a bunch of musicians from Singapore were also roped in. Why did local musicians
choose to perform in South Vietnam in a war zone, and what was the experience
like? I’m Jimmy Yap, and with me to talk about these musicians during the
Vietnam War, is Boon Lai.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He's a co-author and illustrator of the graphic novel trilogy, <em><a href="https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/redir/itemdetails?bid=204463645" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">The Once &amp; Marvelous DKD</a></em>,
which is based on these local bands. In addition, he’s also written about
<a href="https://biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg/vol-20/issue-1/apr-jun-2024/singapore-bands-vietnam-war/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">these bands in</a><em><a href="https://biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg/vol-20/issue-1/apr-jun-2024/singapore-bands-vietnam-war/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">BiblioAsia</a></em>.
Welcome to BiblioAsia+ Boon Lai. How are you?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong> 
<br>I’m good. Thanks for having me.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>You’ve written about these guys in <em>BiblioAsia</em>. How did you come
to know about them?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong> 
<br>Well, the interesting thing was around 2016, I was producing a short documentary
for a Singapore Heritage film fest, and I chose to make a documentary based
on Singapore sixties music.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Okay. Did you know very much about Singapore sixties music at the time?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong> 
<br>Well, I mean, just as much as, you know, as anyone who had a passing interest.
So, what I did was I got in touch with <a href="https://catalogue.nlb.gov.sg/search/card?id=4c517319-80bb-11ee-9d6b-6d86ef49420c&amp;entityType=Agent" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Joseph Pereira</a>,
who actually wrote three books on the subject.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Yeah, he’s practically a local expert.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong> 
<br>Yeah, he’s a local expert in this. And I introduced myself and I said,
“I’m interested to just interview you and just have you talk about the
sixties music scene.” So, what happened was we spent three or four days
at his place at that point of time and afternoons over lunch and tea. We
had discussions about, you know, the sixties music scene, how it began
right up to how it ended. So that was a good session. He mentioned that
“Oh you know, as the music scene died out in the sixties, many of the musicians
had to find new ways of making a living.” And he mentioned that some of
the bands actually even had to go up to South Vietnam to perform. So as
soon as I heard that, as a storyteller, it was kind of like a…</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Light bulb moment?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong> 
<br>Light bulb moment. I was struck with this mental image of our Singapore
bands, young kids flying in on <em>Huey </em>helicopters, choppers over
treetops and then music, Rolling Stones music, blasting as they were, you
know, passing by paddy fields and all sorts. That stuck with me. And I
went home and I told my wife, I said, “You know what? This is a story that
I need to make. You know, it’s going to be either a film or a documentary
of some form.” But the fact is that, you know, film and documentary will
require a little bit of funding and a lot more process. So, I thought,
okay, the immediate way of getting the story together would be to do a
graphic novel, because for me, I see the graphic novel as a form of a visualised
screenplay anyway.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Right, right, right.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong> 
<br>Yeah. Yeah. So, what happened was right after that, I started my three
years of research.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Wow. Did Joseph give you the names of the people who went to Vietnam?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong>
<br>He mentioned quite a number. Veronica Young, definitely. And then Impian
Bateks and then Steve Bala and the Esquires and others like Robert Suriya
and Cedric and even Shirley Naya.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Wow, some big names, eh?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong>
<br>Yeah, big names in the Singapore scene, actually, at that point of time.
Yeah. So, I got the names, I went into Facebook and start looking…</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Stalking all these guys.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong>
<br>Stalking, sending them messages. And eventually the ones who responded
were the three of them. Right. I think the rest did not get the message
or you know, they probably thought I was a stalker. Yeah. So that’s how
I got in touch with Veronica, Harris and Steve Bala.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>When did these musicians go to Vietnam? In the late sixties, was it?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong>
<br>So, the ones that we’re talking about like Veronica, Steve, they went
up late 1960s. Now late 1960s in Vietnam at that point of time. You can
imagine the fighting at that point of time was pretty fierce. So it was
getting quite intense. And by some accounts, the Americans even had up
to 500,000 troops.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>It’s not a small number.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong>
<br>From my research, what I found was that there were many little bases formed
along the coast, right from Saigon, all the way up to the DMZ [demilitarized
zone]. Each base was technically a little city on its own. Built with American
money, American technology, and all of that. So, that was kind of situation
that we had – intense fighting, the Vietcong were gaining ground. They
were pushing from the west towards the coast. Kind of like sandwiching
American allies. And the “best” part was, well, they were conducting guerilla
warfare, so there was no way you could tell [who they were] – they would
come in plain clothes. They looked like everyone else you could identify.
This is enemy. This is friend. So it was kind of an edgy situation.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>American troops were fighting and, of course, you know, dying. But entertainers
were actually sent to these camps to entertain the troops. Right. So, I’m
guessing, you know, did they get rotated and have a bit of R&amp;R in-country?
Is that what happened?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong>
<br>Well, I think the US military thought that “Okay, well, it’s a very stressful
situation”, right? I mean, you have soldiers who have been drafted at a
very young age, right? Coming in from, you know, some rural parts of America,
haven’t even seen the world, prior to that, arriving in Vietnam. And suddenly
it’s a total shock. Right. And I think the level of stress must have been
pretty intense that they thought, “Okay, you know, one way to relieve that
stress or to give them a sense of connection back home is through entertainment.”
Back then, you know, it was still the early days of television. You didn’t
have iPhones. The only thing you had was basically radio and records. So,
music had been a very big part of their lives.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Hence, like, Good Morning Vietnam.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong>
<br>Exactly. So, a lot of audio back then, you know, not as much visual yet.
They had their entertainment on a regular basis, almost nightly basis,
whenever they could get it.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Right.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong>
<br>What you had were our performers who were assigned to travel up from,
you know, from Saigon. And then they’d hit each individual base as they
went up. And they would be performing for the soldiers.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>So you mentioned in your <em>BiblioAsia</em> article that there were a number
of local musicians that went up to Vietnam specifically, Veronica Young,
Impian Bateks and Steve Bala Siren, right? And you know, these were young
musicians who decided to go up and do gigs in South Vietnam. It was in
the middle of a war zone. Why did these people decide to do something that
sounds, on hindsight, pretty dangerous?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong>
<br>Well, I think we have to remember they were really young, in their early
twenties. So, if you think about the Singapore sixties music scene, people
like Veronica Young and Impian Bateks, that was during the golden age of
Singapore music that started around the sixties and then peaked around
[mid-] 1960s and they had recording deals.</p>
<p></p>
<p>They had, you know, pretty well-paying gigs, great performances in Singapore
and even further afield. Now what happened was that pretty much died down
towards the towards the end of 1960s. And just imagine, these guys were
not qualified at that point of time. Singapore was in its early days of
building itself up, right? We were not that economically strong at that
point of time and they had to find means of earning a living, right? So
as soon as they got offers, from recruitment agents – and we are talking
about not small amounts of money. They were going to be paid in US dollars
and in quantums of what, at least three to four times of what they were
earning in Singapore.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Wow. Okay. That’s a significant incentive.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong>
<br>Money was a very big motivation, right? They had to consider their own
futures, their families, they had to support family as well. But I think
there was also a tinge of, “hey, this is something new”, right? This is
something new. This sounds exciting. You know, it’s like a promise of adventure.
And being young and in the sixties, on top of that I think the prospect
of, you know, sex, drugs, rock ‘n’ roll, and going into the jungle and
doing all of that was just a little bit hard to pass up. But then again,
having said that, not every band accepted the offers. There were those
who basically turned the offers down, because, you know, they thought it
was too dangerous, or the family or the parents did not allow them to go.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>These trips to South Vietnam – they were arranged by, you said, recruitment
agents?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong>
<br>Yeah, they were arranged by recruitment agents, so, okay, I’ll go into
the technicality a little bit because I think it’s worth understanding
the bigger picture. We know now that show business and the business of
entertaining US troops was a very, very big business, right?</p>
<p></p>
<p>There was definitely a lot of money pumped into the region from the US
at that point in time to prop up the war efforts in South Vietnam. And
one of the ways entertainers were brought in was the official way: they
would go through the USO, the United Services Organization, which kind
of supports the US military needs, right?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Entertainment needs.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong>
<br>Entertainment, and everything else, whatever, any kind of, noncombat related.
USO would bring in big names back then, like Bob Hope, Nancy Sinatra, for
instance, James Brown. And of course, being big names, they were pretty
safe. I mean, they knew their way of going about [would be] well organized,
well planned. I mean, you can’t have a disaster, right? Yeah. So that would
be that one way.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The second way would be independent bands on their own accord, who would
go up as volunteers.There were no offers or whatever. They would just go
on their own accord, and they would occasionally strike deals with the
military and say, “Okay, we’ll perform for you guys. You know, if you can
cover our, maybe, accommodation and or even our transportation needs and
all of that.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now, the third way would be, apparently, each US base was given free rein
to arrange their own entertainment. Right, now, this is where it gets interesting
because, they were given certain budgets, free rein for them to decide
who to engage. It actually created a lot of – it actually created a network
that was pretty corrupt in that sense.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And then you had people who heard about this, who heard that, “hey, there’s
money to be earned”, right? You had agents popping up and saying, “Okay,
good, fine, you guys need entertainers? I’ll go find.” So, there were agents
going all over the region, right? Korea, Thailand, we mentioned Singapore,
Malaysia, the Philippines and all of that. And so, when we talk about Singapore,
the agents would come over here, and they would visit the clubs, our local
scene. And as soon as they saw certain bands, they would approach the band
or the entertainers and say, “Okay, would you want to come up to South
Vietnam? I think you’re a good match. You know, the G.I.s are going to
love you because of the kind of songs that you were performing.”</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>So, selling them a bit.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong>
<br>Selling them that, you know, selling that sizzle. And then if they sensed
that, okay if they were a little bit worried about certain things, “Okay,
fine, we’ll throw a $500,000 insurance in case you are killed or you get,
you know, maimed or anything like that.” So, they had ways to try to recruit…</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Musicians.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong>
<br>Musicians. So as soon as the musicians decided to join in, they would
get themselves packed up, flown from Paya Lebar airport&nbsp;all the way
up to Tân Sơn Nhất, in Saigon back then. As soon as they landed, they would
get quickly bundled up, cleared through immigration and checkpoints, and
they would be sent to halfway houses in areas like Cholon district, you
know, seedy areas and all of that. And, within a few days, these guys would
have to, you know, get their instruments ready.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And that was another thing that happened, which I thought was rather interesting
as well. For instance, Steve and Esquires, they even had to audition before
a committee of staff sergeants. The staff sergeants were determining their
rate, how much they could actually command for each performance.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>What was the rate like?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong>
<br>The really good ones – just so happen to be Filipinos – were getting something,
if I’m not mistaken, like US$800–US$1,000 per show.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Wow. Significant amount of money.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong>
<br>Significant. Very significant. Then they’d just wait for the day when
they [would] get called up and sent out. Yeah.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>So, the Filipinos were getting like 800 bucks a show. How much were the
Singaporeans getting?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong>
<br>Singaporeans... let me, let me try to recall the number.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Not as much as $800.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong>
<br>Not as much. They were getting like $400, maybe eight. Okay, sometimes.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>But still, you know, you multiply that by the total number of shows that
you do. Yeah, you know, it’s a significant amount of money. Just give us
a bit of an idea, you know, what kind of situations these musicians faced.
I mean, they weren’t out in the field playing music, while a battle was
raging, for example, right? It’s not what happened.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong>
<br>I recall once where Veronica told me about a nightly curfew, right? So
definitely because Saigon at that point of time was being besieged, technically,
they had a nightly curfew. So there an occasion when, you know, she needed
help for one of the band members who was sick and all of that.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And [Veronica] had the guts to actually go out, break curfew, go out and
try to look for, for a doctor. So, she’s a very gutsy lady. She was stopped,
had flashlights and rifles pointed at her and [was asked], you know, “What
are you doing?” Someone was shouting at her in Vietnamese, and she couldn’t
speak. So that could have gone wrong in so many ways, in an environment
as safe as Saigon. Yeah. Things could have exploded at any point of time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Right. I mean explode literally because there were many cases of bands
performing in pubs and clubs and on stage. And suddenly somebody would
hurl a grenade at the band – and that’s it.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh wow.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong>
<br>You know, many, many there were many reports of that happening.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>They really didn’t like the music or...? This was the Vietcong attack.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong>
<br>It’s basically anything can happen at any point of time, right, even before
they left Saigon. As soon as they left Saigon, things got even more…</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Hairy.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong>
<br>The bands had no clue what their weekly or even their daily schedules
were going to be like. They did have a manager assigned to them, and the
manager would go just ahead of them, you know, to different bases, try
to book them, get them to play as many gigs as possible, whatever was available.</p>
<p></p>
<p>All they could remember was they had covered, what they described as,
hundreds of places. [What] their daily routine was, they couldn’t say because
it was so unpredictable. They would be transported to a base. It could
be an outpost even.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Not necessarily a “base” base, but it could just be an outpost.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong>
<br>It could be an outpost. Like, for instance, I think, Steve and Esquires,
they basically got into some pretty rural areas as well. This is very interesting.
Steve mentioned that they were flown into somewhere in the jungle on a
helicopter, and the chopper would land at what they called the landing
zone, the LZs, right?</p>
<p></p>
<p>And it was just in the middle of the jungle. They couldn’t see anything
else. And they were told, “Okay, set up”, and they were like, “Okay, what’s
going on?” So, they just set things up, you know, with their equipment
and with the speakers and all of that. And it was just “Who we’re going
to be playing to? Monkeys or what?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>But as soon as they started tuning their equipment and all of that, within
10 feet, 15 minutes, soldiers [started coming] out from the jungle.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>They came out in their camos. And helmets and weapons?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong>
<br>Yeah yeah, all covered and all that. They would just come out and for
that period of time they would just go crazy. They would just let loose
– a lot of, a lot of beer, a lot of drugs, apparently joints, and the band.
The band also travelled with strippers, right? Just to spice things up.
They had strippers as well.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>And, this was dangerous, right? I mean, going to all these outposts was
not safe.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong>
<br>Definitely not safe. So, all of them mention at one point of time, getting
shot at.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Yeah, distinctly unsafe.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong>
<br>And yeah, you know, the Esquires were performing on stage and suddenly
they heard a <em>zing</em>, like something just zipping past them. And then
when they looked behind at the backdrop, there was a bullet hole. Somebody
had actually just taken a pot shot at them.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh man. That’s scary.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong>
<br>Yeah. And then even when they’re on the road travelling to their destinations,
occasionally the driver would shout, “Okay, guys, hit the deck!” And that’s
it. They had to just sprawl [on the floor] and that’s it. And then bullets
would tear through the canvases and stuff like that. It was not safe.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Veronica, as a woman, you know, clearly must have had a slightly different
experience, from Haris Hamzah and Steve Bala. You know, can you give us
an idea of what that was like?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong>
<br>In a war situation in that kind of environment, it was pretty dangerous,
uncomfortable... Now add to the fact that you have a lot of, stressed-up,
young men far away from home, where social order was breaking down and
as soon as they see women – it could be singers or even strippers and all
of that – all the basic instincts are stirred up right?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Unwanted male attention.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong>
<br>They got a lot of attention. I mean, they got a lot of attention from
the soldiers, of course. Veronica mentioned that the soldiers would find
every opportunity to look at you, to touch you. There were also cases where,
well, where female entertainers were being friendly with the soldiers,
and that led to pretty violent episodes, right? Where it went in a direction
that the entertainers had not expected. Right? So, there were cases of,
you know, where the soldiers would try to, you know, pressure the women
for sex or sexual favours. They would also try to get their way with the
women.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>But there’s a great story about Veronica defending herself.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong>
<br>As Veronica mentioned, one night when she was in one of the bases, she
was at one end of the barracks, cooking noodles and stuff like that for
dinner, for the band and herself. And as she was preparing, cutting up
the chili, knife in hand and all of that, suddenly there was a figure that
came up to her and grabbed her from behind, very large and big, grabbed
her from behind.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now, being the gutsy lady that she is, she thrust the knife back, stabbed
the guy, and he basically bled. You know you got to have a certain kind
of <em>gungho</em> characteristic to survive that environment. You’re right.
I mean, male or female, you can’t just go in, pampered and all of that
and expect to survive.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>It was a pretty rough environment.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong> 
<br>It was a very rough environment. The entertainers who made it, made it
through, had a steely quality about them.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Yeah, that wouldn’t be me. How long did Impian Bateks play in Saigon,
a year?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong> 
<br>Typically it would have been three to four months. Three to four months,
kind of to try things out to see if they could survive it.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Literally.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong> 
<br>Literally. And within three to four months, just imagine one day they
can do minimum two shows, maybe three.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Yeah, that many.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong> 
<br>Yes. So, we see the math is starting to work out. Two shows a day over
three to four months. It’s not a holiday. Within three to four months they
would have done hundreds of performance shows. it sounds impossible, but
actually they did it, right? They would have done the hundreds. So, they
say after that, three to four months were up, and then they have a choice.
There were bands who actually stayed on and renewed their contracts. So,
despite the situation, the dangers, and all that we mentioned, they came
back.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Money was too good.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong> 
<br>Money was too good. Or it could be addiction. I don’t know. I spoke to
Joseph about this, and he said it could be the addiction.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>The adrenaline?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong> 
<br>The adrenaline – because that became normal, having spent three months,
four months, some up to even a year; some went again and again and again
and again, right? Because they felt that, “Hey, if I made it through the
first time, I could still do it if I apply the same wit.” Veronica did
at least two tours. She went back.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>With the Impian Bateks?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong> 
<br>No, the second time she was with another group.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>And Esquires?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong> 
<br>They completed the tour, and that was it. Because their experience was
pretty intense. They had incidents or situations where they were right
in the midst of shelling, bombing and night raid bombing in Danang. They
really felt that things were getting really, really precarious for them.
So maybe they thought, okay, might be a good idea to heed the signs and
just call it quits. There were cases of, many cases of, entertainers getting
killed. Yeah, it was not uncommon.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>This is all very interesting. You know, so you’re saying that it took
you three years to put together <em>The Once Marvelous DKD</em>? What was
your research process like?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong> 
<br>I spoke to the guys. I decided that I wanted to get as close as possible
to the experience that these guys had gone through. I started with the
library. And there was this book called the <em><a href="https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/redir/itemdetails?bid=706952" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Vietnam Sketchbook</a></em> published
in 1968, a short series of sketches by a G.I. I thought that was a good
starting point because, to have the sketches done by a G.I. of a place,
it gave me an understanding of that place.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I did read quite a number of graphic novels as well, by survivors of the
Vietnam War. I also read quite a number by [American comic book artist]
Will Eisner.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>What did the research into all these people, how did that, you know, influence
your graphic novel?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong> 
<br>I saw in them the spirit that I suspected was there. For someone to do
this, they must have a certain way about them. They actually embodied the
spirit of, well, we call it foolhardy, being stupid or, you know, dangerous,
being adventurous or being, you know, totally unaware, right? Being innocent.
I kind of like the fact that they embodied all the qualities of youth,
but put in a situation that is really, really way beyond [them], what [could]
they can expect to come out of [it], right?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>So now that you’ve completed a trilogy, what are you working on now?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong> 
<br>I’m actually working on the sequel now. This one will be the DKD Cold
War. <em>DKD Cold War</em> will be about another young band in the midst
of the rock revolution. They have their own personal issues right smack
[during] the threat of nuclear annihilation. And I think as teenagers back
then, I can recall at that point of time in the eighties, the fear of nuclear
war was very real.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Thank you very much, Boon Lai, for coming down to the studio and sharing
all this with us. I want to now take this interview into a slightly different
direction. So, let me ask you, what’s the hardest thing about creating
a historical graphic novel?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong> 
<br>The research was challenging because I think it’s also the way I did the
research. I wanted to get in as deep as I could.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Complete the sentence. History is...</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong> 
<br>History. History to me is a treasure trove of human drama. I feel it’s
a treasure trove of human drama. Yeah, because, well, human drama – presented
and framed in a certain way, right? It’s rather subjective.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Okay, historical fiction is....</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong> 
<br>The way I did with DKD was, I would look at it as human drama amplified,
but inspired by real events. This is humanity at its best, at its worst,
right? Yeah.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Okay, cool. Boon Lai, thank you very much for joining us on BiblioAsia+.
It’s been a pleasure having you. And I certainly learned a lot. To find
out more about the experiences of Veronica Young, Harris Hamzah and Steve
Bala and all these local musicians who were at one point young and crazy
enough to perform in a war zone, you have to read both Boon Lai’s <a href="https://biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg/vol-20/issue-1/apr-jun-2024/singapore-bands-vietnam-war/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">article</a> in <em>BiblioAsia</em> and
also check out his <a href="https://catalogue.nlb.gov.sg/search/card?recordId=204463645" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">trilogy</a>,
which I believe is in the National Library’s collection. Check it out at
<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg</a>. I once again thank you very much for being
here and good luck on the fourth book!</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong> 
<br>Four, five and six.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Oh wow. Okay, the second trilogy. Hey, good luck then.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Boon Lai</strong> 
<br>The second trilogy. Thanks very much.</p>
<p></p>
