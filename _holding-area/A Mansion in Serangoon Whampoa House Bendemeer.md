#### **In the 19th century, Whampoa’s legendary home was a nexus of wealth, power and extravagant entertainment.**

The name Nam Sang Hua Yuan (南生花园), or Nam-sang Fa-un in Cantonese, may not ring a bell today but in the mid-19th century, it was one of Singapore’s most famous residences, attracting visitors from all over the world. Also known as Whampoa House, it was built by the businessman and community leader Hoo Ah Kay (胡亞基, Hu Ya Ji; better known as Whampoa), and located about 5 km outside the city on Serangoon Road.

#### **An Astute Businessman**

Whampoa was born in the district of Whampoa (present-day Huangpu) in Canton (Guangzhou) in 1815 and arrived in Singapore in 1830 when he was 15. He built his company Whampoa &amp; Co. as a ship chandler, supplying provisions to frigates that docked at the Singapore harbour. As the British Royal Navy’s primary food supplier, he formed a close friendship with Admiral Henry Keppel (Keppel Harbour was named in his honour), who frequently visited Whampoa’s home along with other personnel of the British navy.[^1]

Whampoa’s fortune grew through selling foodstuffs, including bread and baked goods from his Havelock Road bakery, as well as meat and vegetables. He also owned an ice house in Boat Quay that sold ice imported from America.[^2] In the era before refrigeration, ice was a necessary commodity for preserving perishables. Some Russian guests of Whampoa who once dined at his home marvelled at the cold water and beer served, which were kept cool by a system in Whampoa’s deep cellar that uses nitre, or saltpetre (potassium or sodium nitrate).[^3]

Whampoa’s business interests eventually intersected with politics and diplomacy.&nbsp; In 1869, he was appointed a member of the Legislative Council and within a few years was made an extraordinary member of the Executive Council, the first and only Chinese to have held this seat. He was also appointed Vice Consul to Singapore for Russia in 1867 and Consul for China in 1877. In 1879, the Japanese government appointed him Vice Consul for Japan thus making him a consul for three foreign countries.”[^4]

#### **An Opulent Abode**

Whampoa’s mansion became renowned for its sumptuous dinners and elaborate Chinese New Year celebrations that drew hundreds to its sprawling gardens, as well as countless parties attended by foreign dignitaries from China,[^5] Russia, Japan and the United Kingdom. Both Whampoa and his residence captured the attention of travel writers from around the world.

The Russian novelist Ivan Aleksandrovich Goncharov provides an extensive description of his 1853 visit to Whampoa’s home in his book, _The Voyage of the Frigate Pallada_, first published in 1858_._ According to Goncharov his account did not capture even one-twentieth of the home’s true beauty and magnificence. Visitors entered through “a finely carved door” to find walls and furniture “exquisitely carved and sculpted”. Soft drapes “woven with gold thread and embroidered with silver ones” adorned the space. Goncharov noted that the furnishings blended “European comfort and Oriental opulence”.[^6]

Photographs of the house in Whampoa’s time show that it combined the solid exterior along the lines of Victorian English architecture. Initially constructed in timber around 1840, the house was later expanded with brickwork in 1855. The main entrance with a carriage portico, typical of the period, opened directly into a large and very grand dining room. The house was flanked by verandas, with lounge rooms, bedrooms and more verandas on the second floor. Chinese elements such as the moon gate (a circular or arched opening in a wall or garden structure) – where Whampoa was photographed with his wife and two of his children – were interspersed with gazebos. The 30-acre property included annexes housing the kitchen, stables and living quarters for servants.[^7]

Although Goncharov noted furnishings and objects clearly belonging to women such as jewelled mirrors, dressing tables, jewellery boxes and scented pouches, no women were present when he visited Whampoa. Knowing that Whampoa had three wives, their absence mystified him. To cap the visit that included a tour of Whampoa’s famous gardens, the Goncharov and his companions were treated to a feast “of countless delicacies”.[^8]

While the house was impressive, it was Whampoa’s splendid gardens that elicited awe and admiration from visitors. In 1876, the world traveller August Daniel Frederickson visited Whampoa’s home and described it in his book, _Ad Orientum_ (1889). Frederickson wrote: “Mr Whampoa, a rich Chinese merchant, has a large property in the neighbourhood, its gardens laid out after the fashion of the country of his birth, trim hedges, box and myrtle trained and clipped to shapes of animals, junks, etc., tiny watercourses, and miniature bridges.” He noticed a little stream with gold fish passing under the mansion’s central portion, forming an open gallery – a concept similar to the open air well found in many Peranakan houses – and supported by a high bridge that allowed a boat to pass underneath.[^9]

Frederickson also extolled the beauty of Whampoa’s world-famous Vitória-Régia water lilies&nbsp; (_Victoria amazonica_; the second largest in the water lily family) floating on what he called a “diminutive lake”. Each flower measured a foot (30.5 cm) across, while the circular leaves ranged from 4 to 6 ft (122–183 cm) in diameter with a raised rim of two to three inches (5–7.5 cm).[^10] Whampoa’s pet poodle loved running about on the leaves, a sight that never failed to amuse visitors.

Whampoa also had an aviary with peacocks and a “piggery” where fat, enormous pigs were kept, with some measuring 7 ft (213 cm) from snout to tail. To Frederickson’s satisfaction, the piggery was “wonderfully clean and neat in all its arrangements”.[^11] Topping it all was Whampoa’s menagerie housing a vicious cassowary that often attacked unwary visitors, some monkeys and a silvery-white Arabian horse.[^12]

Besides Whampoa House, Whampoa owned several other commercial and private establishments, including the plot of land bounded by Grange Road and River Valley Road (where the Spring Grove condominium project stands today). It remains unknown whether Whampoa lived in one of the three modest houses on this allotment before selling the land in 1849 to focus on developing the house and grounds on Serangoon Road.[^13]

In choosing a location away from the city, Whampoa pioneered a trend that other wealthy Chinese would emulate in the 1890s. He recognised how a home’s size, opulence and novelty could serve both as a symbol and a statement of social standing. However, not all of Whampoa’s businesses, particularly the ones jointly held with Europeans, did well.[^14] The _Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser_ noted that, “towards the latter end of his life… Whampoa had to restrict his former lavish expenditure”.[^15]

**New Owner, New Name**

After Whampoa’s death in 1880,[^16] Seah Liang Seah, one of Singapore’s wealthiest and most prominent Chinese towkays, purchased Nam Sang Hua Yuan in the late 1890s. He renamed it “Bendemeer”,[^17] at the suggestion of Governor of the Straits Settlements Charles Mitchell, or Ming Li Yuan (明丽园) in Chinese.[^18]

[^3]:  Whampoa may have known about the ancient Chinese formula for making ice using nitre.&nbsp; It was possible that he may have also tried initially to make ice on site. However, it became evident that going into partnership with Frederic Tudor, the so-called “Ice King” was more feasible. Rather than making ice artificially, Tudor carved&nbsp; natural ice from frozen American rivers and sent the blocks downstream to ports where the blocks of ice were loaded into the cargo holds of ships.

These included 25 hectares to the government for the establishment of what is today the Singapore Botanic Gardens. Another lesser-known recipient of his largesse was Raffles Girls’ School which received his financial donations at its foundation in 1879.
