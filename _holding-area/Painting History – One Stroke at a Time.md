#### **When landscapes and street markets disappear, visual artist Yip Yew Chong preserves them in their fading glory, recreating paintings informed by maps, memory and archival photos.**
By Ruth Wee
<br><small>10 December 2025</small>

In a city where continuous progress is often at conflict with preservation, old buildings tend to make way for gleaming new structures. Landmarks that once stood on solid ground now reside solely in memory, their physical presence replaced by modernisation.

To remember old landscapes, visual artist Yip Yew Chong relies on his paintbrush. His journey began in 2015 when he convinced a homeowner to let him paint a mural of a barbershop on a wall for free. This eventually resulted in a plethora of murals scattered around Singapore today. These murals typically reflect scenes of everyday life in a bygone Singapore.[^1] Yip has since expanded his artistic repertoire to include canvas paintings, digital artworks and even painting on household items, skilfully documenting his impressions of the Singapore he grew up in.[^2]

#### **Beyond Mere Nostalgia**

Many of Yip’s works are scenes based on Singapore’s past. These works rely on a combination of memory, research and imagination. “Trengganu Street Market” (2020) captures a wet market scene from the 1970s. This work in his _Stories from Yesteryear_ series (2017–21) features itinerant hawkers selling their wares at makeshift stalls along Sago Street, Smith Street, Temple Street and Pagoda Street, sheltered from the elements by scant canvas material stretched across poles.[^3]

In 1983, most of these street hawkers were resettled into Chinatown Complex (originally known as Kreta Ayer Complex), emptying the streets of Chinatown of its bustling market life.[^4] For Yip, painting this lively scene in Chinatown evoked vivid memories and allowed him to relive his childhood – something he hopes his paintings do for other Singaporeans too. “I am conscious of how my work affects people,” he said in a book about his work, _Art of Joy_. “As much as my art is drawn from my imagination, it also lives through the imagination of the people who see it.”[^5]

In works like “Trengganu Street Market”, Yip was drew from his own memories growing up in Chinatown. However, in other works, archival research and old photographs play a bigger role. In “Preparing for the Haj” (2020), the canvas captures a cross-section of Bussorah Street bustling with activities surrounding the Haj preparations, with the grand Masjid Sultan (Sultan Mosque) in the background.[^6]

The work shows, among other things, two men walking down Bussorah Street, jointly carrying a trunk, while several others load luggage onto trucks as women gather nearby, waiting to bid farewell to departing pilgrims. These two elements in the painting were inspired by photograps that can be found in the National Archives of Singapore.

“I imagined these viewpoints based on a mixture of old street level photos, present day aerial views (Google Maps), and old maps. Most scenes show condensed versions of real places, selectively showcasing the more iconic or representative infrastructures and leaving out the more repetitive buildings around them. It is like a composite drawing but painted in a more realistic than illustrative style.”[^7]

#### **A Personal Connection**

Some of his paintings also weave in tiny personal stories. His 2019 painting, “New Year’s Eve”, depicts an older woman waiting alone in her room while Yip’s family enjoys a reunion gathering in the adjoining room – a deliberate and sharp contrast highlighting isolation amid celebration.
