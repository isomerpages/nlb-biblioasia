####  Lee Kong Chian Research Fellow _Desmond Wee_ ponders the Singaporean identity while being a tourist in Singapore.

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*"To tourists around the world over, the Merlion is the <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;tourism symbol of Singapore. To the architects of <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;independent Singapore, it is the story of a concept that <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;worked. To the travel industry, it is a souvenir spinner <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;and an icon that helps to sell Singapore overseas."* <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Pamelia Lee (2004: 99)
