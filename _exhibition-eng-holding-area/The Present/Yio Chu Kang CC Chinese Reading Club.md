**About**:	Our book discussion programme commenced on 20 July 2009 with our inaugural session exploring "Oh! Xiangxue", marking the beginning of what has become a sustained monthly tradition of literary engagement. During the pandemic period, we successfully transitioned to online discussions, demonstrating our resilience and commitment to maintaining literary connections despite physical distancing requirements. When community centre renovations temporarily displaced our usual meeting space, we gratefully utilised the facilities at Ang Mo Kio Public Library, showcasing the collaborative spirit that defines our reading community. Our engagement extends beyond our regular sessions to include participation in annual World Book Day celebrations, connecting us with the broader literary community and reinforcing our commitment to promoting reading culture. We have been privileged to host distinguished local authors for exclusive book discussions whose insights have enriched our understanding and appreciation of contemporary literature.
