title: "Sustaining City State Singapore: Exploiting Global Hinterlands, Leaving
  Footprints Behind"
permalink: /vol-8/issue-2/Jul-2012/singapore-global-hinterlands-footprints/
description: There is a global quest for states and communities to find pathways
  to sustainable living. In the last 45 years, Singapore has come a long way in
  developing a more sustainable system of intra-urban living. The secret to
  Singaporeâ€™s success is taking care of its brown issues (refuse disposal,
  littering, sewerage, modern sanitation, clean water and energy) through public
  housing, innovating and managing urban transport systems, and reducing its
  water footprint by recycling and conserving water as well as creating more
  reservoirs.
