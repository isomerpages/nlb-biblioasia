#### A sailor travels halfway around the world in his attempt to return home, and becomes the first Japanese resident in Singapore in the process. **Bonny Tan** tells the story.

During the Edo period (1603–1868) under the rule of the Tokugawa Shogunate,[^1] Japan was a very insular society and kept its doors closed to foreign influence. Japanese nationals leaving the country could not return home on pain of death, and foreigners were barred from entering the country. Only Nagasaki on southernmost Kyushu island remained open as a primary trading port for the Dutch East India Company. This period of national isolation called *sakoku* (meaning literally “closed country”) was in force for over 250 years until Commodore Matthew Perry of the US arrived with his fleet in 1853 to wrest open Japan to foreign trade.
