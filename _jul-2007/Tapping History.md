  trees with their dark green leaves. A century and a half ago, the Taban Merah

  centre of an earth-shaking infocomm revolution as great as the introduction of

#### I've been through Taban Valley at Bukit Timah Nature Reserve many times and never realised until recently how historically important these unprepossessing trees are. To the uninitiated, they look like skinny durian trees with their dark green leaves. A century and a half ago, the Taban Merah (Pafaquium gutta), better known to the world as Gutta Percha, was at the centre of an earth-shaking infocomm revolution as great as the introduction of the Internet.

#### **Discovery**

Gutta Percha was traditionally used in this region to fashion handles for tools. However, it was unknown to the West except for a single specimen called 'mazer wood' in the collection of naturalist John Tradescant (1608â€“1652). The Tradescant collection grew to become Oxford's present Ashmolean Museum.

In 1842, an enterprising Malay man started selling Gutta Percha whips in Singapore. Unfortunately. I have not been able to discover this man's name anywhere. By 1843, his whips were available in London. However, Gutta Percha whips never became more than a novelty.
