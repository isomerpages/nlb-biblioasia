Soon after Singapore gained independence in 1965, the government announced that English would be the *lingua franca* that would unite the linguistically diverse 
population. But attempts to forge a common language in Singapore had begun as early as the 19th century, when Chinese migrants to Singapore – the majority of 
whom spoke Southern Min dialects (闽南语) such as Hokkien1 – tried to communicate with the Malay-speaking indigenous population. Several Chinese-Malay dictionaries – listing Malay words with their equivalent 
terms in Chinese – were produced in the 19th century.2
One of the earliest was *Hua yi tong yu* (华夷通语), published in 1883.
