#### This time-honoured festival has left no tangible trace of its observance in Singapore. **Tan Chui Hua** pieces together oral history interviews to reconstruct its proper place in Chinese culture.

<div style="background-color: white;">The Seven Sisters Festival is based on the Chinese legend of the Weaver Girl and the Cowherd. When Weaver Girl fell in love with the mortal Cowherd, their union incurred heavenly wrath. As punishment, the two were banished to either side of the Milky Way and could only meet once a year – on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month. This painting 天河配 (“Rendezvous in the Milky Way”, c. late 19th–c. early 20th century) depicts the reunion of the couple at the heavenly river (天河), which symbolises the Milky Way. <i>Image source: Wikimedia Commons (painting from the collections of the State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg, Russia).</i></div>

“In those days, what was most distinctive about Chinatown was the seventh day of the seventh month… on the night of the sixth day, they would have started… what was called the seven sisters’ festival, or qi jie jie (七 姐节)… women, single young women, particularly admired the story of the love between the Weaver Girl and the Cowherd. So, on the sixth day of [the] seventh month, it would be a festival for women… they would take the crafts they had made, very exquisite, beautiful handicrafts, and display them… they would put them on very long tables, place all the crafts there, and some offerings for the seven sisters; fruit, rouge, powder, embroidered clothes – very beautiful embroidered clothes for the seven sisters – and hang them up, and the women would come on the sixth to worship the seven sisters”.1

The poignant tale of The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl (牛郎织女) is well loved across East Asian cultures. Its themes of separation, reunion and unwavering devotion in the face of divine wrath inspire memorialisation in the form of religious festivals and rituals, observed on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month.2

The festivals go by various names and forms: the Chinese know it as the Seven Sisters Festival (七姐节/七姐诞), Qixi (七夕节) or Qiqiao (乞巧节), while the Japanese and Koreans call it Tanabata and Chilseok respectively.

In Singapore, the annual celebration to commemorate the legend of the Weaver Girl and Cowherd was brought here by immigrant Chinese communities, notably Cantonese female servants sworn to celibacy. Known as *zishunu* (自梳女) or women who “combed their hair up by themselves”, they are more commonly called *amah* or *majie* in Cantonese) (妈姐) here, as many of them took up work as domestic help in Singapore.3

For a period in Singapore history, the observance of the Seven Sisters Festival was a much anticipated annual highlight in Chinatown, where the Cantonese community used to be concentrated.4 All across Chinatown, worship altars and displays of crafts and artworks would be set up on the eve of the festival by clan associations and sisterhoods, attracting throngs of visitors late into the night.

By the late 1970s, however, the scale of this observance had greatly diminished. Today, the Seven Sisters Festival exists only in the fading memories of former Chinatown residents.
