Loke Wan Tho (1915–64) was a man with wide interests; he was a film magnate, a support of local sports, a photographer and an ornithologist. His niece, Choo Meileen, chairwoman of Cathay Organisation, called him a renaissance man.[^1]

<h4>A Pioneer in Local Film Production </h4>
 In 1953, Loke Wan Tho set up Cathay-Keris with Ho Ah Loke, expanding the Cathay film distribution business into film production. Cathay-Keris was Singapore’s second film studio and was a competitor to Shaw’s Malay Film Productions. These were the only two film studios in Singapore for the next 20 years, which was known as the golden age of the studios.[^2]

Cathay-Keris focused on Malay films, as Malaya had a fast-expanding film market. In 1951, the Cathay’s International Associated Theatres generated twice as much revenue from Malaya compared to Singapore.[^3]

To learn about moviemaking, Loke visited film studios in India in 1957 and invited Hollywood actors to coach Cathay-Keris’s new actors. At that time, Malay cinema was influenced by Indian culture, as the two film studios hired Indian directors, who were better at making Malay films than their Chinese counterparts.[^4]
