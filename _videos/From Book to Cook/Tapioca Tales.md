#### **Episode summary** ####
Because of a rice shortage during the Japanese Occupation, people ate sweet potato and tapioca instead. Writer and cookbook author Lee Geok Boi shows us what the human imagination is capable of by taking these humble root vegetables and turning them into two delicious dishes, using only ingredients that were available in Japanese-occupied Singapore.

#### **Recipes**
Geok Boi's recipes are inspired by tapioca noodles sold and distributed as rations during the Japanese Occupation, and memories of her father's tapioca dessert. Tapioca, as well as sweet potato, replaced rice as a staple during the war, because it was an easy crop to cultivate and took only three months to mature.

<b>Tapioca noodles</b>
<br>Makes about 500 g of noodles, serves 4
<br>300 g tapioca*
<br>150 g tapioca starch 
<br>1½ tsp. salt
<br>fish sauce
<br>chilli
<br>ginger
<br> clams
<br>Chinese celery
<br>*For sweet potato noodles, use 300 g of sweet potato instead of tapioca, and 300 g of tapioca starch instead of 150 g. 

1. In a small pot, mix the tapioca chunks with one rice bowl of water and bring it to a boil. Turn down the heat and simmer till tapioca is very tender. Add a little more water if necessary. Cool well, then mash the tapioca till fairly smooth, taking care to remove the tough string in the centre. The boiled tapioca can be mashed into the boiling water, if there is any left.  
2. In a mixing bowl, mix the mashed tapioca, tapioca starch and grated tapioca together with salt. Add enough coconut milk or water and knead well to form a medium-firm dough. 
3. Shape into rolls or flat cakes. 
4. Have ready a pot of boiling water. Drop the rolls or cakes into the boiling water. 
5. Boil till the cakes float up and turn translucent. It does not matter if cakes are not completely cooked through.
6. Scoop out the cakes and leave them in a large bowl of cold water.
7. Cut the cakes into preferred thickness of noodles. 
8. Heat oil in a wok and lightly fry the aromatics till fragrant. 
9. Add clams, fish sauce (or salt) and noodles to the wok. 
10. Add enough water for gravy and bring it to a boil to meld the flavours. 
11. Serve hot with sprinkling of chopped herbs. 


<b>Boiled tapioca with grated coconut</b>
<br>500 g tapioca, peeled and cut into chunks
<br>200 g gula melaka or to taste
<br>1/2 tsp. salt 
<br>500 ml water / thin coconut milk ( coconut milk optional) 
1. Put all ingredients into a pot and boil till tapioca chunks are done, fluffy and dryish. 
2. Add more water if needed. The amount of water needed will depend on the size of chunks. 
3. To check for doneness, stick a fork into the largest piece. It should break up. 
4. When little liquid is left, stir and turn over the tapioca frequently to prevent burning, though a few burnt spots are fragrant. 
5. To serve, sprinkle freshly grated coconut or top with a squeeze of coconut cream.
