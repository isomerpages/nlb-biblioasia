#### **Episode summary** ####
Khir Johari, food historian and award-winning author of _The_ _Food of Singapore Malays_ (2021), makes _mee maidin_ – a noodle dish based on a krill ragù – and tells us more about its origins. Why does a 1986 cookbook call it “mee mahdin”? And how was krill, once abundant in Singapore’s waters, caught using traditional fishing methods?

#### **Recipes**

Khir learnt how to make _mee maidin_ from Nordin (whom he called Wak Din), a man who used to sell the dish commercially at 34 Bussorah Street, formerly known as Kampong Kaji, in Kampong Glam.

According Khir’s research, Nordin inherited the recipe from Hussein, a migrant from South India who created the dish when he settled in Kampong Glam. Hajjah Asfiah Haji Abdullah, who wrote the 1986 cookbook, _Hidangan Warisan Kita_ (_Our Heritage Dishes_), featured the recipe in her book and named the dish “Mee Mahdin” – likely in honour of Nordin and his wife, Salmah.
