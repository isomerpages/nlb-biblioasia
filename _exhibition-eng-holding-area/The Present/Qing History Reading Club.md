**About**:	To cultivate public interest in historical scholarship and promote Chinese reading culture, Qing History Society Singapore established its reading club in April 2015, creating a dedicated platform for regular literary and historical engagement. The club has developed an innovative approach to historical education that extends far beyond traditional book discussions. Alongside our carefully selected readings, we employ engaging speeches by subject matter experts, curated film and television works that bring historical periods to life, and interactive digital tools that enhance comprehension and retention. Since our inception, we have successfully conducted over 60 book discussion activities, each focusing exclusively on works related to Qing history.
