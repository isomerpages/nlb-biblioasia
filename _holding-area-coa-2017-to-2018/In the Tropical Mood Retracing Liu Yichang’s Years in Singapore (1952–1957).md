#### **Introduction**
In 2000, a new generation was introduced to Hong Kong writer Liu
Yichang (刘以鬯, 7 December 1918 – 8 June 2018) through the technicoloursaturated
imagery of Wong Kar Wai’s *In the Mood* for Love and *2046*, two
films inspired by Liu’s seminal novels *Tête-bêche* (《对倒》) and *The Drinker*
(《酒徒》, which was considered the first stream-of-consciousness Chinese
novel) respectively. The films’ protagonist, a cigarette-puffing newspaper
editor and pulp-novelist played by actor Tony Leung, was also loosely based
on Liu himself.

Wong’s films may have been set in Hong Kong in the 1960s, but the prime
of Liu’s life had been a decade earlier in Singapore in the 1950s, where he,
aged 34, experienced the golden era of Singapore’s tabloids, was initiated
into the glitzy *getai* (歌台, live revue) world, fell in love with a beautiful
songstress and married a dancer with a beautiful heart.

The diasporic twinning of Hong Kong and Malaya due to political and
historical events of the time created a wealth of opportunities that prompted
the exchange of commerce, talents and culture. Malaya’s post-war demand
for Chinese talents in the publishing and entertainment industries had made
Liu’s, and his wife’s, brief stint in Malaya possible, thereby shaping his
personal and literary life forever.

In 1952, Liu was headhunted to join the high-profile but short-lived paper
*Ih Shih Pao* (益世报, ISP) in Singapore. He returned to Hong Kong in 1957,
ill and disillusioned, after several false starts at establishing his newspaper
career. From then on, Liu, as a novelist based in Hong Kong, continued
a long and prolific relationship with Singapore’s *Nanyang Siang Pau*,
publishing more than 60 Malayan short stories between 1958 and 1959,
followed by an unbroken serialisation of 55 novels from 1970 to 1985,
out of which three were set in Singapore.

On the occasion of his centenary, my paper retraces Liu’s Malayan years and
attempts to make sense of his life and time here through newspaper archives,
newly unearthed novels and published works, as well as interviews with his
wife and close friends in Singapore.

This paper examines the overlapping influence of the two distinct but
connected worlds that Liu Yichang inhabited in Singapore, specifically the
tabloid industry and *getai* inner circle, which led to the intertwining of the
two personas in his inner world, namely the “newspaper man” (报人, often
featured in his stories and novels) and the “storyteller who entertained the
public” (娱乐大众的小说家). A chronicler of mid-20th-century Singapore
society, Liu created a rich body of Malayan work that, though sadly neglected,
deserves to be preserved and celebrated as part of our cultural heritage.

#### **First Cut is the Deepest**

In June 1952, Liu Yichang had been living in a room on the fourth floor of
Nanyang Khek Community Guild (南洋客属总会) when he came to head
the *Fukan* (副刊, supplement) of the new Chinese newspaper, *Ih Shih Pao*.1
A 10-minute walk down Peck Seah Street, a left turn on Gopeng Street and a right turn took him to his office on Anson Road. He had arrived in
Singapore with four Hong Kong veteran editors, Chung Wen Ling
(钟文苓), Liu Wenqu (刘问渠), Zhao Shixun (赵世洵) and Zhang Bingzhi
(张冰之). Together, they were known as the Five Tigers from Hong Kong.
The newspaper was launched on 7 June 1952, and a well-attended cocktail
party was held at the Cathay Restaurant on 14 June. At the occasion were
the who’s who of Singapore – government officials, Chinese community
leaders and business organisation representatives.2 The paper’s future looked
promising. Liu Yichang did not expect to lose his first job in Singapore in
less than four months.

On 13 October 1952, *Nanyang Siang Pau* (NYSP) reported the abrupt closure
of Liu’s paper: “At 6am yesterday, *Ih Shih Pao* locked down its office and
posted a notice announcing the suspension of its operation.” The headline
read: “Three Years of Preparation and They Lasted Four Months”. Fortyseven
of the 120 workers were editorial staff and all had been locked out
of the building with their personal belongings still inside. Some journalists
only found out that they were out a job after they had returned from
their assignments.3

Liu should have seen it coming. The paper had already run into financial
difficulty barely a month after its launch, and, from mid-August, was unable
to pay its employees.4 Three editorial staff, including Zhao Shixun and Chin
Kah Chong (陈加昌, who joined Pan-Asia News Agency in 1955 and became
Singapore’s first Vietnam War correspondent), submitted a letter signed
by all staff to the labour office to seek recourse in recouping salaries and
severance pay owed to them.5

The exact dates and chronology of Liu’s movements during this time are
muddled. Liu’s biographer, Yi Mingshan (易明善), wrote that the paper had
run into dire financial difficulty by end July. Liu and his four Hong Kong
colleagues negotiated with the publisher and, failing to get him to sort out the finances, quit and left (“罢笔而去，离开《益世报》”). B.H. Tay, a
Singapore Chinese-newspaper historian, however, wrote that the editors had
merely gone on “strike” (实行“罢笔”).6 Yi also wrote that “After leaving *Ih
Shih Pao* by end July, Liu was welcome onboard [at] *Sin Lit Pau* (新力报) as
its chief editor”.7 But ISP’s assistant manager had told NYSP two days after
ISP’s shutdown that “they had notified immigration authorities to prohibit
the Hong Kong employees from staying in Singapore”,8 suggesting that Liu
and the other Hong Kong editors had still been in ISP’s employ until its
closure in October.

One can only imagine Liu’s devastation – the sudden shock of losing his
job, the anger at being unpaid for months (Liu was also battling his ex-wife
over alimony during this time9), and being told that he could no longer stay
in Singapore. A *Lianhe Zaobao* write up on ISP’s rout quoted a line from
Liu’s story “Old Wong” (老王): “It was a weekend afternoon. I walked to
work and was shocked to see the news centre’s door tightly shut…it felt like
someone had punched me in the stomach…everything around me suddenly
lost its balance”.10

The unfortunate debacle at ISP was to set the tone for Liu’s news career in
Malaya over the next six years, playing out against the exciting but volatile
backdrop of the 1950s Chinese tabloid boom. This tide had brought Liu to
Singapore’s shores, but it would also slosh him around from paper to paper.
In Liu’s words, “It was hard for tabloids to survive. After one collapsed,
another one would soon be set up, but it wouldn’t be long before it also
went down”.11

#### **The Tabloid Boom**
The decade of the tabloid boom up until 1959 saw the publication and
subsequent demise of over 40 tabloids due to declining readership, financial
difficulties and poor management.12 The tabloid boom also coincided with
the Malayan Emergency, a period that saw the government frequently
banning publications for politically subversive content or shutting them
down as a result of the Anti-Yellow Culture Movement. Liu, who had
worked for up to 10 tabloids, bore witness to the heady rise and fall of this
golden age of tabloid publishing. After ISP, Liu briefly worked as the chief
editor for *Sin Lit Pau* before he was poached by *Lien Pang Daily News*
(《联邦日报》) to head the paper in Kuala Lumpur in 1953.13

Although virtually nothing has been written about Liu’s brief stay in Kuala
Lumpur, *Popular Melodies* (《时代曲》), Liu’s thinly-veiled *roman à clef* (that
has not been read since the end of its serialisation in NYSP in 1971) helps
plug the gap. *Popular Melodies*’ narrator, Zhu Shangren (诸尚仁), bears an
uncanny resemblance to Liu. Like Liu, Zhu had also come to Malaya from
Hong Kong to work for a newspaper that had quickly folded, causing him
to move from one paper to another. Zhu’s response on how he ended up
in KL could have been words spoken by Liu himself: “The newspaper I was
working for was going through financial difficulties. I had wanted to go
back to Hong Kong. It so happened that this paper in Kuala Lumpur was
restructuring, and the person in charge came to Singapore to put together
a new team. That’s how I ended up here”.14 Eventually, Zhu was given the
opportunity to head another tabloid back in Singapore, and he took up
the offer even though “the paper treats me well here, but life here is too
monotonous. Singapore would suit me better. As a city, Singapore is more
vibrant than Kuala Lumpur”.15

In a 2016 interview, Liu provided behind-the-scenes insight into the tabloid
newsroom: “I took a train to Kuala Lumpur, and when I first arrived at
*Lien Pang Daily News*, I realised that they didn’t even have a proofreader.

I had to do all the editing, proofreading and layout, from first to last page,
all by myself”.16 “Small Papers” (referencing the Chinese term for tabloids)
summed up the scale of their set-ups, which required everyone, including
the editors, to wear multiple hats. While in Singapore, Liu befriended the
famous Singapore calligrapher and writer Chua Boon Hean (蔡文玄, whose
pseudonym was Liu Beian (柳北岸)), and often played mahjong at his home.
Chua’s son, Chua Lam, a famous Hong Kong columnist, recalled: “It was a
pleasure watching [Liu] play mahjong. When the paper called in the middle
of their mahjong sessions, he would ask me to set up a side table with
writing papers. He treated it like a sewing machine, churning out the articles
while he was waiting for the other players to discard their tiles”.17

Back in Singapore, Liu worked for two papers chaired by the Kuala
Lumpur construction tycoon Low Yat (刘西蝶). Liu was the supervising
editor at *Chung Shing Jit Pao* (《中兴日报》, CSJP) at 110 Robinson Road.
The broadsheet struggled with its declining readership and often ran into
financial difficulties. Liu later became editor and writer at the tabloid *Feng
Bao* (《 锋报》, FB), which was launched in 1953. Chen Mingzong, his friend
and former colleague at ISP, was its chief editor. With its smaller set-up,
FB’s sales and distribution thrived. It had a high circulation of 20,000
copies, and was crowned the King of the Tabloid (小报王). Liu left soon after
its inception, but was rehired in 1954.18

Tabloids of this era were all very competitive, with each vying for its niche
audience. Some specialised in entertainment news. The Shaw Brothers film
studio published *Entertainment News* (《娱乐报》) to promote its films and
stars, while *Happy News* was one of the many tabloids that reported on the
latest *geta*i news, their songstresses and cabaret girls. Some tabloids took
a salacious approach, running pornographic stories and visuals to attract
a certain demographic. But not all tabloids were fluff. Some specialised in
news from communist China during the Cold War, while others like FB
specialised in the exposé of corrupt and illegal activities.19 For Liu, working for such a paper was not without thrill and danger. Soon after its launch,
FB exposed an illegal gambling ring in Kuala Lumpur that specialised in
*tse fa* (字花). The crime lord threatened to hurl hand grenades into the FB newsroom, but the paper would not back down, and eventually helped the police crush the organisation.20

Despite enjoying increasing sales, FB was banned on 30 September 1955 by
the Malayan government for posing a risk to public security.21 Liu then
moved to *Life News* (《生活报》), a new publication launched by the FB
team on 25 October 1955, followed by *Shieh Pau* (《狮报》) in September 1956. On 24 December 1955, Chen Mingzong, FB’s former chief editor
launched a new tabloid *Ti Press* (《铁报》) with his brother Chen Qing
(陈清), and Liu became its chief writer. *Ti Press* invested a great deal
of money in its high-quality tritone printing, which gave its images
greater tonal range. Unfortunately, *Ti Press*’ sales and distribution were
disappointing and Liu left when the paper reverted to the economical
black-and-white duotone printing for its ninth issue. Interestingly, the
paper’s sales picked up under a new editorial team. In March 1956, when
Hong Kong movie superstar Li Lihua came to Singapore for the location
shoot of the film *Rain Storm in Kreta Ayer* (风雨牛车水) which opened on
18 September 1956), *Ti Press* ran daily behind-the-scenes reports, which
resulted in soaring sales. About a year later, *Kang Pao* (《钢报》) was
launched on 17 November 1956 with Liu as its chief editor, but he left
after three issues.22

#### **Fighting a Lost Cause?**
Despite the distressing instability of his job, one thing remained constant
for Liu: his love for literature and his quest to promote modern literature
through the papers. Liu had always been or doubled up as the editor of
the *Fukan* literary section, a unique platform in Chinese newspapers that
had been instrumental in shaping the identity of Malayan – and after
Singapore’s departure from the Federation of Malaysia – Malaysian and
Singaporean Chinese literature. Liu was undoubtedly the best choice for
such a role, as he had been editing literature for a decade before he came to Singapore. In his birth place of Shanghai, Liu had become the editor for
the modern literature section of *Peace Daily* (《和平日报副刊》) in December 1945. A year later, he quit and founded his own publishing company, Huai
Zheng Culture Publishing Company (怀正文化社). In 1948, when civil war
in China escalated, Liu escaped to Hong Kong. To make ends meet, he
became the *Fukan* editor of several newspapers. Though recognising that “it
is impossible to live on literature in Hong Kong”, Liu always found ways to
“let serious literature live off commercial publications”.23

Liu continued to negotiate the divide between literature and commercial
writing in Singapore. His innovative and beautifully illustrated layouts for
*Bieshu* (别墅), the literary section of *Ih Shih Pao*, showcased his modern
sensibility. For instance, in response to a story that compared slummers to
caged birds, Liu pasted cut-outs of pigeons throughout the page, breaking
the lines between the articles.24 Despite working for the tabloids, Liu was
still celebrated and respected as a serious writer and champion of modern
Chinese literature. Even as NYSP covered the drama of ISP’s shocking
collapse within its pages, it simultaneously ran advertisements promoting
*Bright Snow* (《雪晴》). *Bright Snow* was Liu’s first novel published in
Singapore (by NYSP) and was initially serialised in *Nanfang Evening Post*
(《南方晚报》), NYSP’s evening paper. Two months later, in December
1952, Liu published his second novel, *Dragon Girl* (《龙女》).25

Outside of his work, Liu was a generous mentor to young writers. Former
*Fukan* editor of NYSP and* Lianhe Zaobao*, Xie Ke (pen-name: 谢克; actual
name: Seah Khok Chua 佘克泉), recalled meeting Liu at a literary event
organised by *Sin Lit Pau* in 1952, when Xie was a novice writer studying
at Chung Cheng High School (branch). Xie would later visit Liu at his
residence at Nanyang Khek Community Guild to seek his advice on writing.
Xie would visit at noon during weekends, as Liu would have worked until
the wee hours of the morning clearing newspaper pages. Liu would buy
him *dim sum* at a nearby teahouse, where they would be entertained by
songstresses singing popular tunes. Sometimes, they would take a trishaw
to catch a new film. Xie said, “He would read all my writing and give me considered advice and criticism. He even gave me a list of contemporary
Chinese authors I [had to] read, and I diligently completed my ‘task’ within
half a year”.26 They went on to become lifelong friends, with Liu calling Xie
“one of my oldest friends in Singapore”.27 When Liu moved to a Singapore
Improvement Trust (SIT) flat on the ground floor of Blk 1 Boon Tiong
Road, diagonally across from Xie who lived in Blk 4, other young writers
continued to knock on Liu’s door for literary advice, and he showed them
the same generosity he had shown Xie.28

However, promoting serious literature in Singapore was not easy. The
youths who loved literature were not readers of the tabloids Liu edited. Blue
collar workers and rural farmers formed 30 percent of their readership, with
ladies of the night and women from the performing industries comprising
about 25 percent. “The bar girls, dance hostesses, songstresses and socialites
were interested in the tabloids because they wanted to be featured in them.
Businessmen only formed 10 percent of the readers, and student readers
were less than 5 percent”.29 If Liu had encountered difficulties in Hong Kong
pushing literature to the masses via their local papers, one can imagine the
far greater resistance from his tabloid publishers concerned with appealing
to the lowest common denominator. His unrelenting quest would only lead
to his disillusionment and disappointment.

Unable to see his future in Singapore, Liu returned to Hong Kong in late 1957. Two years later, on 8 June 1959, four days after the People’s Action
Party won the election by a landslide, the Ministry of Home Affairs
banned six obscene tabloids, including *Ti Press*, in an attempt to cultivate
a wholesome society, effectively sounding the death knell for Chinese
tabloids. In a national broadcast, then Home Affairs Minister Ong Pang
Boon said that these obscene tabloids bred an unhealthy view towards life by
portraying a world populated by half-naked licentious women and hooligans
always out to create trouble.30

#### **Sing Sing Sing: The *Getai* Inner Circle**
*Popular Melodies* (《时代曲》), a forgotten novel by Liu serialised in *Nanyang
Siang Pau* in 1971, shows him to be an insider and keen observer of the
vibrant and glitzy *getai* (歌台) at the amusement worlds in Singapore in the
1950s. Actor Bai Yan (白言) and queen of Amoy cinema, Zhuang Xuefang
(庄雪芳), both *getai* icons, became his lifelong friends. This side of Liu
resembles the writer and dandy who would go on to inspire Tony Leung’s
character in Wong Kar Wai’s films *In the Mood for Love* and *2046*.

The novel is an important discovery for two reasons: It offers a rare account
of Liu’s life in Singapore in his own voice, as well as a detailed record of
*getai* in its heyday. The novel starts: “Twenty years ago, Zhu [the novel’s
narrator] came to Singapore from Hong Kong to work for a newspaper…”.
It then goes on to document Zhu’s move to Kuala Lumpur and back to
Singapore – the work is a thinly veiled *roman à clef* that bears an uncanny
similarity to Liu’s own experiences.31

*Popular Melodies* can be read as a companion piece to *Singapore Story*
(《星加坡故事》), an anti-communist melodrama about a newspaper editor’s
romantic entanglement with a getai singer that Liu, lured by the high fee,
wrote in 1957, shortly before his return to Hong Kong, for the magazine
*Story Paper* (《小说报》) which was backed by the United States Information
Service (USIS).32 *Popular Melodies*, written in the 1970s, sans political
agenda, reads more like an eulogy to the vanished *getai* world.

Liu’s connection with *getai* was intrinsically linked to his role as a
newspaper editor. The newspapers, especially tabloids with a strong focus
on entertainment, enjoyed a mutually beneficial relationship with getai
operators: the former needed *getai* artistes to provide exclusive content to
attract readers, while the latter needed the papers to promote their shows
and artistes. Zhuang Xuefang, before starring in a string of Amoy movies
that propelled her to superstardom, was a *getai* star in the early 1950s.
In her interview with me, she recounted her first meeting with Liu at his *Ih Shih Pao* office: “We paid him a visit after hearing about the setting up
of the paper”.33 Liu confirmed that such public relation practices were the
norm in *Popular Melodies*: “The *getai* song and dance troupes came and
went one after another, like revolving figures on the Chinese lantern. Before
the run of each show, each troupe leader would pay their respects to the
newspaper’s top management with their key actors and singers. That was
how Zhu Shangren became acquainted with both local and Hong Kong
*getai* artistes”.34

Zhu’s/Liu’s privileged position as a writer and newspaper editor granted
him insider access to the *geta*i world. Real-life *getai* personalities made
appearances as themselves in Liu’s *roman à clef*. Zhu describes the first
time he was taken backstage: “Tay was chummy with all the singers and
actors, first greeting Zhuang Xuefang and Poon Sow Keng (潘秀琼), then
shaking hands and sharing jokes with Bai Yan and Guan Xinyi (关新
艺)… Zhuang said to Tay, ‘I’ll be performing for a short period in Kuala
Lumpur, but your paper reported that I’d be performing in Borneo. Can
you see to it that the error gets amended?’ Everything looked new and
fresh to Zhu”.35 According to Liu’s wife, Liu had bonded with actor Bai
Yan over their shared philatelic passion.

Liu digressed from *Popular’s* melodramatic storyline to offer commentaries
and observations about the rise of the popular music scene in Malaya and
*getai*’s inner workings. With quick-cutting images, Liu showed how these
Chinese songs, influenced by jazz and other popular Western music genres,
had touched every aspect of society: “Thanks to the blooming of *getai* stages
in towns big and small all over Malaya, the popular music craze has exploded
in the region. Listening to popular songs has become the main recreation for
the masses…from school girls to female workers in rubber shoes factories,
typesetting workshops, pineapple canning factories and fisheries”.36 In Liu’s
novel, Zhu had initially found “these songs low brow, but it was impossible
to not be swept up by their infectious melodies and spell”.37

Like Liu, the fictional Zhu also frequented cinemas when he first arrived in
Singapore, “but after hanging out with the *getai* people, his monotonous
life became more colourful”.38 This is no small wonder when one imagines
the sight and sound of this glitzy, nocturnal world. In the 1950s, *getai* was
at its peak with more than 20 venues offering live performances in the three
“worlds”, or amusement parks, namely Great World, New World (both
owned by Shaw Organisation) and Happy World (owned by Eng Wah
Organisation and later renamed Gay World). These “worlds” that came to
life every night from 6pm to midnight were like the kaleidoscopes of the
modern age.39 Television only arrived in Singapore in 1963, and these worlds
– with several cinemas, restaurants, dancehalls and live venues under each
roof – offered their audiences a mind-boggling selection of entertainment
ranging from wrestling, boxing, strip-tease, Chinese and Malay operas, to
shopping, amusement rides, gaming, cabarets and dancing. Furthermore,
these “worlds” were affordable not just for adults but also for youths,
making them appealing attractions for the whole family.

*Getai*, at its peak, was so wildly popular that it could attract as many as
500 patrons a night, and twice the number on nights when business was
thriving.40 According to Liu, “*Getai*’s programme usually went like this:
from 8pm to around 1030pm, singers would take turns to sing, ending
with a modern play or sketch.” In her memoir, Zhuang Xuefang wrote that
during her Shangri La *getai* days, she had to switch from singing to acting in
the same night, an experience that prepared her for acting in Amoy cinema
in the late 1950s and 1960s.41

Zhuang described Liu as a serious man of letters,42 but backstage dramas
such as the bickering between *getai* pianists and songstresses fuelled his
imagination. In *Popular Melodies*, the fictional Zhu relished these “real-life
dramas… [which were] far more riveting than the sketches on stage”.43 Liu wrote two short stories based on his keen behind-the-scenes observations.
“Troupe Leader” (《团长》) is a sympathetic portrayal of a troupe leader
who had to handle a motley crew of difficult artistes and creditors. The stress
was so great that the man collapsed on stage after announcing “Ladies and
Gentlemen”.44 “Getai” (《歌台》) is a zany comedy about a *getai *owner who
insisted on casting a stripper in the play *The Savage Land* (《原野》) by Cao
Yu (曹禺). In “Getai”, the director had walked out in a fit of anger, but the
true to the owner’s predictions, the queue for the show began forming way
ahead of the play’s 8pm curtain-up.45

Occasionally, Liu would join in the fun and pen Chinese lyrics for Malay
and foreign songs. On 7 August 1952, Liu’s former Hong Kong employer
*Sing Tao Weekly* (《星岛周报》) published five of his poems under the title
*Balinese Charm and Others* (《峇厘风情及其他》).46 In an annotation for the
poem “Balinese Charm”, Liu wrote “I heard [the song] ‘Balinese Island’
(峇厘岛) when I first came to Singapore. The melody was excellent but
the Chinese lyrics were in poor taste. Egged on by my friends, I wrote my
own lyrics to the melody, which became ‘Balinese Charm’ (峇厘风情).” The
song was based on “Pulau Bali”, an Indonesian folk song. Called “Balinese
Island”, the Chinese adaptation was later popularised by Poon Sow Koon.
Reality overlapped with fiction once again when protagonist Zhu recounted
a similar incident in *Popular Melodies*: “Worried that their audience would
get tired of the same old tunes… some singers would seek out Western
and Japanese melodies, and ask Zhu to pen the Chinese lyrics for them.
Although writing lyrics wasn’t his forte, he attempted a few…He found it
most amusing when he heard songs he wrote being performed on stage”.47

By 1971, Liu had perhaps already forgotten about these songs as *Popular
Melodies* made no mention of the songs Zhu had penned, but now, we
know “Balinese Charm” went like this: “I clasp your waist tightly, and you
embrace me passionately. Have you brought life and colours to me because you could see how desolate my life has been?” (我紧紧搂住你的细腰，你疯狂地
将我拥抱。莫非你看透我心境萧条，故意赠我一场热闹。)

Not content to stage just slapstick acts, some *getai* actors and artistes aspired
to put up more serious work. Liu, himself trying to feature more serious
literature in tabloids, probably found them to be kindred spirits. In *Popular
Melodies*, Liu wrote about an actor named Loke who “is an earnest artiste.
He keeps trying to stage famous plays at *getai*.” Liu also offered his candid
opinions of these noble attempts: “As the conditions at *getai* were generally
unfavourable to such staging, some of these plays, even though originally
written by famous playwrights, became crudely adapted sketches. Shangren
had once watched the staging of Cao Yu’s *Thunderstorm* by a *getai* troupe in
Singapore. Despite the best efforts of the cast and crew, the end product was
less than desirable”.48
