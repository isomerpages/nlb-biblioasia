A city without street life is a city without urban vitality. As Jane Jacobs states in The Death and Life of Great American Cities (1972), the life of the city is located in its streets. More than its functional capacity as a conduit for channelling people to different parts of a city, the street characterises it: "If a city's streets look interesting, the city looks interesting; if they look dull, the city looks dull" (Ibid., p. 107). It is through its streets that the city derives its personality, and it is on the streets that the social in the city is made visible. What makes the street a social fact is that "it has always included a set of assumptions about who would own and control it, who would live on it or use it, the purposes for which it was built, and the activities appropriated to it" (Gutman, 1978, p. 250). Indeed, the street is "the place where many of our conflicts or resolutions between public and private claims are accessed or actually played out" (Anderson, 1978, p. 1). It is also "a locus of social interaction and a linear passageway linking destinations" (Levitas, 1978, p. 228). As such, the street is a place where social encounters occur and a site through which the experience of everyday life in an urban environment are lived out. 

Whether as a location for watching street performances, meeting people, communicating with or just enjoying a sense of being with fellow human beings, the street is the predominant source of vitality of a city. It forms the space in which people come together, participate in social exchange, are able to move about freely and enjoy the sociability that the street offers. It is about the presence of people there at different times of the day such that the street is filled with activity for as many hours in a day as possible. Such elements are what Jacobs refers to as urban vitality, and these constitute street life.
