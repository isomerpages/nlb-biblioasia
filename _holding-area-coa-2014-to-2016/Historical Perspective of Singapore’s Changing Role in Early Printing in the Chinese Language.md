#### **Introduction**
From its founding in 1819, modern Singapore has been a multiracial and
multilingual society. The earliest materials printed in Singapore were in
languages such as English, Siamese, Malay, Arabic and Chinese. This
study focuses on early printing in the Chinese language, Singapore’s role
in this development and the impact it made on the Chinese language and
Chinese communities.

This essay starts with a survey of what was published during the 19th
century, followed by a review of what has been studied so far. Based on
these, I examine the changing role of Singapore as a society that enabled
early printing in the Chinese language to take shape, and how this early
availability of printing in the Chinese language impacted the multiracial
and multicultural society.


#### **What Was Published: Output From Early Printing in the Chinese Language**
Due to historical and environmental factors, Singapore’s early efforts
in Chinese-language printing were not well preserved. Despite the
introduction of *The Book Registration Ordinance*, 1886, the situation did not improve, as observed by Cecil Byrd in 1970 when he visited Singapore.
He conducted a survey of early printing in the Straits Settlements, which
was a preliminary exploration of the nascent print industries in the
three settlements.1 Since then, a lot of effort – by local and international
academics, librarians and curators – has been put into compiling a set
of documentation. They have worked to source for samples, including
unrecorded extant titles, so that we now have a better picture of the total
output of such prints.

This study will attempt to compile a list of known titles held by libraries
and archives, listed in special bibliographies and catalogues, as well as
cited by researchers in their dissertations, theses, papers and articles. The
listing will also be supplemented by searching the Online Public Access
Catalogues (OPA C) of the National Library Board (NL B), National
University of Singapore Libraries (NUS Libraries), British Library (BL)
and other libraries specialising in East and Southeast Asian studies.
The resultant listings have been appended as: *Appendix I: A chronology of
printing in the Chinese language, 1825–1902; and Appendix II: A chronology
of printing in romanised Malay and English produced by Straits Chinese,
1889–1902*.

A total of 143 uniform titles were identified as samples of early printing in
the Chinese language, as well as those in romanised Malay and English
produced by the Straits Chinese during the period from 1825 to 1902. The
inclusion of the latter category of printing is due to the fact that they were
works translated from Chinese classics, or written by Chinese and printed or
published by the Chinese press. Together, these constitute the documentary
heritage of the Chinese community in Singapore.
