#### Food writer **Sylvia Tan** remembers the foods and flavours she grew up with and the less than sanitary practices made for stomachs cast in iron.

What could be more off-putting than dipping sticks of charcoal-grilled satay into a communal pot of peanut gravy at a roadside stall literally metres away from belching buses?

Yet I recall that time with sweet nostalgia, quite forgetting the lung-clogging smoke from the buses that ended their journey at the Tay Koh Yat depot along Beach Road, or worse, dipping a half-eaten stick of satay or cube of ketupat (rice cake) into the communal pot shared with goodness knows how many others whoâ€™d just done the same.
