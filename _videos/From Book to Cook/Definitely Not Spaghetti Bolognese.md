#### In the 1987 home economics syllabus, 14-year-old girls were taught how to breastfeed and bathe a baby. How has the syllabus changed over the years? Join food writer Sheere Ng to find out, as she makes a simple pasta dish taught in her home economics class.

#### **Episode summary** ####
Home economics was taught in Singapore schools to train teenage girls to be good homemakers. The changing syllabus for this subject over the different decades tells a story of the “ideal” Singaporean woman and gender roles. Food writer and researcher Sheere Ng explores home economics while making a unique pasta dish, one that she was taught in her home economics class. (Hint: It involves a sauce that normally goes with fries.)

#### **Recipe**
Instead of using lean meat and tomato paste as called for in the 1997 recipe, Sheere was taught to use hot dogs and tomato ketchup instead. In fact, home economics textbooks of the 1990s taught students how to use convenience food with fresh food to make nutritious home-cooked meals. The recipes in those textbooks were simpler, a reflection of the trend that more families were eating out than cooking.
