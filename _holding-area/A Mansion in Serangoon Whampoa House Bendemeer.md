#### **In the 19th century, Whampoa’s legendary home was a nexus of wealth, power and extravagant entertainment.**

The name Nam Sang Hua Yuan (南生花园), or Nam-sang Fa-un in Cantonese, may not ring a bell today but in the mid-19th century, it was one of Singapore’s most famous residences, attracting visitors from all over the world. Also known as Whampoa House, it was built by the businessman and community leader Hoo Ah Kay (胡亞基, Hu Ya Ji; better known as Whampoa), and located about 5 km outside the city on Serangoon Road.

#### **An Astute Businessman**

Whampoa was born in the district of Whampoa (present-day Huangpu) in Canton (Guangzhou) in 1815 and arrived in Singapore in 1830 when he was 15. He built his company Whampoa &amp; Co. as a ship chandler, supplying provisions to frigates that docked at the Singapore harbour. As the British Royal Navy’s primary food supplier, he formed a close friendship with Admiral Henry Keppel (Keppel Harbour was named in his honour), who frequently visited Whampoa’s home along with other personnel of the British navy.[^1]

Whampoa’s fortune grew through selling foodstuffs, including bread and baked goods from his Havelock Road bakery, as well as meat and vegetables. He also owned an ice house in Boat Quay that sold ice imported from America.[^2] In the era before refrigeration, ice was a necessary commodity for preserving perishables. Some Russian guests of Whampoa who once dined at his home marvelled at the cold water and beer served, which were kept cool by a system in Whampoa’s deep cellar that uses nitre, or saltpetre (potassium or sodium nitrate).[^3]

Whampoa’s business interests eventually intersected with politics and diplomacy.&nbsp; In 1869, he was appointed a member of the Legislative Council and within a few years was made an extraordinary member of the Executive Council, the first and only Chinese to have held this seat. He was also appointed Vice Consul to Singapore for Russia in 1867 and Consul for China in 1877. In 1879, the Japanese government appointed him Vice Consul for Japan thus making him a consul for three foreign countries.”[^4]

[^3]:  Whampoa may have known about the ancient Chinese formula for making ice using nitre.&nbsp; It was possible that he may have also tried initially to make ice on site. However, it became evident that going into partnership with Frederic Tudor, the so-called “Ice King” was more feasible. Rather than making ice artificially, Tudor carved&nbsp; natural ice from frozen American rivers and sent the blocks downstream to ports where the blocks of ice were loaded into the cargo holds of ships.
