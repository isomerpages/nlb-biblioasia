#### Singapore is today a well-developed financial centre with many banks and other financial institutions offering a suite of banking products and services. But it was a completely different scene during the colonial era.

#### **Singapore's First Banks**
In the early 19th century, when Stamford Raffles first set foot on Singapore, it was  essentially a small fishing village whose residents relied mainly on barter trade for goods and services. Soon after Raffles established Singapore as an entrepot port, trading activities expanded rapidly, and there naturally arose a need for banking facilities to support the growing number of traders and merchants on the island.

It was first suggested that a bank be established in Singapore in 1833. However,  it was not until 1840 that a branch of the Union Bank of Calcutta was opened here. The bank offered merchants advances on goods to be imported, up to three-fourths of their value at an interest rate of 9 percent. It also provided loans against bullion, up to 90 per cent of its value, with an interest rate of 7 percent. Other banks subsequently opened branches In Singapore - the Oriental Bank in 1846, the Mercantile Bank of India in 1855,  Nederlandsche Handel MaatscNapy. In 1857, Chartered Bank in 1859, and the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank in 1866.

In the beginning, these banks were established primarily for the China trade. Their business was confined to providing trade financing and currency exchange services for traders and merchants plying their trade in the region, and their main clientele was the European mercantile community. 

When it came to dealingv with Chinese traders and merchants, each bank found it expedient to hire a local middleman known as the comprador (Portuguese for "buyer"). The banks lent money to Chinese merchants and traders through the comprador, who was responsible for every Chinese account opened. The comprador was also responsible for hiring and managing all local staff. In the early days, compradors were men with good connections and established family backgrounds.

Until the beginning of the 20th century. the banking system in Singapore consisted mainly of European Banks. It was only at the turn of the 20th century that the first Iocal  banks were established. Kwong Yik Bank was the first Chinese bank: It was set up in 1903 by Wong Ah Fook and several  Cantonese businessmen. The bank's  services included banking facilities, mortgages and loans, and its clientele was mainly Chinese. The second Chinese bank, Sze Hai Tong, was set up in February 1906. One of its directors, Tan Swi Phiau, also held the important position of comprador to 
Netherlands India Commercial Bank.

#### **The Rise of Agency Houses**
Another source of finance for many businesses were agency houses such as Guthrie & Co. Established in the 19th century by colonial pioneers, these companies had started off as trading businesses, but later diversified into non-trading businesses such as banking and finance.

Guthrie & Co., for instance, started off as an import-export establishment.  As the company accrued assets from the profits it made from trading activities, it decided to make good use of the surplus assets by providing finances for other people's business ventures, such as building factories and sawmills in Singapore.  It also provided loans to businesses such as ti-mining and rubber cultivation in the Malay states.
