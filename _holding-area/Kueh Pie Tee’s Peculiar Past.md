#### **Episode summary** ####
Join award-winning cookbook author Christopher Tan as he investigates the mysterious origins of _kueh pie tee_ and its connection to American cuisine, while making the snack from a recipe in Susie Hing’s 1956 cookbook, <i>In a Malayan Kitchen</i>.

Using both local moulds and American “patty irons” dating back to the 1950s–70s, Christopher shows us the different shell shapes that can be made, and how the fillings have changed over time – from cream or milk-based sauces in the Western version to those inspired by the local <i>popiah</i>.

#### **Recipe**
Susie Hing’s recipe is for “Kroket Tjanker (Java Kwei Patti)”, but according to Christopher, there aren’t any Javanese recipes with the same name. One can only speculate that she got the name “kroket” from “croquette”, a deep-fried roll made of a creamy filling wrapped in mashed potato, egg and breadcrumbs. Perhaps she was inspired by the filling of the Dutch-Indonesian croquette, which is almost identical to the filling for her <i>kwei patti</i>.

Christopher used different moulds to make the _pie tee_ shells, including local modern and vintage _pie tee_ moulds, and American moulds.
