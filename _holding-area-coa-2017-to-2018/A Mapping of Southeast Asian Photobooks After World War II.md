#### **Introduction**
There has been a surge in interest in photobooks since 2004, triggered by the
publication of a series of richly illustrated volumes by publisher Phaidon,
such as *The Photobook: A History Volume I (2004), The Photobook: A History
Volume II* (2006) and *The Photobook: A History Volume III* (2014). The
mastermind behind this series is British collector-photographer Martin
Parr, with critic-photographer Gerry Badger as its lead writer. Today, there
are fairs, festivals and symposiums dedicated to the photobook across the
world. It is fair to say that Parr has been hugely responsible for surfacing the
photobook as a field of interest and an object of desire.

In the preface of *The Photobook: A History Volume I*, Parr claims that
the photobook is the “final frontier of the undiscovered” in the research
of photography. Hence, his promotion of the photobook is an attempt
to “narrate a new history of photography”.1 Together, Badger and
Parr position the photobook at the chasms “between the aesthetic and
contextual battalions in the photo-critical wars”, and between art and the
mass medium, offering, in effect, a third way for photographers, curators,
collectors and art historians to approach photography.2

Because the titles featured in these volumes are largely based on Parr’s
enormous collection of photobooks, the selection is inevitably subjective and
eclectic. Materials – such as company books and propaganda publications
– frequently disparaged by art historians, curators and even photographers
themselves receive serious treatment from the series, partly because Parr is
personally invested in these photobooks. In a limited way, this has helped to
broaden the art of photography. Parr adds, “We have gone out of our way to
be inclusive, welcoming books from countries beyond the usual European-
American axis, which are normally overlooked in other histories”.3 Hence,
out of the 472 books chosen for the first two volumes of *The Photobook* series,
some have been placed in the chapter “Other Territories: The Worldwide
Photobook”, while productions from Japan are featured in the chapter,
“Provocative Materials for Thought: The Postwar Japanese Photobook”.

While Parr repeatedly notes that all histories are subjective, what they
have authored here is, of course, a global history written from a European
perspective. This becomes apparent through a casual reading of the writings
in these volumes where the references are overwhelmingly Euro-American
and the arguments intended as universal proclamations. While they claim
to attempt an “unofficial revisionist history” of photography through the
valorisation of photobooks, their account is based on and inevitably bound to
the official historiography, which continues to operate from imperial centres.4

This explains their claim, 10 years after the publication of *The Photobook:
A History Volume I*, that there is now a global photographic culture and
that the “photobook can be said to have been responsible for at least one
conspicuous success in the ongoing story of globalization”.5 Globalisation,
in this sense, refers to the uni-directional export of the photobook craze to
the rest of the world, as there is little evidence in the publications of Parr
and Badger to suggest that photobooks from any place in Asia, for instance,
have significantly impacted communities of practitioners in the imperial
centres. Furthermore, when they make the universalising claim that the
photobook has been more important to the history of creative photography than the mass-media journal or the gallery print, it is clear that experiences
in Southeast Asia have not been taken into account.6

While Parr and Badger assert that they have no interest in creating a new
canon in photography, the Phaidon publications have effectively accelerated
the canonisation and commodification of photobooks, chiefly benefitting
Parr and his associates.7 In effect, their narrative leaves photobook
productions from Southeast Asia outside of history and historiography.
When a photobook from Southeast Asia appears in their selection, it serves
to legitimise their global and eclectic taste. In other words, when they pick
publications from the “peripheral” regions of the world to fit this global
project, their selection inevitably helps to entrench the universality of the
Euro-American narrative of photography.

#### **Defining the Photobook**
Before turning our focus onto Southeast Asia, it is worthwhile to revisit
the ways in which the photobook has been defined in the current spate of
canonisation. To quote Parr and Badger at length:

   *A photobook is a book – with or without text – where the work’s<br>
   primary message is carried by photographs. It is a book authored<br>
   by a photographer or by someone editing and sequencing the work<br>
   of a photographer, or even a number of photographers…. For the<br>
   most part, we have considered the photobook as a specific ‘event’<br>
   … in which a group of photographs is brought together between<br>
   covers, each image placed so as to resonate with its fellows as the<br>
   pages are turned, making the collective meaning more important<br>
   than the images’ individual meanings…. As we define it, the<br>
   photobook has a particular subject – a specific theme…. And<br>
   in the main, it will not simply be a survey of a photographer’s<br>
   ‘greatest hits’, a career review. Monographs, or anthologies of<br>
   a particular photographer’s work at a given time in his or her<br>
   career have therefore not been included.*8
	 
Having provided what seems like an all-encompassing definition of the
photobook, they immediately temper it by including in their selection
the monographs of Henri Cartier-Bresson (*The Decisive Moment*, 1952)
and Walker Evans (*American Photographs*, 1938), while excluding those
made by some of the most important American Pictorialists, such as
Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Weston and Ansel Adams. According to Parr and
Badger, while the publications of the Pictorialists are typically sumptuous
in production, they are more like anthologies than cogent photobooks.9
And yet, in *The Chinese Photobook: From the 1900s to the Present* (2015),
co-edited by Parr – again based on his ever-growing collection – and
WassinkLundgren (with Badger serving as a contributor), anthologies
and exhibition catalogues such as *Peking Light Society Annual* (1929)
and *Holidays in Hong Kong* (1968) from the milieus of Pictorialism are
included in the selection.10 There is no doubt that these are significant
publications in the history of China photography. The same can be said
of the photobooks made by the aforementioned American Pictorialists,
*vis-à-vis* the historiography of American photography. Why do Parr and
his associates treat the productions of American and China Pictorialists
differently? It is beyond the scope of this paper to delve into the question.
But if I may suggest a possible reason, the discrepancy is perhaps due
to the fact that the imprint of the American Pictorialists has already
been fully acknowledged in the history of global photography, whereas
the historiography of China photography remains a work-in-progress,
especially for the English-speaking world. In this context, it is possible that
Parr and WassinkLundgren had felt somewhat obliged to present a history
of China photography via their valorisation of photobooks.

Returning to the issue of definition, U.S.-based Jörg Colberg, a widely
followed proponent of the photobook, offers a slightly different view. He
defines the photobook as a book that is viewed primarily for its photographs.
This is different from a cookbook, for instance, which is probably read for
its recipes rather than photographs.11 In contrast, Parr and Badger devote
a full chapter in *The Photobook: A History Volume II* to the company book because many of the greatest photographers produced books that had been
subsidised and commissioned by commercial corporations.12

Colberg considers albums, catalogues and monographs as the three
subcategories of the photobook, differing from the definition offered by
Parr and Badger. He also uses the term monograph differently from Parr and
Badger, although it is clear that both parties actually valorise the same kind
of object. Colberg demarcates the *monograph* from the catalogue, which
typically does not feature a narrative arc. In contrast, it is very difficult to
remove a photograph or a page from a monograph without dramatically
altering the book. The placement of the photographs and the overall design
create the “connective tissue” that makes the monograph more than just a
sum of its parts.13

Like most proponents of the photobook, Colberg cannot help but speak
of it in a somewhat mythologising manner. He adds, “When a photobook
is made well, it is quite likely that you will not notice many of the great
decisions that went into its making. That, ultimately, is the goal: while
problems with photobooks are like hangnails that can be noticed even by
those who do not know much about photobooks, many of the properties of
perfectly made photobooks can only be appreciated by experts (designers,
book binders, editors) or people who are aware of the various details to look
out for”.14 Parr and Badger express a similar sentiment: “Often the difference
between a great photobook and a good photobook is an indefinable quality
that one recognizes when one sees it”. They add, rather perspicaciously, “Of
course, photobooks have become extremely desirable objects in their own
right. There is an element of fetishism at work”.15

Indeed, the transfer of the photobook hype to Southeast Asia has already
generated a degree of fetishism. A case in point is the setting up of the
Facebook group, ominously titled Photobook Fetish Singapore, by Invisible
Photographer Asia (IPA) in 2015. Fetish for the smell of ink and the sound
of a falling page in a photobook arrived via German printer Gerhard Steidl
through his collaborations with designer Theseus Chan and DECK, a photo gallery in Singapore. Perhaps it is unsurprising that the fetish finds a ready
audience in Singapore, one of the richest nations in Southeast Asia.

These definitions of the photobook have largely been articulated from Euro-
American experiences and universalising desires. While not discounting
their usefulness, they remain problematic on different levels. In this paper,
I will surface and consolidate our experiences in making photobooks across
Southeast Asia since 1945. In this context, it is paramount that we begin with
a definition of the photobook that is as open-ended as possible. This will
hopefully prevent certain types of publications from being excluded simply
because they do not fit within the parameters of existing definitions. Here,
I define the photobook as any publication with substantial photographic
content. By surveying the collections in the National Library Board (NLB),
I aim to create an evolving typology of photobooks based on our experiences
in Southeast Asia.

What counts as a Southeast Asian photobook? Does the nationality of
its author or location of its publisher define whether a photobook is
Malaysian or Thai? In most cases, people would consider a book to be
Vietnamese, if, for instance, its creator were Vietnamese. I do not disagree
with such an inclination, even though this disguises the fact that the
photobook, like photography itself, is a product that traverses national
borders. *Viet Nam in Flames*, for instance, was published around 1969
with the support of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic
of Vietnam (ARVN).16 The photographers involved were Nguyê˜n Ma·nh
Đan (b. 1925, Nam Dinh Province–d. 2019) and Major Nguyê˜n Ngo· c
Ha· nh (b. 1927, Ha Dong–d. 2017, San Jose). The English-language
version of the photobook offered an account of the Vietnam War from
the perspective of the South Vietnamese establishment in an attempt to
garner global support. Unsurprisingly, in the virtual sphere today, there
are very few passing references in the Vietnamese language concerning
this photobook.17 Perhaps to ensure its quality, Kwok Hing Printing Press
in Hong Kong was entrusted with the printing of the photobook. Before
the 1997 British handover to China, Hong Kong had been an important
printing hub for publishers around the world, especially those with an
active presence in East Asia and Southeast Asia. In short, *Viet Nam in Flames* is a hybrid product informed by Hong Kong print technology and
a presumed target audience mainly located outside of Vietnam.

By extension, I wish to suggest that it is also possible to consider a
photobook to be Laotian, for instance, if the subject matter is deemed to
be Lao. The main intent is to temper the authority of the auteur, allowing
those who appear in the photobook their inalienable rights as collaborators
to claim (or reject) the publication. Naturally, instead of considering every
tatty book published about Laos as a Lao photobook, it would only be
productive to re-contextualise publications by photographers from elsewhere
who have developed a longstanding and committed relationship with their
sitters. By identifying a photobook through the claims of its sitters, we
also allow them conversely to reject association with all the problematic
publications in circulation.

Finally, it is worth remembering that Southeast Asia is not a regional
framing that has come from within. The geographical terms of “Nanyang”
in Chinese, “Nampo” in Japanese or “Nusantara” in Malay all predate
“Southeast Asia”. The latter started creeping into popular use following the
establishment of the Southeast Asia Command, an Allied force set up during
World War II to “liberate” the region. After the war, driven by the U.S.’ desire to dominate the entire region between India and China, Southeast
Asia became a region of strategic importance and an area of scholarship.18
Since then, the idea of Southeast Asia has gained limited traction from
within. While it is beyond the scope of this paper to further unpack the
imaginary of Southeast Asia, we should, at the very least, take it as an
evolving geographical framing that may or may not include places such as
Timor-Leste, Papua New Guinea, Sri Lanka, Hong Kong or even Christmas
Island. This is not a call to increase the clout of Southeast Asia in order to
redress the balance of power in Asia. Instead, this ever-morphing sense of
the region serves to remind us of the problematic origins of Southeast Asia,
while marking a productive space within to do inter-referencing work;19
in full recognition that we share enough similarities and differences in our
cultural and political experiences to make critical comparisons worthwhile.
This should prevent us from glossing over the imprint of Hong Kong or
China, for instance, in our photobook experiences across Southeast Asia.

#### **Locating Photobooks in NLB’s Collections**
Photobooks have been produced since the inception of photography. Early
examples include Anna Atkins’ *Photographs of British Algae: Cyanotype
Impressions* (1843–53) and William Henry Fox Talbot’s *The Pencil of Nature*
(1844–46). In contrast, the current valorisation of the photobook form has
been cultivated only since 2004. If we search the NLB catalogue using the
keyword “photobook”, the results will be extremely limited. Previously,
when a photobook was added to the NLB catalogue, the term “photobook”
was not used to tag the entry’s subject field. The common term used then
was “pictorial works”. The content is sometimes indicated, with the creation
of subject tags such as “Vietnam – Pictorial works” or “Cats – Pictorial
works”. However, the subject tags of “pictorial works” and “photobook”
do not always refer to the same kind of object, as the former can denote,
for instance, a book of illustrations. For the small number of publications
tagged as “photobook”, almost all of them were published during and after
2007. An alternative is to look at the “physical description” field of each title
in the NLB catalogue to ascertain if the publication contains illustrations or plates. Of course, this is not a sure-fire way of locating photobooks within
NLB’s collections.

In May 2018, I met a photobook enthusiast from England who had
recently relocated to Singapore. To acquaint himself with photobooks
produced in Southeast Asia, he visited the reference section of the National
Library at Victoria Street. Books on photography are typically found in
the Singapore &amp; Southeast Asia Collection, segregated from similar titles
published elsewhere in the world. In the reference section, he noticed that
photo-related publications from Southeast Asia, including photobooks,
filled only slightly more than a shelf. As a region peripheral to the Euro-
American centres of art, this was perhaps unsurprising to him, even though
he remained unconvinced that the region had produced so few photobooks.
In truth, his way of locating Southeast Asian photobooks in the National
Library is common, even for Singaporeans who assume that Singapore has
only ever published English books throughout its history. There are other
Southeast Asian photobooks produced in other languages, which can be
found in the library’s Malay and Chinese collections.

In fact, if we return to the definition of the photobook that I proposed
earlier, then photobooks can be found across the different collections within
NLB. Hence, in order to generate a typology of photobooks in Southeast
Asia, it is important to physically flip through a publication to see if its
photographic content forms a substantial component. Although it will take
months or years to do so, this is technically possible for publications that
can be physically accessed in the National Library’s reference section and
the borrowing collections in libraries across the country. However, there
are many publications that are not accessible on-site at the libraries, such as
the Reference Used (RU) and PublicationSG (PubSG) collections. While
the Rare Collection holds titles published before 1945, which fall beyond
the scope of my research, the Reference Closed (RCLOS), RU and PubSG
collections likely hold many publications that would fit my definition of the
photobook. RCLOS titles can be accessed on-site at the National Library,
but RU and PubSG collections are located off-site, complicating the
research process, as they need to be requested specifically by title instead of
browsing at the shelves.

On a practical level, it is impossible to flip through most of the titles within
the NLB collections. This is testament to the massive collection that NLB
has amassed over the years. Thus, one of the key challenges has been to make
an intelligent guess based on the information available in each catalogue entry, so that the process of requesting for a potential photobook from the
RCLOS, RU and PubSG collections would at least yield the right type of
publication, while recognising the risk of missing out a peculiar publication
that might complicate the typology that I wish to produce here. In short,
the typology that I intend to map can only be evolving.

#### **Translating the Photobook: Terminologies**
Photographic publications have been produced by practitioners from the
region long before the current craze in photobooks. As this craze trickles back
to parts of Asia, the term “photobook”, in some cases, has had to be translated
or re-adapted for localised usage. In Vietnam, for instance, *sách anh*, which
literally means “photobook”, is commonly used.20 Similarly, in Myanmar,
“photobook” is translated as *dat-pone sar-oak*.21 Sometimes, even a fairly
straightforward translation of the term “photobook” might bring about a
sense of consternation. For example, photo curator Ahmad Salman (b. 1970,
Semarang) insists that the accurate translation of “photobook” into Bahasa
Indonesia should be *buku foto* rather than* buku fotografi* because the latter can
be taken to mean a book about photography. *Buku foto*, on the other hand,
should be a publication that uses photography to deliver its content. Ahmad
sounds pedantic only because he feels that Indonesians have historically been
far too lax in using translated words and ideas.22

Meanwhile, there are many pre-existing terms in Southeast Asia, which
precede the current photobook hype, some of which remain relevant
today. In Mandarin, for instance, the formal term for a book, *tushu* [图
书], comprises the characters for “picture” and “book”, which already
conveys the idea of a picture or an illustrated book. According to China
photo historian Gu Zheng, in the present context “*tushu* has at least three
denotations – a book of text, of images, or both – whereas an alternate
term, *huace* [画册], refers more narrowly to a picture album composed of ink
paintings, drawings, or other illustrations”.23

In other words, the terms *tushu* and *huace* already embody the myriad of
possibilities that such a publication may offer, which is not necessarily
conveyed through the somewhat prosaic nomenclature of the photobook.
This quick consideration of the Mandarin term for the photobook is
relevant for Southeast Asia, as many of the early photobooks published
in the region since 1945 had been produced by Mandarin-speaking
practitioners (or made for Chinese readers). The term *huace* is used to refer
to some of these publications, such as *The People and the Country* (《人民与
国家》). This is a modest, saddle-stitched photobook produced by the
Tanjong Pagar Branch of the People’s Action Party (PAP) in 1972, which
visualises the evolution of the party branch as the national history of
Singapore.24 Another common term in Chinese is *tekan* [特刊], or “special
issue”. While most people associate *kan* with the term “periodical”, it can
also mean “publication”. In Southeast Asia, news companies, Chinese
schools and political parties, among others, have published numerous
*tekan*, some of which are sumptuously illustrated with photographs,
commemorating milestone events.

In the Thai language, *nangsue phapthai* [หนังสือ ภาพถ่าย] is a somewhat
literal translation of the term “photobook”.25 It is a relatively new term that
can already be found in the Thai dictionary.26 *Phapthai* and *nangsue* refer
to “photographs” and “book” respectively. On the other hand, a term like
*samut phap* [สมุดภาพ] was already in use during the reign of Rama V
(r. 1868–1910). *Samut* means “book” while *phap* refers, more broadly, to
“illustrations”. In a way, *phap* is similar to the Chinese term *tu* [图]. In other
words, *samut phap* can be used to refer to a book of drawings, paintings or
photographs. Other terms in use since the reign of Rama V include อัลบ้มั
[pronounced as *album*] and *pramuan phap* [ประมวลภาพ]. In the 1970s, for
instance, photobooks published to record the popular political movements
of 1973 and 1976 were known as *pramuan phap*.27 *Pramuan* translates to
“collection” and conveys a sense of archival in terms of putting together materials from different sources.28 These terms have since lapsed from
popular usage.

This quick survey of terminologies referring to the photobook points to
the longstanding practice of producing such publications in Southeast
Asia. Despite the current interest in photobooks, its transfer from the
metropole to Southeast Asia has been far from uneventful. In fact, without
the active intervention of local practitioners trying to translate and make
sense of the term “photobook” and the practice of photobook-making,
it would have hardly mattered, here in Southeast Asia, what Parr and
Badger have been trying to advocate. In this regard, the unevenness in the
appreciation and making of photobooks across different parts of the region
validates my point.
