#### **Episode summary** ####
In this episode, we make an unusual version of nasi lemak using a recipe from 1953. The recipe comes from a cookbook by Siti Radhiah, an early female Malay cookbook author. Is it really *nasi lemak* if it doesn’t use pandan? Join librarian and food researcher Toffa Abdul Wahed as we find out!

#### **Recipes**
Toffa made Siti Radhiah's recipes of *nasi lemak berkukus dengan lauk-pauknya* (steamed *nasi lemak* and its accompaniments), which were originally published in Jawi, in her third cookbook in 1953. Malay publications were predominantly published in Jawi until the late 1950s. In 1961, Siti Radhiah's second cookbook, *Hidangan Wanita Sekarang*, was published in roman Malay to reach a wider audience. 

True to Siti Radhiah's spirit of spreading knowledge, Toffa has translated the recipes into English. Recipes of that time tend to be less detailed, and Toffa has added her notes below.

<div style="background-color: white;">Recipe of <i>nasi lemak berkukus</i> or steamed nasi lemak, from Siti Radhiah, <i>Memilih Selera</i> [Choosing tastes] (Singapore: Harmy, 1953).</div>

<b>*Nasi lemak berkukus*</b>
<br>2 *kati* (~1210 g) Thai rice
<br>2 coconuts
<br>salt *(Toffa's recommendation: 3 tspn. salt)*

<u>Siti Radhiah's instructions</u>
<br>Cook rice with thin coconut milk in a steamer. Then remove it and pour in salted thick coconut milk and stir. Steam again until cooked. If you like it fragrant, add a few bay leaves or lemongrass.
 
Its accompaniments are thinly sliced cucumber, fried anchovies, and chicken eggs or duck eggs made into omelette. *Kacang putih* is soaked first and then fried. Slice red onions and chillies thinly, and fry them. *Nasi lemak* can also go with *opor ayam* (chicken cooked in coconut milk) and *sambal goreng*.

<u>Toffa's notes </u>
<br>Extracting the coconut milk 
1. Massage the grated coconut with water before squeezing. You can use a coconut bag or with your hands over a strainer/sift.
2. First extraction (thick milk): add 300 ml of warm water to the grated coconut.
<br>The extraction will yield  more than 300ml, as the coconut already has liquid in it. After squeezing , set aside 150 ml for the *nasi lemak*. The rest will go into the <i>opor ayam</i>.
2. Second extraction (thin milk): add 300 ml of warm water to the grated coconut.
<br>Set aside 150 ml for the *nasi lemak*. The rest will go into the <i>opor ayam</i>.
3.Third extraction (thin milk): add 300 ml of warm water to the grated coconut.
<br>The extraction is for the *nasi lemak*.
4. Do not discard the coconut yet. You might need more coconut milk later.
 
<br>Making <i>nasi lemak berkukus</i>
1. Heat the steamer.
2. Place the rice into the steaming tray/container.
3. Add thin coconut milk from the second and third squeezes.
4. Add bay leaves, pandan or lemongrass. Remove a bit of the stalk to release aroma, so that it is better infused with the rice. Use 2 bay leaves for 300g of rice in the video. 
5. Steam for 15 minutes.
6. After 15 minutes, if there is still a lot of coconut milk, stir the rice mixture and steam for another 15 minutes.
7. When most of the coconut milk has been absorbed, gently stir the rice and add the thick coconut milk (150 ml). Salt the coconut milk. Steam for another 15 minutes.
8. At each step, taste the rice to check for doneness, and gently stir the rice, so that it cooks evenly.
9. If the rice is not completely cooked, stir and continue steaming for another 10 minutes.
10. When the rice is cooked, turn off the heat and allow the rice to rest in the steamer for at least 10 minutes. Then fluff the rice with a fork or spoon. Caution: Steam is very hot! Do not get burned by it. Use a long ladle to stir your rice or wear a mitten.

<b>*Opor ayam*</b>
<br>1 chicken
<br>½ tbsp. coriander seeds
<br>½ tsp. white pepper
<br>a pinch of salt
<br>3 cloves garlic
<br>10 red onions
<br>10 candlenuts
<br>a thumb-sized piece of ginger
<br>a bit of galangal
<br>1 coconut
<br>3 bay leaves
<br>some lemongrass

<u>Siti Radhiah's instructions</u>
<br> Ground coriander seeds, salt and white pepper together. Then add garlic, candlenuts, galangal, ginger and red onions. Grind them until fine. Sauté all of the spices with a bit of coconut oil. Then add bay leaves, lemongrass and chicken that has been cleaned and chopped up, and stir. When most of the liquid has dried up, add coconut milk. When the gravy is thick and the chicken is tender, remove from heat.

<u>Toffa's notes </u>
<br>The *opor ayam* can be cooked  while the rice is being steamed.

1. Pound, grind or blend coriander seeds and white peppercorns. Then add garlic, candlenuts, galangal, ginger and shallots. If you use a blender, use coriander powder and white pepper powder instead of the seeds and corns, as they might be too small for the blender blades. Pound, grind or blend until you get a fine paste.
5. Heat the coconut oil in a pot at low-medium heat. Do not use high heat, as coconut oil has a low smoking point.
6. Add the <i>rempah</i> or spice paste. Sauté until it becomes fragrant and the paste is no longer raw. Do not burn or overcook it. 
7. Add bay leaves and lemongrass. Break the lemongrass with the pestle or a hard object before adding it in.
8. Add the chicken and fry it for a while in the spices.
9.  Add the thick and thin coconut milk that has been set aside for the <i>opor ayam</i>.
10. Salt to taste.
11. Cover the pot. Stir occasionally and continue cooking at low-medium heat.
12. Once the chicken is cooked, remove the lid and continue cooking to reduce and thicken the gravy.
13. You’re done! The thickness of the sauce is up to your own liking. Salt to taste.

<b>*Sambal goreng*</b> 
<br>½ *kati* (~303 g) meat 
<br>4 tbsp. sliced red onions
<br>4 slices ginger
<br>a bit of sliced lemongrass
<br>4 cloves garlic, sliced
<br>½ tsp. shrimp paste
<br>a bit of granulated sugar
<br>15 red chillies, thinly sliced (dried chillies can also be used)
<br>4 tofu, sliced
<br>salt 
<br>a bit of tamarind

<u>Siti Radhiah's instructions</u>
<br>
Clean the meat well, cut it into small pieces, and fry them. Sauté red onions, garlic, ginger and lemongrass in cooking oil. Then add the thinly sliced dried chillies and stir. Add the fried meat and cut tofu, followed by shrimp paste, and a bit of salt, sugar and tamarind juice. If you like, add some *pati santan* (undiluted coconut milk). Stir until dry, and remove from heat. *Sambal goreng* is also made with tempeh and thinly sliced long beans.

<u>Toffa's notes </u>
1. Fry the beef and remove from pan. (Maybe  use a non-stick pan.)
2. Fry the tofu and remove from pan.
3. Remove some  oil from the pan. Leave enough oil to cook the rest of the dish and assemble all the ingredients.
4. Fry shallots, garlic, ginger and lemongrass until fragrant, the shallots become cooked or turn translucent, and the garlic slightly golden.
5. Add the red chillies and fry briefly until they wilt or slightly soften.
6. Add the beef and tofu.
7. In a small bowl, add belacan and tamarind paste. Add water to dissolve the belacan and mix in the tamarind paste.
8. Pour mixture into the pan. Ensure enough liquid to nicely coat the beef and tofu. This allows for the belacan and tamarind mixture to be absorbed by the beef and tofu. If it is too dry, it will be harder for the beef and tofu to absorb the seasoning. Extra water can always be cooked down.
9. Add salt and sugar to taste while there is still liquid in the pan. Note: Not too much salt since the belacan is already salty.
10. The final dish should have little to no gravy.
