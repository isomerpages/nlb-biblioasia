The first-ever English and Malay dictionary was written by an unlikely swashbuckling British trader by the name of Thomas Bowrey.1 More interestingly, it was published in 1701, more than a century before Stamford Raffles even set foot in Singapore. 

The hefty 594-page bi-directional dictionary – in English-Malay and Malay-English – includes 468 pages of words and definitions, a section on Malay rules of grammar as well as a compilation of miscellaneous phrases, sentences, dialogues and specimen letters. 

Both English and Malay words are listed in alphabetical order, a convention that is still used today. The dictionary also contains a double-page map titled “A Map of the Countrys wherein the Malayo Language is Spoken”, illustrating the geographical reach of the language in the 17th century. 

Bowrey’s dictionary was a pioneering tool in the study of the Malay language. Not only was it the first dictionary of English and Malay published, it was also the first to use Roman letters instead of Jawi.2 This dictionary stood out as the only work of its kind until 1801, when James Howison published *A Dictionary of the Malay Tongue as Spoken in the Peninsular of Malacca, the Islands of Sumatra, Jawa, Borneo, Pulau Pinang etc. in Two Parts, English and Malay, and Malay 
and English*.3

Although the Dutch – who had a longer 
presence in the Malay Archipelago – had earlier published works on the Malay language 
that had been translated in the 17th century 
into English,4
 these were not dictionaries. 
Bowrey’s work therefore bears the distinction of being the “first original independent 
publication by an English scholar in the 
Malay field”.5
Credit should be given to Bowrey for 
reproducing his practical experience with 
spoken Malay into a dictionary despite the 
relatively short intervals of time he spent in 
the Malay-speaking regions.6
 Since Bowrey 
was likely not familiar with the written form, 
the Malay taught to him was not literary 
but idiomatic. The entries in his dictionary 
are therefore representative of the type of 
Malay used in conversations between British traders and local Malays at the time.7
To ensure the Malay words are pronounced 
correctly, Bowrey inserted accent marks 
above the vowels.8
