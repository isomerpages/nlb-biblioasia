#### Neo Tiew: The Man Who Built Lim Chu Kang

Neo Tiew Estate is a small housing estate in Lim Chu Kang.[^1] It consists of three low-rise blocks of vacant flats, a disused market and food centre, and an abandoned children’s playground. The residents were resettled in the late 1990s and early 2000s and the estate is now used for training by the Singapore Armed Forces.

Neo Tiew Estate, and the nearby Neo Tiew Road, Neo Tiew Crescent and Neo Tiew Lanes 1, 2 and 3 are named after a remarkable man by the name of Neo Tiew (梁宙; 1884–1975).[^2] Neo played an instrumental role in the development of Lim Chu Kang. It is thanks to his energy and vision that the area was cleared and became used as farmland. While agriculture is no longer a large part of Singapore’s economy today, the Lim Chu Kang area has an important role to play in the country’s plans to become more self-sufficient in food. A century after Neo first began clearing the area, the impact of his work is still being felt.

#### **A Meeting of Minds**

It was 1914 and businessman Alexander W. Cashin (1876–1947) owned 800 acres of land in Lim Chu Kang that he wanted to develop.[^3] He needed someone honest and trustworthy, and with experience in land clearance and plantation management. He found that man in the person of Neo Tiew.[^4]

Born in 1884 in Nan’an county in Fujian province, China, Neo left his impoverished hometown in 1897 at the age of 13 in search of a better life in Singapore. He worked in various odd jobs after he arrived and eventually ended up managing a rubber plantation in Selangor until 1912.

That was also the year when he took over his uncle’s brick-making business, Yuanshengfa, which was located on Holland Road. Through this business, Neo met Cashin, who was one of the customers Neo supplied bricks to. Cashin found Neo to be honest, hardworking and capable, and approached him to clear his land in Lim Chu Kang.[^5] In 1914, Neo took up Cashin’s offer and this decision put Neo on the path to reshaping the area. 

#### **Opening Lim Chu Kang**

Neo approached the task like a military operation. Deploying 800 men to clear 800 acres of land was not simple. Getting to Lim Chu Kang, in the absence of roads from the town (and with only a sparse network of jungle tracks in the area itself), was a tedious undertaking that involved sailing from Telok Ayer to the Strait of Johor.[^6]

With an advance party of eight men, Neo brought along boatloads of building materials. About 1.5 kilometres from their landing point, the team began clearing the secondary jungle and putting up huts, while spending their nights onboard their boats. After completing their temporary accommodation, Neo brought in the next wave of 40 men to augment his workforce. Over time, as the work advanced steadily inland, their beachhead became Neo’s command centre.

It took five years for the men to clear the land and reach the upper tributaries of Kranji River where Neo decided to build a jetty to take advantage of the river as a communications artery. They also planted large numbers of coconut trees, pineapple plants and later, rubber trees. (Neo’s methodical and systematic land clearance drew the attention of businessman Mirza Mohamed Ali Namazie, who approached Neo to clear 900 acres of his land in the area as well.[^7])

#### **Building Lim Chu Kang**

This was when Neo’s business took off. Together with Cashin’s gift of 60 acres of land, Neo expanded his own land to 200 acres, centred around Nam Hoe Village and the jetty he built. (The village was named after its most prominent landmark, the Nam Hoe provision shop that Neo had opened.[^8])

The Kranji River was Nam Hoe Village’s only connection to the outside world. To get to Woodlands Road, which was the most direct route to the town, one would first have to traverse by boat down the river and disembark at Jalan Nam Huat. This inaccessibility also cut the area off from the growing traffic that came when the Causeway opened in 1923.[^9]

Neo lobbied the colonial government to build a road to connect the Lim Chu Kang area to the rest of the island.[^10] The government insisted on a co-payment model and left Neo to canvass and raise funds for this project. In total, more than $30,000 was raised for the 8-kilometre-long road.

On 4 October 1930, the Public Works Department opened a tender for the construction of “earthwork formation for new road at Lim Chu Kang”.[^11] By 1932, Lim Chu Kang Road was “open to within 1½ miles of the Johore Straits”.[^12]

The new road provided the impetus for the founding of another village, Thong Hoe, which was named after yet another provision shop owned by Neo.[^13]

Lim Chin Sei, who used to be a farmer in Lim Chu Kang, recalled in his oral history interview that the provision shop was the centre of village life, a meeting point and the place where Neo arbitrated and resolved disputes and quarrels. According to Lim, Neo loved to regale his audience with stories – there were no airs about him despite his wealth – and he frequently attended weddings and funerals, keeping his pulse on things. When it came to crime though, Neo was firm and no-nonsense, and the village thugs were afraid of him.[^14]

Seeing that Lim Chu Kang needed a proper school, Neo donated five acres of land and a sum of money to set up Kay Wah School (present-day Qihua Primary School) in 1938. Subsequently, Kay Wah School opened branches in Nam Hoe Village and the nearby Ama Keng Village (named after a temple
