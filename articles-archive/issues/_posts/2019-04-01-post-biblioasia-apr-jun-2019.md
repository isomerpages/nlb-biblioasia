**Stories of the Little People** <br>
Oral history is often considered as “little” – personal accounts of humble folk, as opposed to “big” or written history on serious topics. But “little” does not mean negligible or inferior, says *Cheong Suk-Wai*. [(PDF)](/files/pdf/vol-15/v15-issue1_Little.pdf)
