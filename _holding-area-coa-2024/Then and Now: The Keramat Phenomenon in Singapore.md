Singapore once abounded with *keramat* that ranged from sturdy structures, such as the Keramat Iskandar Shah* at Fort Canning, to simple roadside shrines, such as the vanished Orang Halus* *keramat* at the Havelock Road Police Station.  Sadly, most of these *keramat* were demolished over the past half century to make way for development. The most recent of these demolitions, Keramat Siti Mariam in Kallang*, was followed by an exhibition at the National University of Singapore’s museum in 2011, but most of the demolitions were carried out without much notice.

*Keramat* represent physical markers of Singapore’s history as a maritime trading centre, yet they are also focal points for the communities in which they stood, offering a sanctified space where people could seek solace or ask for dispensation or intervention in personal problems. Maintained by self-appointed caretakers, each *keramat* has folklore that interweaves historical facts with a syncretic spirituality mirroring the sensibilities of the community.

This paper will offer a brief of analysis of the various types of keramat that were once found across Singapore, including *keramat hidup* or living *keramat*, *datuk keramat*, grave-shrines or shrines that resemble graves, and authentic graves. It concludes by examining how, for instance as vernacular culture, *keramat* often have fraught relationships with authority, both religious and secular.        

#### **What’s a Keramat?**
*Keramat* are sacred objects that possess a special energy known as *semangat*. These may be natural objects like trees, rocks, termite mounds, whirlpools, waterfalls; living animals; living people; graves of *wali* or venerated persons; old graves of unknown origin; spirits of animals or holy men; or a combination thereof. 

Each *kerama*t is unique, yet different ethnic groups may have varying perspectives on a single *kerama*t. It was common for a *keramat* to have multiple identities: names, ages, origins, and even genders could change over time. 

However, some *keramat* have maintained relatively stable identities over the decades. It is perhaps not a coincidence that most of these tend to be the *keramat* that still exist, for instance, Habib Nuh*, Iskandar Shah, Radin Mas* and Tok Lasam*.

While the *keramat* tradition is rooted in the Islamic culture of the region, the relationship between *keramat* and Islam is complex. Some modern Muslims are regular devotees at *keramat*, while others consider them to be idolatrous. The belief of most Muslims I spoke with falls somewhere between these two polarities. 

In the simplest sense, *keramat* are grounded in a localised version of Islam that incorporates Sufi practices from the Hadhramout (a region in Yemen) filtered through South Asia. Some *keramat* demonstrate a syncretic blend of Taoist, Hindu and local animistic practices. There is also a tradition of Baba Chinese *keramat* that invoke spirits with Muslim/Malay names and iconography.

Some *keramat* are known for special powers such as helping to conceive children or granting winning lottery numbers, and specific offerings, like tying stones to nearby trees or railings, are made at these shrines.
