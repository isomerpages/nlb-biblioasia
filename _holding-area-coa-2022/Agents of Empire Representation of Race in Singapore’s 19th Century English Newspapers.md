#### **Introduction**

Singapore’s first newspaper, the  <i> Singapore Chronicle </i> , was published a mere five years after Stamford Raffles stepped ashore in 1819.1 Soon, the printed word took such a hold of the public mind that busy merchants in Commercial Square (now Raffles Place) were spending a half hour daily discussing the news, including commodity prices and the arrival and departure of cargo-laden ships.2

A plethora of newspapers were launched during the 19th century, though most sank rather quickly. Some, like the <i>Singapore Free Press</i>, survived well into the 20th century, while the <i>Straits Times</i> is in circulation to this day. Virtually all newspapers then perpetuated ideas of race, civilisation, progress and development that subordinated the native and immigrant populations to white colonisers. This essay will show how they did so, by drawing examples from local English-language newspapers across a quarter of a century – from 1875, when Singapore was still a young Crown Colony following its administrative reconstitution into the Straits Settlements, to
the close of the century. The newspapers propped up the imperial edifice,
alongside weapons, books, art and other modes of knowledge production
that have been so extensively studied by scholars of postcolonialism.


#### **The Sociopolitical Context – Global and Local**
By the mid-19th century, the tentacles of British imperialism had reached
into the farthest expanses of Asia and Africa through coercion, deception
and collaboration with local elites. The brutal suppression of the 1857 revolt
in India had been followed by the passing of power into the hands of the
Crown under Queen Victoria. The 258-year-old East India Company was
out, and the Age of Empire officially dawned. This puzzled the British. How
could an island of 17 million establish sovereignty over territories thousands
of miles away and many times greater in size and population? The English
historian John Robert Seeley captured this sense of disbelief, writing in 1883:
“We seem, as it were, to have conquered and peopled half the world in a fit
of absence of mind.”3
There was no dearth of (pseudo) scientific theories to explain the
impossible. Most of these coalesced under social Darwinism. Seizing upon
Darwin’s 1838 theory of biological evolution, academics like Herbert Spencer
quickly concocted its social counterpart, i.e., survival among individuals
competing for limited resources. And given that Europeans in general and
the English in particular were winning the competition, the academics
concluded that the European civilisation was the apex of human evolution,
with others – Hindu, Islamic, Chinese, African, Malay – competing for a
distant second place.4

Singapore had its fair share of colonial administrators who subscribed
to these ideas. Raffles himself, until so recently considered a progressive
administrator, believed in a metaphorical racial ladder, the highest rungs of
which were occupied by Europeans, followed by those natives who adopted
Western modes of behaviour, lifestyle and clothing.5

Four decades after leaving Singapore, its second Resident, the inveterate
traveller and writer John Crawfurd, observed:

     In understanding, in judgment, in taste, in invention, in reach

     of imagination, in enterprise, in perseverance, and in the

     moral sense, the European, placed under equally favourable

     conditions, is greatly superior to the Asiatic.6

Sir Frederick Weld, Governor of the Straits Settlements (1880–87),
echoed similar sentiments: “I think that capacity for governing is a
characteristic of our race, and it is wonderful to see in a country like the
Straits.”7 The Chinese, in Weld’s estimation, depended on the British to look
after them much as “a groom looks after a horse”, and the Malays were in
awe of British probity even in the face of the most alluring 
temptations.8

In the second half of the 19th century, both the opening of the Suez
Canal and the long-distance steamship’s increasing dominance of the ocean
enabled “scientific” theories concocted in London to quickly make their way
to the empire’s outposts, while observations made in far-flung places like
Malaya travelled swiftly to the metropole. This created a circle of knowledge
that endlessly reproduced the same ideas, tropes and stereotypes until they
took on the veneer of truth.

One of the more obvious ways in which newspapers perpetuated
racial hierarchies was by giving voice to new-fangled theories and books.
In December 1853, for example, the <i>Singapore Free Press and Mercantile
Advertiser</i> published a report on a phrenology lecture given by a Mr Sargent
to a “numerous audience”; decades later, the <i>Mid-Day Herald</i> excitedly
announced the arrival of Mrs Josepha North, a sculptor turned renowned
phrenologist, on the island’s shores.9 Phrenology, a now discredited science, claimed a relationship between various races’ skull shapes and intelligence,
and the race it deemed the most intelligent was obvious.

Occasionally, the  <i> Free Press </i>  printed chapters from new books in
serialised form. One chapter titled “The Chinese Towkay” from a book
called  <i> People in a Native State </i> , published on 2 December 1893, is illustrative:

     Many Towkays I know are perfectly at home with a knife and

     fork, indeed some of them give capital dinners. As they have

     educated themselves so far towards civilized society, it is to be

     hoped that they will continue to progress and thereby in time

     cultivate a correct palate for champagne and other wines, so

     that “Comet” and other wonderful but undrinkable beverages

     may no longer adorn (?) their hospitable tables.10

But the newspapers’ role extended beyond mere conduits of information;
they must be situated within a suitable theoretical framework.

#### **Why Newspapers? “Knowing” the Native and “Creating” the Self**
In the late 19th century, the national newspaper, along with the telegraph,
was critical to empire and empire-building (and eventually, to those who
opposed empire). Various British governments sought to control information
flow, shape the interpretation of events and form “symbiotic” relationships
with newswires like Reuters for their own political ends.11

Papers in imperial outposts like the Straits Settlements with their
insignificant English-reading population could not bring down governments
in Britain, but they could certainly have an impact on local policy and affect
public estimation of colonial officials on the island. By controlling the flow
of information and deciding what to publish and omit, newspapers and their
owners became arbiters of public opinion, the gatekeepers who decided what
would be discussed in Commercial Square that afternoon or at the Padang
that evening. Far from being ephemera, then, newspapers were of a piece
with other modes of knowledge production on which the colonial project
was predicated.

Reporting on daily humdrum events and highlighting the minutiae of
19th-century Singapore’s daily life allowed newspapers and their subscribers
to “know” the native Other (“native” is used here to denote all non-
European races in Singapore) as much as the more commonly analysed
forms of media, including but not limited to books, travelogues, pamphlets,
art, official censuses and catalogues. While these media offered a more
big-picture view of native lives and were usually produced for consumption
in imperial metropoles, newspapers were printed locally and carried mostly
local news for the benefit of the local ruling race, or as was the case with
one newspaper that will be analysed later, for the benefit of a race aspiring to
join the rulers on their pedestal.

In critiquing colonial knowledge structures, Edward Said defined
Orientalism as “a library or archive of information commonly and, in some
of its aspects, unanimously held. What bound the archive together was a
family of ideas and a unifying set of values proven in various ways to be
effective”.12 English newspapers in 19th-century Singapore belonged to
this archive.

An important element in this family of ideas was the colonial power’s
imagination of itself. The British saw themselves as superior not just
economically and militarily but also politically and ethically – a unique
people destined to bring progress to the non-white world.13 Superiority was
possible only by being separate, by creating an identity distinct from that of
the natives. When the British first landed on Indian shores as mere traders,
for example, they carved out residential enclaves away from the natives.14
At home, in offices or out hunting in the field, they maintained a studied
aloofness from local customs, traditions and populations. This tendency
intensified when they became the dominant political and military force
in South and Southeast Asia. By 1867, expression of this separateness had
become the norm.

“Don’t admit that you’re living in an Oriental country, live nearly as
possible as you would in Europe,” was Roland Braddell’s advice to his countrymen in Singapore.15 Broadsheets helped in this endeavour by
carrying in-depth reports on quintessentially English sports like cricket
and drag hunting and by publishing wistful memories of Christmas “back
home”, among other things.16 In fact, in elucidating its aims and objectives,
the first-ever issue of the Straits Times indicated a desire to engender British
nationalism among the Straits Englishmen who found themselves so far
away from home.17

Such reporting created a variation of Benedict Anderson’s concept of the
nation as an “imagined community” – an imagined <i>imperial</i> community
that connected one Englishman to another, separate from the traditions
of the place that they physically inhabited and superior to the races of
the region.18 News from London, commodity prices, ship arrivals and
departures, colonial appointments, births and deaths all connected the
empire’s frontiers to its hub. The English were <i>in</i> Singapore, but often
not <i>of</i> it.

English newspapers in the 19th century can thus be analysed under
the rich theoretical tradition of postcolonial studies. It is to three such
newspapers that were published in Singapore that we turn next. The
sections below will examine how the <i>Straits Times</i> (ST) depicted native
populations in the sports arena from 1875 to 1899, how the <i>Straits Eurasian
Advocate</i> (SEA) emphasised Eurasian identity and represented Indian and
Chinese immigrants in 1888, and how the <i>Straits Observer</i> (SO) depicted the
Malays during a short-lived but acute crisis in Perak in 1876. These papers
were accessed via NewspaperSG, the newspaper archive of Singapore’s
National Library.19

#### **How They Make Us Laugh**

     In the boxing match, a Chinaman while in the pursuit of

     defending himself from his antagonist, dropped his nether

     garment; his hands being bound with his gloves, was at a loss

     to brush himself up, which caused not a little laughter and

     merriment.20

The festive season in Singapore – a fortnight that included Christmas
and the New Year – usually ended with a full day of sporting activities at
the Padang on the first or second day of the year. By all accounts it was a
joyous, raucous occasion with thousands lining the carriage track around
the ground; men, women and children of all races dressed in their finery to
witness the sporting prowess of the best that the island had to offer. It was
the one day when the ruling and the ruled occupied the same public space,
and enjoyed the same entertainment, albeit with the natives segregated from
the Europeans. In a rare instance when the two were forced to mingle, the
ST was quick to point out that “it would be better if on a future occasion
the arrangements for the comfort of Europeans were amplified. There were
many Europeans who were standing all afternoon among the natives, and
that is not altogether pleasant”.21

Since the English could not afford to be seen being beaten by the locals,
the competition was segregated too. What was more, the sports themselves differed. Europeans participated in “foot races and athletic exercises; and in
the sack race, three legged race, boxing match, and race with water buckets
poised on the head”.22 The natives walked a greasy tongkang boom to pluck
a twig or a flag from the end, vied to eat the most number of hard biscuits
and dunked their heads into buckets of treacle in search of a half-dollar
coin.23 By the close of the century, “rikisha pulling” – in which Chinese and
Indians raced rickshaws carrying a European passenger over a distance of
220 yards – had been introduced to the programme.

Of the biscuit-eating, the ST intoned thus:

     Most of the eaters evidently entered for the sake of the feed,

     as their leisurely mastication did not suggest that they were in

     for a prize. Two or three, however, made <i>little beasts</i> [emphasis

     added] of themselves and were accordingly awarded $2.25

     between them.24

Treacle-dipping did not escape the paper’s lampooning either:

     Imagine, good folks at home, enthusiasts for the small sum

     of fifty cents plunging their heads into a tub of golden syrup

     – or its prototype – and groping about for the melancholy

     coin…  <i> they ran amok </i> , afterwards, all dripping and half

     blind with treacle, and the  <i> wild stampede of the Asiatics </i>  in

     their Sunday clothes, as each competitor made a beeline for

     the sea, was probably  <i> the most comical part of the business </i> 

     [emphases added].25
	
Such reportage reduced the natives to caricature, clowns in a
circus conducted by English ringmasters. In Singapore, as elsewhere,
infantilisation of the colonised populations was key to perpetuating the
notion of English superiority.26 One newspaper gleefully narrated events from Bangalore, India, where “rather a novel mode of amusement has been
introduced by the officers of the 21st Hussars”.27 The soldiers pitted their
Indian servants – syces (horse carers) against cooks – in a cricket match.
Not being familiar with the sport, the servants’ clumsy attempts at playing
it caused much merriment among their masters, “more especially at the
fielding in which not a few in their eagerness to join in a leather hunt often
came into collision and cannoned against each other rather roughly”.28
	
Overlordship could be justified if one bought into the idea that the
wild Asiatic races – uncultured children masquerading as adults – needed a
guiding hand, a paterfamilias, to look after their well-being. Depictions of
natives as clumsy cartoon figures helped build that image.

Often, what was left out was almost as significant as what was reported.
For instance, papers usually listed all the winners of European sports while
making no mention whatsoever of those from local sports. The natives were
just that – “the natives” – an entertaining agglomeration, the individual
members of which did not matter.29

There is remarkable uniformity in how the New Year sports activities
were described over the years. In 1875, the ST reported that  <i> “among the
most amusing of the races </i>  was one of a hundred yards with tubs of treacle,
which placed on their heads, so besmeared the contestants with the sweet
liquid that they were glad to rid themselves by a plunge off the Government
pier”.30 A quarter-century later, in 1899, the paper was similarly tickled:
“possibly, however, the  <i> funniest thing of all </i>  [emphasis added] was the treacle
dipping competition. The spectacle presented by a number of natives
endeavouring to pick up half dollars with their teeth out of tub of treacle is
better imagined than described.”31

The images of the natives were relentlessly recycled over the years: little 
Malay ruffians always got themselves a good meal out of the biscuit-eating competition, clueless Chinamen always struggled with the science of
boxing, and the Klings were always prone to taking things easy, even
in competition.

In sharp contrast to this, European sports were accorded the respect
and gravitas in keeping with the colonial power’s opinion of itself. Once
the native games were out of the way in the morning, the Europeans took
over with fare that was generally “more attractive” than what had preceded
it. Distances jumped, heights leaped and race times were reported in
admiring terms, closely fought contests were “capital” and participants
invariably acquitted themselves creditably. In this way, the newspaper served
to degrade the native and enhance the European, further entrenching
racial differences.
