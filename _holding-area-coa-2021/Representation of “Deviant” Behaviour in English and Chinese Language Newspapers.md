Let any unprejudiced European walk through the native<br> 
towns of Java, Singapore and China and see if he can find a<br> 
single native drunk. What he will meet with are numbers of<br> 
drunken English, Scotch and Irish seamen literally rolling<br> 
in the gutters, intoxicated, not from opium but from rum<br> 
and spirits sent all the way from England for the purpose of<br> 
enabling her worthy sons to exhibit themselves to Chinese<br> 
and other nations in this disgraceful light.1
