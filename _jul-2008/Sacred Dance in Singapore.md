description: Dance is a powerful form of communication. Odissi is often
  considered the oldest form of classical dance still surviving. Originating
  more than 2,000 years ago in Indiaâ€™s Orissa state, it evolved purely as a
  devotional dance form performed daily as part of temple rituals by highly
  trained dancers called Maharis.
