Singaporeans are perennially eating or else talking about their next meal – such is their obsession with food. The city’s gastronomic scene is renowned, with *makan* (“eat” in Malay) places offering everything from hawker fare to haute cuisine. The inclusion of hawker stalls in the *Michelin Guide Singapore* (the third edition was launched recently1) is testimony of the heights that hawker fare with its humble street food origins has risen to. 

#### **Hawker Tales**

Hawker centres are quintessentially Singaporean institutions. First-time visitors – usually tourists – are often amazed at the rich and affordable array of freshly cooked food conveniently housed under one roof.

The “irony of the hawker centre” in Singapore, notes social scientist and geographer Lily Kong, is that the hawker no longer goes around selling goods.2 Singapore’s hawker culture can be traced to itinerant hawkers from the 19th to mid-20th centuries who literally moved from one place to another calling out to customers and peddling food, drinks and household wares. In order to eradicate problems arising from contamination, improper refuse disposal and traffic congestion caused by makeshift stalls, the government resettled street hawkers within purpose-built standalone hawker centres from the 1970s onwards.

Over the years, street hawker food has made its way to hawker centres, coffeeshops, food courts and even the menus of fancy restaurants.3 The iconic Satay Club at the Esplanade and Glutton’s Square on Orchard Road are long gone, but more traditional hawker centres such as Newton Food Centre, Maxwell Food Centre and Chomp Chomp Food Centre still pack in the crowds despite competition from fast food outlets, air conditioned food courts and new-fangled cafes.4

#### **Kopitiam and Coffee Socks**

The ubiquitous *kopitiam* (literally “coffeeshop”; *kopi* meaning “coffee” in Malay and *tiam* for “shop” in Hokkien) is found in almost every neighbourhood in Singapore, with many open 24/7 for people who need their coffee (or supper) fix. Coffeeshops have been around for as long as people remember them and have come to symbolise our forefathers’ entrepreneurial spirit.

The coffeeshop is patronised by Singaporeans from all walks of life. It is a place where one can enjoy good local food and catch up on gossip over a freshly brewed cup of *kopi* or *teh* (“tea”) paired with toast slathered with *kaya* (coconut jam) and half-boiled eggs drizzled with dark soy sauce.

There are no baristas at these coffeeshops, just “uncles” and “aunties” who have mastered the art of making that perfect cup of coffee. Doctor and food blogger Leslie Tay remembers the “uncle in pajama pants making kopi” and reminisces that “stepping into Heap Seng Leong [along North Bridge Road] is like stepping into a time portal”.5

Here is a sampling of publications featuring hawker stalls and coffeeshops from the National Library’s Legal Deposit Collection. 

<b>Around Lau Pa Sat: A “What’s On” Guide to Singapore’s First and Only Festival Market</b><br> (Sep/Oct 1993)
<img src="/images/Vol-14-issue-3/makan-places-and-coffee-socks/CoffeeSocks2.JPG">Opened in 1894, Lau Pa Sat (meaning “old market”) – also known as Telok Ayer Market – in the Central Business District – is known as the “grande dame of markets”. The market was converted into a hawker centre in 1972. The Sep/Oct 1993 edition of the newsletter features budget meals and recommends dishes such as <i>kueh pie tee</i>, vegetables and rice, and soup from the various stalls.

<b>Not for Sale: Singapore’s Remaining Heritage Street Food Vendors </b><br> (2013)
<img src="/images/Vol-14-issue-3/makan-places-and-coffee-socks/CoffeeSocks3.JPG">This commemorative book pays tribute to 300 hawker and street food stalls who have had a long history in Singapore. The editorial team visited various hawker centres in Singapore over a two-year period to locate, interview and document the trials and tribulations of our heritage hawkers. As highlighted in the introduction, each has a unique story to tell, with its “own set of challenges, circumstances and accomplishments”.6

<b>The Business Times & Knight Frank CEOs’ Hawker Guide </b><br> (2010)
<img src="/images/Vol-14-issue-3/makan-places-and-coffee-socks/CoffeeSocks4.JPG">Published by <i>The Business Times</i> and Knight Frank in 2010 to raise funds to preserve Singapore’s hawker heritage, this book presents the personal food stories of some of Singapore’s prominent business leaders. In all, 134 stalls in 26 local food categories are featured, ranging from <i>bak kut teh</i> and <i>nasi padang</i> to <i>roti prata</i>. Obviously, CEOs are just as comfortable eating out at hawker centres as they do at fine-dining restaurants.7

<b>I-S Magazine </b><br> (2008)
<img src="/images/Vol-14-issue-3/makan-places-and-coffee-socks/CoffeeSocks5.JPG">The writers claim that it is “no secret that food factors largely in the psyche of the average Singaporean… [and] nothing comes remotely close to the colourful experience of eating in a hawker centre… from the most sinful <i>char kway teow</i>, or <i>luak</i> (fried oyster), Hokkien noodles, chicken rice and carrot cake…”.8 They stake out four popular hawker centres – People’s Park, Maxwell, Newton and Bedok Interchange – to find out what goes on in a day in the life of the average hawker.
