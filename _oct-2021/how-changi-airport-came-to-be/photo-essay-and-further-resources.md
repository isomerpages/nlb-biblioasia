#### Learn about Changi Airport through photos. 

The Changi Airport was the largest public project in Singapore when it was completed in 1981, costing S$1.5 billion. Newspaper reports of that time were replete with figures of the costs of construction and communications equipment, dimensions of the complex and airspace, and lengths of the runways and the underground bus terminal. 

Before the airport became operational on 1 July 1981, it was opened to the public to great reception. Tours were sold out, and by mid-June the airport had received more than 250,000 visitors, about a tenth of Singapore’s population. Clearly Changi Airport has captured public imagination.[^1]

Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew was instrumental in the making of Changi Airport. In 1975, he decided to build a new airport at Changi on a site five times larger than the Paya Lebar Airport, going against consultants’ initial recommendation. The cost of relocation to Changi excluded the sunk cost of $800 million invested in the Paya Lebar airport.[^2]
