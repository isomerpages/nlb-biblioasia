This documentary examines the tragic life of the mysterious poet Francis P. Ng, who wrote Singapore’s first book-length poem, F.M.S.R., and then disappeared during World War II. Researcher Eriko Ogihara-Schuck recounts the almost miraculous way she was able to confirm his fate and to connect with a living relative of his – a niece. Singaporean poets Alvin Pang and Robert Yeo also weigh in on the significance of Francis P. Ng’s work. 
This moving documentary is based on two essays: “On the Trail of Francis P. Ng” (BiblioAsia, Jan-Mar 2015) and “Ties that Bind: The Story of Two Brother Poets” (BiblioAsia, Jan-Mar 2017).
