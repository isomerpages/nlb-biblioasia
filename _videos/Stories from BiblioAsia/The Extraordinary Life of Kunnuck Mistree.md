Kunnuck Mistree came to Singapore in 1825 as a mere convict. Over time, he gained his freedom, raised a family, became a “native doctor”, received a pardon and eventually died a wealthy man. As a result of painstaking original research by educator and writer Vandana Aggarwal, we now have an insight into the life of one of the earliest people from India who came to Singapore. 

This documentary is based on[ Vandana’s article](/vol-16/issue-4/jan-mar-2021/kunnuck) of the same title that was published in the January–March 2021 issue of BiblioAsia.
