#### _Hikayat Abdullah_ (_The Story of Abdullah_) by Munshi Abdullah Abdul Kadir provides glimpses of life in early Singapore. Abdullah arrived in Singapore from Melaka about four months after Stamford Raffles established a trading post on the island in February 1819.

In our last two issues, we introduced the autobiography of Munshi Abdullah Abdul Kadir which was written in Jawi between 1840 and 1843 and published in 1849. The author was the interpreter and scribe to the founder of modern Singapore, Sir Stamford Raffles.

In this issue, we continue to highlight stories from the Hikayat Abdullah (The Story of Abdullah). The Hikayat Abdullah provides glimpses of life in early Singapore. Abdullah arrived in Singapore from Malacca about four months after Singapore became a British trading port in 1819.

From Abdullah’s accounts, Singapore was certainly not a place for the faint-hearted. It was used as a port by the pirates to plunder ships and boats sailing near Singapore.

*Syahadan, adapun pada masa itu, jangankan manusia hendak lalu-lalang di laut Singapura itu, jin syaitan pun takut, sebab di situlah bilik tempat perompak tidur, atau barang di mana pun ia merompak kapal atau keci atau perahu, dibawanyalah ke Singapura. Di situlah tempat ia membahagi harta dan membunuh orangnya atau berbunuh-bunuhan sesama sendirinya, sebab merebut harta itu, adanya*.1

At that time, the sea surrounding Singapore was far from being navigated freely by men, for along the shores were the sleeping-huts of the pirates. Whenever they plundered a ship or a ketch or a cargo-boat, they brought it into Singapore to share the spoils. They also slaughtered the crew or fought to death among themselves to secure their gains.2

Lawlessness was rife in Singapore, despite the presence of the British. There were frequent incidents of houses catching fire, robberies in broad daylight, people getting stabbed, houses broken into and property stolen.3 The situation was almost out of control as the law enforcers themselves became victims.

*Bermula pada tiap-tiap hari hari waktu itu tiada berkeputusan orang mati dibunuh sepanjang jalan Kampung Gelam itu. Maka ada juga mata-mata polis menjaga sana-sini, akan tetapi berapa-berapa banyak mata-mata itu dibunuh orang sehari*.4
