_After reading the tale of Tok Sumang, let us recite Surah Al-Fatihah \[a prayer\] upon his departed soul in tribute to his legacy and leadership. We seek from Allah to bless us with more Malay leaders with qualities like Tok Sumang, who prioritised the affairs of his kinsfolk and people, rather than his own affairs._<br>
