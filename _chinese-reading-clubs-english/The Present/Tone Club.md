**About**:	Tone Club is primarily composed of new immigrant communities who actively integrate into local culture while maintaining their own cultural identities and perspectives. The organisation mainly conducts reading exchanges and activities in areas such as arts and literature, personal spiritual growth, and cross-cultural dialogue. The reading club has a lively and thoughtful style, with closely connected members who support each other, creating a positive atmosphere of in-depth discussion and mutual growth.
