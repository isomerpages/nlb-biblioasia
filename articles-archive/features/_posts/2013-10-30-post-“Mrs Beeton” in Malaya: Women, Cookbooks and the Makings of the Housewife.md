#### Cookbooks offer interesting insights into the oft-overlooked domestic space of British Malaya, shedding light on how women saw themselves and how feminine ideals from the West were propagated in the colonial era.

She keeps a casual record of food-related discoveries from the library's collections at eatarchive.tumblr.com.

Cookbooks, pamphlets, newspapers, domestic manuals and the like are rich sources of recipes, diet and nutrition advice as well as kitchen anecdotes and trivia. The non-literary and utilitarian nature of these writings belies their narrative potential as texts that contain rich socio-historical material on food-related culture. Despite their seeming inconsequentiality, details on everyday cooking and eating provide clues to wider debates about national, colonial, postcolonial, class, race and gender politics. English-language cookery texts published in early 20th century British Malaya provide a discursive space where women - whether writing, reading or practising the culinary arts - can participate in fashioning the feminine ideal.

Regarded as the paragon of progressive womanhood in the history of British domesticity, the legacy of Isabella Beeton's magnum opus, *Beeton's Book of Household Management* (1861), refigures Malayan cookery texts beyond the parochial, suggesting the influence of domestic discourses from Victorian England. Cookbooks reproduce dominant gendered ideologies as "explicit emblems of women's relegation to the domestic sphere - the world of the home."1 Yet boundaries shift and blur when these texts also demonstrate how women, ostensibly acting in their traditional capacities as housekeeper and caregiver, could influence the well-being of the family, the wider community and beyond.
 
This essay examines individuals in Malaya who were privileged enough to have received English language education, who saw the value of penning down what they knew and who possessed the wherewithal to publish their writings. The primary focus is on English-language cookbooks, largely due to the relative paucity of extant vernacular cookery texts published in the same period.

#### **The Recipe Book and its implications**

A recipe book may seem unique to the socio-cultural context in which it was written and published, but, it speaks across time when it borrows from earlier works and draws on the conventions of its genre. In contextualising the recipe book within the history of British publishing, Margaret Beetham said: "The systematic reproduction of cooking instructions in commercial forms of print was symptomatic of a much wider process by which oral knowledges (sic) were gradually superseded by print."2 Instructions on food preparation appeared as part of general household advice in printed books of "receipts" that predated the 19th century as well as in magazines and manuals that increasingly targeted a middle-class female readership since the 1850s.3 

Published in 1861, *Beeton's Book of Household Management* was instrumental to the birth of the recipe book as a popular print genre by the end of the century.' Its subsequent publishing history contributed to the transformation of cookery into a subject with its own distinct cultural form. The recipe book thus added to an existing body of writing that mapped the domestic sphere and exposed the otherwise hidden labour performed by women. By instructing women on their expected behaviour and responsibilities in the home, these texts reified and affirmed the assumed conjunction between femininity and domesticity.

Beeton's seminal work was typical of the general household manual of the time, providing an array of advice, anecdotes, trivia, historical notes and other information usually of tangential relevance to the recipes being discussed.5 As Beeton herself acknowledged in the preface of her book, she obtained the bulk of this material from readers' contributions to the first successful middle-class woman's magazine in Britain, *The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine*, published by Isabella's husband, Samuel Beeton.

Her volume nevertheless contained an innovation that has since become a defining characteristic of the recipe book. Beeton "codified a previously chaotic body of knowledge"6 by introducing a standard format for organising and presenting recipes in a systematic way. This includes the listing of ingredients (by weight) followed by the method of preparation and estimated cost for a given recipe, arranging recipes in alphabetical order and providing an index to facilitate the location of information within the dense text.' Furthermore, cooking methods were elaborated in a straightforward and impersonal style.

In this way, Beeton's volume delineated the practicalities of running the home with unprecedented clarity and brevity. This paved the way for "a science of domestic management, one that could be systematically taught through textbooks."8 As a result, Beeton not only articulated the responsibilities and expected conduct of the middleclass woman as the mistress of the household but also provided detailed and precise instructions for the fulfilment of her role. Therein lies the "public normalising impulse"9 of the cookbook, among other household manuals, in setting the criteria for the proper management of the kitchen/ domestic sphere and as the arbiter of consumption.

#### **"Mrs Beeton” arrives in Malaya**

The success of Beeton's book lies in its ability to explicitly address the particular cultural anxieties of its intended audience by offering a feminine ideal to which the women could aspire. Decades after its initial publication, "Mrs Beeton" still spoke with authority and relevance to a new generation of Englishwomen setting up their homes in the far-flung lands of the British Empire.

By the early 20th century, extracts of the original work had been published in booklet form under the name of "Mrs Beeton". Nearly all such spin-offs were recipe or cookery books, thus cementing the association between "Mrs Beeton" and cooking instruction.10 "I used to spend the mornings reading, sewing, and *teaching myself to cook* [emphasis add-ed] out of Mrs Beeton," recalled "V. St. J." of her days as a young expatriate wife residing in the *ulu* [remote] hinterlands of the Malayan peninsula.11 

In Malaya, the recipe book became indispensable to the newly arrived European wife, or *memsahib*12 (often truncated as *mem*), as a guide to reproducing home - or rather the familiar taste of it - abroad. More than a means for educating the self, the recipe book was used to instruct servants where, for example, "with the aid of "Mrs Beeton" and a little tact and courage [the *mem*] may convert a bad or indifferent cook into a quite pre-sentable exponent of the art."13 

Beyond the use of "Mrs Beeton" books in colonial homes, the "presence" of "Mrs Beeton" in Malaya alludes to the translation of feminine domesticity from Victorian England to the Malayan context in the form of texts that deal with cookery. While it is admittedly difficult to determine the extent of direct influence that Beeton's volume had on Malayan cookery texts, "Mrs Beeton", as a symbol of domesticity, an embodiment of the multi-layered nature and discursive potential of the recipe book, as "a practical manual, and a method for scientific education and a fantasy text"14 offer approaches to interpreting the recipe books of Malaya.

#### **The myth of the lazy mem**

"The housewives who come out to Malaya from Europe may be divided into two distinct groups. The first is composed of dilettante wives, who leave everything pertaining to culinary matters and the control of their households entirely to their native staffs, and who, consequently, are forever (sic) complaining of the lack of flavour and nourishment of the food in Malaya and the absence of training and honesty of those who serve them. The other group consists of those who take an intelligent interest in the supplies and preparation of food and all which affects the comfort of their homes. [...] Has it not been said, "Home-making hearts are happiest." — E. M. M. (1933, April 23).

The above observation made by an experienced *mem* implies that the fundamental purpose - in fact, the very happiness - of the English wife in Malaya resides in the conscientious care of the home. The establishment of the English home in colonial territories led to a "physical repositioning of the hitherto private into [...] the most public of realms - the British empire."15 As will be subsequently explained, this intersection of domesticity with imperial power provided an avenue through which European women could advance the work of the British Empire in ways that were consistent with prevailing gender roles.

By maintaining domestic standards, wives were regarded as a civilising influ¬ence that preserved colonial culture and prestige against the perceived degener¬ative tendencies of tropical living.16 The upkeep of the colonial household heavily depended upon the labour of a racially di¬verse team of servants. The responsibili¬ty of overseeing the staff fell to the *mem*, whose conduct and successful adminis-tration of the household mirrored and re¬
