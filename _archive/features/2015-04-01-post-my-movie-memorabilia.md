Given the diverse range of movie-related memorabilia available, aficionados can easily amass huge collections over time. These can include cinema tickets, posters, scripts and other ephemera to film props and costumes as well as bulkier items like cinema seats, cinema projectors and studio camera sets – in short everything related to filmmaking and cinemas. 

I saw my first movie when I was five. My parents had taken me to watch a Taiwanese tear-jerker at the now defunct Kong Chian cinema in Toa Payoh. I will never forget that magical evening, enveloped in the darkness and ensconced in my own seat, my feet barely touching the floor. I have been hooked on movies ever since. Cinemas back then only had one hall, which was usually huge and grand; the screen was often equally large and had the effect of drawing and absorbing you into the movie experience. As my trips to the cinema were infrequent at best while growing up, I treasured each and every film I watched. 

Unfortunately, rapid urbanisation and development, coupled with the introduction of the videotape and other forms of entertainment, caused many cinemas in Singapore to close down in the 1980s. As the number of movie-goers dipped and the film industry declined, I felt compelled to document the loss of these grand movie houses with detailed photographs and ticket stubs. Later on, I expanded my collection to include other film-related memorabilia, and because the items are so diverse, I chose to focus on local productions and films with Asian content. Before I started my collection, I was unaware that Singapore was home to a booming film industry in the late 1940s into the early 70s, but as my collection grew larger, so did my knowledge about Singapore’s golden age of filmmaking. My curiosity was piqued, and my hobby has been growing from strength to strength over the last 30 years.

Initially I faced many challenges; besides having limited means to buy items, there were also space constraints and discouragement from my family (my mum, needless to say, grew increasingly impatient with the clutter gathering in my room). But like-minded friends and people I met in the film business encouraged me. One incident sticks in my memory: in 2006, a warehouse that belonged to the Eng Wah Organisation was destroyed by a fire. What was left of the building was earmarked for demolition but before the bulldozers could tear the building down, I managed to rummage through the rubble and save whatever I could find that was of historical value. I salvaged some paper ephemera but the fire had sadly destroyed all the extant film reels. Searching for film memorabilia is not always so dramatic but neither is it easy. From collector friends to the <i>karung guni</i> (rag-and-bone man), and flea markets, antique shops and online auction sites to overseas trips, I am always on the lookout for a piece of history that helps tell the Singapore film story. 

My lifelong passion for all things connected to films originally started from a place of loss and nostalgia. To me, an artefact that is destroyed or lost translates into a larger (and permanent) loss of Singapore’s history and heritage; this is what fuels my passion to discover and preserve Singapore’s cinematic history through the items I gather. 

Over the past three decades, my collection has evolved into a sizable private archive of memorabilia that celebrates Singapore’s multicultural film and cinema history, one that is closely intertwined with the personal memories of generations of Singaporeans who have grown up watching films – in much the same way I have.
