description: The national anthem that we know today wasn't the original version
  composed by Zubir Said. The first version was longer and pitched at a higher
  key. Emeritus Professor Bernard Tan talks about how "Majulah Singapura" came
  about and how it changed over the decades, and illustrates how these versions
  differ on his piano.
