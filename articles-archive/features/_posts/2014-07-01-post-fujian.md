In this article, Professor Zhang Renfeng examines the letters left by literary scholar and poet Khoo Seok Wan. Through his research on the letters sent to Khoo by four Chinese officials from Fujian, Professor Zhang tries to establish the relationship between these officials and Khoo, piecing together the historical events at the time. These letters reflect the lives of Fujian people then and reveal how the Overseas Chinese were eager to lend a helping hand to those in their homeland in times of trouble. These letters were shared with Professor Zhang, courtesy of Khoo Seok Wan’s descendent, Mr Ong Cheng Kian.
