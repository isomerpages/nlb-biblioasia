#### Lee Kong Chian Research Fellow _Noel Chia Kok Hwee_’s traces the trajectory and importance of imaginative Singapore Children’s Literature in English.

My research is on imaginative Singapore Children’s Literature in English (SCLE) with an emphasis on children’s prose fiction, which can be divided into fantasy and realism (see Lynch-Brown & Tomlinson, 2008; Tomlinson & Lynch-Brown, 2010). Both fantasy and realism involve two literary processing channels1 — imagination and verisimilitude, which provide a link between the world grounded in reality and the meta-world in our minds. Through this meta-cognitive link, readers are able to experience the episodes as described in the stories and through the characters.

The term *imagination* is defined as that literary process of the mind to generate mental images of objects, states or actions not felt or experienced by the senses. Imagination is usually synonymous with “fancy, and commonly opposed to the faculty of reason, either as complementary to it or as contrary to it”.2 According to Sewall (1999) and Roth (2004), imagination helps bridge readers and their environment to create meaningful experiences and understanding of knowledge. It is a fundamental facility through which readers make sense of the world (Norman, 2000; Sutton-Smith, 1988) and also plays an important role in the learning process (Egan, 1992; Norman, 2000).

The other term *verisimilitude* (also known as *truth-likeness*) is the semblance of truth or reality in literary works or the literary principle that requires a consistent illusion of truth to life. It encompasses both the exclusion of improbabilities (as in realism) and the careful disguising of improbabilities in nonrealistic works.3 Verisimilitude also refers to the other literary process that is “often invoked in fantasy and science fiction inviting readers to pretend such stories are true by referring to objects of the mind such as fictional books or years that do not exist apart from an imaginary world” (Roth, 2004, p. 10). This imaginary world is also known as *meta-world* (Chia, 1991).

By seeing the world around them in new ways and by considering ways of living other than their own, children increase their ability to think divergently. Stories often map the divergent paths that our ancestors might have taken or that our descendants might someday take. “Through the vicarious experience of entering a world different from the present one, children develop their imaginations. In addition, stories about people, both real and imaginary, can inspire children to overcome obstacles, accept different perspectives, and formulate personal goals.” (Lynch Brown & Tomlinson, 2008, p. 5)

Moreover, children’s books with a high degree of *imaginativity*4 provide the highest level of *reader enchantment*, which is an endogenous process that stimulates a reader’s mind. This process throws readers into that meta-world where they can take part in any adventure, journey or exploration (Chia, 2004). It makes readers want to go on and not stop reading. In this sense, they have gone beyond automaticity. They are now a part of that story and have become either like *avatars* participating in the fantasy world, or like *morpheus* watching the events gradually unfolding. The final outcome is a sensitive awareness of imaginativity in children’s literature.

Promoting SCLE by encouraging reading for pleasure among our children demands special effort in translating written language or print into *meta-worlds* (or realms of fantasy) — “worlds within worlds whose reality is primarily in the mind” (Roloff, 1973). Though a meta-world is a reality only within the mental boundaries of the mind, the existence of such realms can be readily accepted by most readers (Chia, 1991, 1996). Regardless of how peculiar or remote it may seem, readers should be sufficiently convinced that the *meta-world* really exists — they must believe in it and need to suspend their disbelief (just as if they were role-playing). This is the power of imagination that good children’s literature can help promote.

#### **The Changing Landscape (1965—2005)**

SCLE evolved as ideas surrounding it and perspectives changed. In the past, SCLE “was largely concentrated on reading materials rather than fiction proper, \[whereas\] the current trend shows a move towards better fiction though it is largely folktales and picture book fiction” (National Library Board, 2005, p. 3). For SCLE to attract a wider readership there is a need for our writers, illustrators and/or publishers to expand the scope of imagination.

My original research surveyed the changing landscape of SCLE from 1965 to 2005, using the Imaginativity Rating Scale (IRS) to measure changing levels of imaginativity. However, my focus in this article is the descriptive findings of the study; I reserve its quantitative findings for another paper. I examine the development of SCLE over time, looking for that which “would ideally represent the authentic voice of the Singapore child” (Hassan, 2006, p. 16), and the various significant historical events that affected it. I have divided the 40 years into five periods: the Didactic Period (1960s), the Pioneering Period (1970s), the Emergent Period (1980s), the Progressive Period (1990s), and the New Millennium (2000s)

#### **The Didactic Period (1960s)**

One of the early roadblocks to the growth of Singapore children’s literature has been its poor commercial viability, due to the small local market. As early as 1966, the then Minister for Education Mr Ong Pang Boon said,

It is not only desirable but essential to have local<br>authors write the books we need, especially authors<br> who understand the role of authorship in relation to<br> the new political status and urgent social needs of <br>our country. It is only local authors who could have a<br> sense of social awareness, a real understanding of<br> the various aspects of the local environment and above<br> all a true appreciation of the national aspirations and <br>strivings of our people, and contribute by making <br>appropriate references and allusions to local conditions<br> and factors, and by consciously emphasising points of<br> view more in conformity with the spirit of the times, and<br> with our national needs and aspirations. (as cited in<br> Girvin, 1976, p. 7)

A scan of the SCLE available during the 1960s at the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library reveals that basal readers were used in many English-medium schools and outnumbered quality children’s fiction on all counts. This reflected the Singapore government’s policy during this period “to get the general populace to put a premium on education, and the habit of reading began to be developed as part and parcel of the learning process” (Kong & Tay, 1998, p. 8). Besides, the parents, being very pragmatic, “look only for books ‘useful’ in boosting their children’s school performance” (Khoo, 1992, p. 101)

I was able to identify only one trade book published during this period: Sylvia Sherry’s *Street of the Small Night Market* (1966). Others were merely basal readers such as the *Federal Supplementary Readers Third Year(Book 3)* (1961), the *Federal Readers Book 1* (1963), and *Structural English Course Reader 4* (1968). It was in a third course reader that I found an interesting story, *The King of Fishes* (1968) by Chia Meng Ann and Chia Hearn Chek. “Although the literature addressed reading discovery, it was positioned to address reading needs first and often the tone of the materials was didactic if not dull.” (National Library Board, 2005, p. 2)
