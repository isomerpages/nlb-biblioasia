 ####  Lee Kong Chian Research Fellow _Phyllis Ghim-Lian Chew_ draws from the social and linguistic history of colonial Singapore, and proposes a plurality-solidarity cline with parameters such as dress, food, the arts, religious and literary activities, and rites of passage, as a means to study the processes of acculturation and assimilation.

Some foods have become such a part of everyday life in Singapore that their origins have been largely forgotten, and various races have each claimed these dishes as part of their traditional cuisines. Examples of some of these foods include sugee cake, fruit cake, pineapple *tart*, *agar-agar*, curry puff, meat patty, butter cake and *kaya*; these are believed to have originated from the Eurasian community (Marbeck, 2004). In a similar way, the following dishes and desserts that are part of the mainstream Malay menu, were originally Chinese: *char kuay teow*, *tau suan*, *bubor terigu*, *mee rebus*, *tahu goreng* and *laksa*. *Roti prata* (or *roti cana*i in Malaysia), while an Indian derivative, is a favourite among all ethnic groups.

Yet, instead of celebrating this dynamic multiculturalism in Singapore food, Lai (2006) and Pereira (2003) note a tendency to highlight the divisive potential of race, religion and language. Many social scientists have labelled Singapore a “plural society” (Furnivall, 1956, p. 304) where people of different religions, cultures and languages “live side by side, but separately … meeting only in the market-place … mixing but not combining.” While it may be more newsworthy to focus on plurality and separateness, I will instead postulate a plurality-solidarity cline and draw from the social and linguistic history of colonial Singapore as a means to examine the extent of acculturation and assimilation that lay hidden beneath the seemingly divisive veneer of multiculturalism.

#### **A Three-Generation Model: The Plurality-Solidarity Cline**

Our acculturation-assimilation continuum begins with plurality at one end, and solidarity at the other. While plurality conjures images of dissent and divisiveness, solidarity connotes cooperation and peaceful exchange.

Both acculturation and assimilation are degrees in the process of cultural integration. While acculturation sees cultural groups remaining as distinct entities, assimilation, which is found further along the cline, is a condition where the distinction among the groups becomes indistinguishable. To illustrate, we may place a first generation Chinese *coolie* (labourer) on one end of the cline and the second or third generation equivalent in the middle or far end of the cline. Where a newcomer is concerned, he is likely to speak in only his mother tongue, eat the cheapest of meals, and wear his ethnic (Chinese) clothes. Somewhere along the middle of the cline, we have the second or third generation, probably speaking native Malay, eating meals cooked with local ingredients such as tamarind and lemongrass, and wearing a Malayan outfit instead of traditional Chinese costume.

This simple model assumes that the newcomer and his offspring would adopt the values, behaviours and characteristics of the mainstream culture in a “straight-line” progression. It also presumes that those who live in an environment for a long time tend to adapt to the dominant culture more easily than newcomers. The spoken vocabulary used may also indicate where the person is on the cline. For example, Shellabear (1913) surmised that when a Chinese man calls his father *n-tia* (father, in Chinese dialect) rather than *papa*, he probably belongs to an earlier generation. Similarly in the Malacca Chetty (descendants of Indian men from South India and local women from Malacca) community (Thiyagaraj, 1998), it has been said that what instantly differentiates a newcomer from a member of the earlier generation would be his use of *belacan* (dried shrimp paste mixed with pounded chillies), *belimbing* (a tiny acidic fruit) and *chilli padi* (tiny hot chillies) in his cooking!

The speed of transculturation of a new migrant is affected by personal and socio-political variables. For example, when a penniless migrant arrives in colonial Singapore, he would naturally seek out people who can speak his native language and who can help him to understand the “strange” culture around him. He is likely to stay in an enclave of linguistically similar people and, for survival, may be tempted to join clans or secret societies to alleviate the state of anomie that he is experiencing. Such groups and societies would provide him with an environment where familiar norms and values are practised. In this sense the plurality of the society is accentuated. However, there would come a time, the migrant after having paid off his bond, is likely to move out of his enclave to a new area to seek new opportunities for business or perhaps, marriage. Being able to stand on his own two feet and no longer a bonded employee, the migrant would quickly learn the *linguas franca* — in Singapore’s context, English, Malay and Hokkien.

Marriage plays a crucial role in the transculturation of new migrants. For example, if the *singkeh* (new arrival from China) marries a local-born woman, their children would be speedily acculturated to the local customs and way of life. However, if he were to marry, say, an entertainment artiste who is also a new migrant, the acculturation process might be much slower. In another example, if the migrant were to decide to get a wife from China, the acculturation process may be temporarily impeded as the woman would tend to follow her village culture, not the local culture. In instances of interracial marriage, the result is an interesting hybrid identity. Reid (1993) notes that some of the maritime and commercial people recognised by the Portuguese by labels such as Jawa, Malay, Luzon and Jawi are likely to have been the result of such Chinese hybrids.

It is not just the newcomer who journeys on the cline but also the indigene. In other words, acculturation is more likely to be a two-way process of bicultural blending rather than a zero-sum game where one culture is replaced completely by another. As a case in point, we see the Malays in Singapore adopting some Hokkien terms in their speech. This might be seen as a symbolic act of welcome and hospitality. For example, in spoken Malay, the days of the week were adapted from Hokkien *pai-it*, *pai-zi*, *pai za* (weekdays 1, 2, 3) through the use of *hari satu*, *hari dua*, *hari tiga*. This is seen as a variation of the standard Islamicinfluenced terms: *hari isnin*, *hari selasa* and *hari rabu*. The Malays have also unconsciously absorbed much of Hokkien’s lexis through their usage of words such as *beca* (trishaw), *bihun* (vermicelli), *cat* (paint), *cinca*i (anyhow), *guli* (marbles), *kentang* (potato), *kamcent* (sprout), *tahu* (bean curd) and *tauke* (boss). In reciprocity, the later-generation Chinese Hokkiens have also adopted many Malay words in their vocabulary, such as *agak* (guess), *botak* (bald), *champur* (mix), *gadoh* (fight), *jamban* (toilet), *kachau* (disturb), *longkang* (drain), *roti* (bread) and *tolong* (help).
