#### As a journalist, R.B. Ooi always had his finger on the pulse of Malaya, bringing to fore issues at the heart of the nation.
By Linda Lim

Being in a war zone is always dangerous, even for non-combatants, as R.B. Ooi, the former editor for the Singapore Standard and the Eastern Sun could attest.

During the Malayan Emergency (1948–60), Ooi worked as a press officer to General Gerald Templer, the British High Commissioner for Malaya, who had been tasked to deal with the communist guerillas. In a 1969 letter to his daughter, Irene Lim, Ooi wrote that he had spent three years “covering the jungle war for the government, local and foreign press…” That meant spending time with British troops in the jungle. And while they tried not to draw attention, apparently, the communists knew they were there. Ooi further wrote that a surrendered Malay communist had come up to him and asked what they had been doing in the jungle near Bentong, Pahang, with a Gurkha patrol. “He and his men were waiting to ambush the Gurkhas when he saw us following the Gurkhas in thick jungle with film camera and still camera. He thought we were from Hollywood, so did not shoot…”[^1]

Ooi also had to worry about being shot by the British as well. “Once I was sent to the jungle to study the morale of British troops. Those young soldiers were scared stiff when they entered a rubber estate. One of them tripped over a wire and set off an alarm in a hill. The soldiers ran up the hill firing like mad and so we had to run with them or else we might be fired upon by both sides…  Those were dangerous years for me and two of my cameramen colleagues. I should have got an OBE [The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire] for that.”[^2]

R.B. Ooi, born Ooi Chor Hooi (1905–72), was my maternal grandfather. He was one of the earliest local Malayan journalists writing in English and had worked for newspapers from the Straits Echo to the Malayan Times. In 2023, Irene Lim – his daughter and my mother – donated his personal papers and photos to the National Library of Singapore. These are now held in the R.B. Ooi and Edna Kung Collection. His writings give us a window into discourses – such as multiculturalism and the Malayan identity – that publicly preoccupied the English-educated in the colonial and immediate post-colonial periods in Singapore and Malaysia. 

<b>Career in Journalism</b><br>
Ooi started out as a junior reporter for the Penang-based newspaper, Straits Echo, in 1923. He was the first Chinese reporter among other Ceylon-Eurasian, British and Australian staff. In 1924, he joined the Treasury in Kuala Lumpur as a clerk. Between 1929 and 1933, Ooi worked as an assistant secretary at the Pontianak Gold Mine, which was owned by his father-in-law, Kung Tian Siong. He then went on to work for Duncan Roberts, managing the International Correspondence Schools at 10 Collyer Quay in Singapore. Ooi also moonlighted as a part-time reporter for the Straits Echo from 1923–28, and the Malaya Tribune from 1934 to 42, under the penname R.B. Ooi.

In 1942, the family left Singapore for Bukit Mertajam in Province Wellesley (now Seberang Prai), Malaysia, having been informed by Ooi’s “Malay journalist friend” (possibly Yusof Ishak, who later became the first president of Singapore in 1965) that he was on a death blacklist for anti-Japanese articles he had published before the Japanese Occupation (1942–45).[^3] A year later, Ooi got a job at Juru Rubber Estate in Province Wellesley, an experience that provided much material for his later articles on “life in the _ulu_” (_ulu_ referring to remote wild places).

Returning to Singapore after the war, Ooi became chief reporter, then sub-editor and columnist for the _Malaya Tribune_ (1945–49). He then worked for the Information Department in Kuala Lumpur as a press officer in 1949 (until 1954) during the Malayan Emergency.&nbsp;

From 1954–58, Ooi was the editor-in-chief of the _Singapore Standard_. He rejoined the Information Department in 1958 and was appointed Head of the Press and Liaison sections in May 1960. He was the editor-in-chief of the _Malayan Times_ (1962–65) and later the _Eastern Sun_ in Singapore (1966–68).

After his stint at the _Eastern Sun_, Ooi became a freelance writer (penning a regular column titled “Impromptu” for the _Straits Echo_) and broadcaster (hosting a monthly current affairs radio talk show called “Window on the World”). In 1968, he received the Ahli Mangku Negara (Defender of the Realm) decoration from the Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia. Ooi’s last column was published in the _Straits Echo_ shortly after his death in Kuala Lumpur in December 1972.
