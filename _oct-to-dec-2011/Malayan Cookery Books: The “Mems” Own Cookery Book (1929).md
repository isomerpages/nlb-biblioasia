#### Senior Librarian _Bonny Tan_ details and offers insights into the 1929 _The “Mem’s” Own Cookery Book_.

**"[The] authoress confines herself to such dishes as can be prepared from readily obtainable materials locally, and which should prove to be within the capacity of even the usually "bodoh" \[ignorant\] specimen of cookie \[cook\]." (Untitled. (1922, May 5). Straits Times, p. 10, NL 494)"**

#### **A Colonial Family in Malaya** 

Much more is known of Mr Kinsey and his family than of Mrs Kinsey herself. William Edward Kinsey’s father had come from Liverpool to Malaya in 1892 to manage the Pahang Exploration and Development Company which had set up several sawmills in the midst of violent local reactions to the presence of the British. Twenty-two year old W. E. Kinsey joined his father in 1898. In 1902, he switched to the government service as Inspector of Mines in Negri Sembilan and remained a civil servant until his retirement in 1925 as Deputy Conservator of Forests of Negri Sembilan and Malacca.

What is known today about Mrs Kinsey is that she could cook! "Her skill as a maker of delicious dishs [sic] was well known. She did her own cooking on an oil-stove on the back verandah behind her dining room."' This was considered unusual as "Mems"2 usually had a cook and servants to do the actual kitchen work. She was also known for her fruit preserves and had been recognised by the Wembley Exhibition for an exhibit of pickles, chutney and jams made of Malayan fruit.3 Again, her determination to make her own preserves won her admiration amongst those who reviewed her recipes almost a decade later. "What strikes me is that a European `mem' should have found the time to make kundangan chutney. European women today have just as much spare time as they had in Mrs Kinsey's day — perhaps more, if you take into account the car and the telephone and provisions delivered at your door — but can you see them making kundagan chutney in their own kitchens?".4 It was her passion for churning out these dishes by herself that enriched every one of her recipes.
