I grew up in the kampung at Jalan Nanas (the area now occupied by the Eunos MRT station) and until today, I still remember the cohesiveness of the neighbours and villagers, the Gotong Royong spirit during any festive seasons. I remember that it always flooded every December, which coincided with Hari Raya \[during those years\], and the villagers would use a bucket system to clear the water.

The flooding made the soil very fertile though, and the villagers would plant vegetables like kangkong, daun kesum \[laksa leaf\] and daun kari \[curry leaf\]. The villagers would also rear livestock such as chicken, geese and ducks. These scenes are forever entrenched in my memory. — *Hajah Hameedah binte Mohamed Ibrahim*

I remember the joy and colours whenever there was a wedding taking place in our village at Kaki Bukit. The whole village would come together to celebrate the occasion in the true spirit of Gotong Royong!  — *Absah Mingan*

#### ***Gotong Royong in the Kampung Life***

"Gotong royong is a traditional Malay concept whereby people living in a kampung (village) do things together and help each other in the spirit of goodwill and reciprocity, knowing that one can count on the support of one’s neighbours during times of need. “ — *Hidayah Amin*[^1]
