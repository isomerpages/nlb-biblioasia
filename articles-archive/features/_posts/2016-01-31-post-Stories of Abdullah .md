Quite ironically, the most detailed account of Stamford Raffles’ momentous arrival in Singapore was captured by a man who was not even there. Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir, better known as Munsyi Abdullah, gathered reports from those present to piece together 
a version of the events that occurred during 
Raffles’ first arrival to Singapore on 29 January 1819.1
 This landmark narrative is included 
in his autobiography Hikayat Abdullah, or Stories of Abdullah, one of the most important 
records of the socio-political landscape in 
Singapore, Melaka and the southern Malay 
kingdoms of Johor and Riau-Lingga at the 
turn of the 19th century.
Written in Jawi – modified Arabic script 
used to write the Malay language – between 
1840 and 1843 and published in 1849, the book 
is considered compulsory reading among 
scholars of Malay literature and culture and 
is the most renowned of Abdullah’s works.2
Until the 1970s, it was used as a textbook in 
every Malay school in Singapore.3
Born in Melaka in 1797, young Abdullah studied under the best Malay scholars 
in his hometown and read all the Malay 
manuscripts he could find. By the time he 
was 11, the child prodigy was already making money from writing Qur’anic texts and 
teaching religion to Indian soldiers stationed 
in Melaka. The soldiers called him “munsyi”, 
which means “teacher of language” – a title 
he would carry for the rest of his life. By 
14, Abdullah had become an accomplished 
Malay scholar.4
 He went on to teach Malay to 
some of the most eminent administrators, 
scholars and missionaries in the Straits of 
Melaka, including Raffles.5
As a scribe and interpreter for Raffles, and a Malay teacher to several English 
personages, Abdullah had a front-row seat 
to the political and cultural developments of 
the time. His perceptive insights, combined 
with a penchant for vivid descriptions, would 
give future readers of his book a rich picture 
of 19th-century life and personalities in 
Singapore and the region.6
Among other things, the Hikayat chronicles the three changes of the European 
guard in Melaka, the establishment of the
