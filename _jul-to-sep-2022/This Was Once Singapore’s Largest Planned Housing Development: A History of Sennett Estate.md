At first glance, there is little to suggest that Sennett Estate, a housing development in Potong Pasir just off MacPherson Road, is particularly noteworthy. It looks like any typical suburb, with its quiet streets lined with houses that were originally built in the 1950s. However, this unassuming estate represents an interesting milestone in the history of home development in Singapore. 

Developed in response to the post-war housing crunch, Sennett Estate was once dubbed the biggest planned housing estate in Singapore.[^1] And within the 170 acres that make up this quiet estate are stories that link the place to Singapore’s larger history: to a time when wealthy Arab families owned large tracts of land and also to a period in crime-infested Singapore when kidnapping was a common occurrence. It is even, somewhat improbably, tied to the Konfrontasi. 

#### **Alkaff Lake Gardens**

Before Sennett Estate came into being, the area was principally known for the Alkaff Lake Gardens. In the late 1920s, the park was developed by Syed Shaik Abdul Rahman Alkaff of the Alkaff family, a prominent Arab family of merchants and property developers.[^2]

“Eighteen years ago, the idea of converting the site into a park occurred to me,” he said in a 1948 newspaper interview. “A building contractor suggested that we should decorate the site with Japanese tea-houses, side-walks lined with granite chips, Japanese arches and bridges,” he said. Alkaff then hired a Japanese landscape expert to develop what has been described as Singapore’s very first Japanese-style garden across 10 acres (40.5 sq m) of land, which opened to the public in 1929. 

Alkaff Lake Gardens quickly became a popular evening and weekend resort for families, couples and office workers. Featuring artificial hills and a man-made lake, visitors could go boating on the lake, fishing and picnic under shady trees. The idyllic spot also offered tea houses that could be rented, interspersed among quaint Japanese bridges and manicured shrubbery.

In 1935, Chinese merchant Tan Aik Kee of Nanyang Amusement Co. took over the management of the park and introduced Chinese elements. Chinese-style boathouses reminiscent of dwellings along the Pearl River in Guangzhou were constructed along with Chinese pavilions as well as the introduction of Chinese white and pink lotus flowers. A cinema and a cabaret were even in the works. However, the park fell into disuse by the late 1930s.
