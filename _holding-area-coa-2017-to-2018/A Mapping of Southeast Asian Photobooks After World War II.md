#### **Introduction**
There has been a surge in interest in photobooks since 2004, triggered by the
publication of a series of richly illustrated volumes by publisher Phaidon,
such as *The Photobook: A History Volume I (2004), The Photobook: A History
Volume II* (2006) and *The Photobook: A History Volume III* (2014). The
mastermind behind this series is British collector-photographer Martin
Parr, with critic-photographer Gerry Badger as its lead writer. Today, there
are fairs, festivals and symposiums dedicated to the photobook across the
world. It is fair to say that Parr has been hugely responsible for surfacing the
photobook as a field of interest and an object of desire.

In the preface of *The Photobook: A History Volume I*, Parr claims that
the photobook is the “final frontier of the undiscovered” in the research
of photography. Hence, his promotion of the photobook is an attempt
to “narrate a new history of photography”.[^1] Together, Badger and
Parr position the photobook at the chasms “between the aesthetic and
contextual battalions in the photo-critical wars”, and between art and the
mass medium, offering, in effect, a third way for photographers, curators,
collectors and art historians to approach photography.[^2]

Because the titles featured in these volumes are largely based on Parr’s
enormous collection of photobooks, the selection is inevitably subjective and
eclectic. Materials – such as company books and propaganda publications
– frequently disparaged by art historians, curators and even photographers
themselves receive serious treatment from the series, partly because Parr is
personally invested in these photobooks. In a limited way, this has helped to
broaden the art of photography. Parr adds, “We have gone out of our way to
be inclusive, welcoming books from countries beyond the usual European-
American axis, which are normally overlooked in other histories”.[^3] Hence,
out of the 472 books chosen for the first two volumes of *The Photobook* series,
some have been placed in the chapter “Other Territories: The Worldwide
Photobook”, while productions from Japan are featured in the chapter,
“Provocative Materials for Thought: The Postwar Japanese Photobook”.

While Parr repeatedly notes that all histories are subjective, what they
have authored here is, of course, a global history written from a European
perspective. This becomes apparent through a casual reading of the writings
in these volumes where the references are overwhelmingly Euro-American
and the arguments intended as universal proclamations. While they claim
to attempt an “unofficial revisionist history” of photography through the
valorisation of photobooks, their account is based on and inevitably bound to
the official historiography, which continues to operate from imperial centres.[^4]

This explains their claim, 10 years after the publication of *The Photobook:
A History Volume I*, that there is now a global photographic culture and
that the “photobook can be said to have been responsible for at least one
conspicuous success in the ongoing story of globalization”.[^5] Globalisation,
in this sense, refers to the uni-directional export of the photobook craze to
the rest of the world, as there is little evidence in the publications of Parr
and Badger to suggest that photobooks from any place in Asia, for instance,
have significantly impacted communities of practitioners in the imperial
centres. Furthermore, when they make the universalising claim that the
photobook has been more important to the history of creative photography than the mass-media journal or the gallery print, it is clear that experiences
in Southeast Asia have not been taken into account.[^6]

While Parr and Badger assert that they have no interest in creating a new
canon in photography, the Phaidon publications have effectively accelerated
the canonisation and commodification of photobooks, chiefly benefitting
Parr and his associates.[^7] In effect, their narrative leaves photobook
productions from Southeast Asia outside of history and historiography.
When a photobook from Southeast Asia appears in their selection, it serves
to legitimise their global and eclectic taste. In other words, when they pick
publications from the “peripheral” regions of the world to fit this global
project, their selection inevitably helps to entrench the universality of the
Euro-American narrative of photography.

#### **Defining the Photobook**
Before turning our focus onto Southeast Asia, it is worthwhile to revisit
the ways in which the photobook has been defined in the current spate of
canonisation. To quote Parr and Badger at length:

   *A photobook is a book – with or without text – where the work’s<br>
   primary message is carried by photographs. It is a book authored<br>
   by a photographer or by someone editing and sequencing the work<br>
   of a photographer, or even a number of photographers…. For the<br>
   most part, we have considered the photobook as a specific ‘event’<br>
   … in which a group of photographs is brought together between<br>
   covers, each image placed so as to resonate with its fellows as the<br>
   pages are turned, making the collective meaning more important<br>
   than the images’ individual meanings…. As we define it, the<br>
   photobook has a particular subject – a specific theme…. And<br>
   in the main, it will not simply be a survey of a photographer’s<br>
   ‘greatest hits’, a career review. Monographs, or anthologies of<br>
   a particular photographer’s work at a given time in his or her<br>
   career have therefore not been included.*[^8]
	 
Having provided what seems like an all-encompassing definition of the
photobook, they immediately temper it by including in their selection
the monographs of Henri Cartier-Bresson (*The Decisive Moment*, 1952)
and Walker Evans (*American Photographs*, 1938), while excluding those
made by some of the most important American Pictorialists, such as
Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Weston and Ansel Adams. According to Parr and
Badger, while the publications of the Pictorialists are typically sumptuous
in production, they are more like anthologies than cogent photobooks.[^9]
And yet, in *The Chinese Photobook: From the 1900s to the Present* (2015),
co-edited by Parr – again based on his ever-growing collection – and
WassinkLundgren (with Badger serving as a contributor), anthologies
and exhibition catalogues such as *Peking Light Society Annual* (1929)
and *Holidays in Hong Kong* (1968) from the milieus of Pictorialism are
included in the selection.[^10] There is no doubt that these are significant
publications in the history of China photography. The same can be said
of the photobooks made by the aforementioned American Pictorialists,
*vis-à-vis* the historiography of American photography. Why do Parr and
his associates treat the productions of American and China Pictorialists
differently? It is beyond the scope of this paper to delve into the question.
But if I may suggest a possible reason, the discrepancy is perhaps due
to the fact that the imprint of the American Pictorialists has already
been fully acknowledged in the history of global photography, whereas
the historiography of China photography remains a work-in-progress,
especially for the English-speaking world. In this context, it is possible that
Parr and WassinkLundgren had felt somewhat obliged to present a history
of China photography via their valorisation of photobooks.

Returning to the issue of definition, U.S.-based Jörg Colberg, a widely
followed proponent of the photobook, offers a slightly different view. He
defines the photobook as a book that is viewed primarily for its photographs.
This is different from a cookbook, for instance, which is probably read for
its recipes rather than photographs.[^11] In contrast, Parr and Badger devote
a full chapter in *The Photobook: A History Volume II* to the company book because many of the greatest photographers produced books that had been
subsidised and commissioned by commercial corporations.[^12]

Colberg considers albums, catalogues and monographs as the three
subcategories of the photobook, differing from the definition offered by
Parr and Badger. He also uses the term monograph differently from Parr and
Badger, although it is clear that both parties actually valorise the same kind
of object. Colberg demarcates the *monograph* from the catalogue, which
typically does not feature a narrative arc. In contrast, it is very difficult to
remove a photograph or a page from a monograph without dramatically
altering the book. The placement of the photographs and the overall design
create the “connective tissue” that makes the monograph more than just a
sum of its parts.[^13]

Like most proponents of the photobook, Colberg cannot help but speak
of it in a somewhat mythologising manner. He adds, “When a photobook
is made well, it is quite likely that you will not notice many of the great
decisions that went into its making. That, ultimately, is the goal: while
problems with photobooks are like hangnails that can be noticed even by
those who do not know much about photobooks, many of the properties of
perfectly made photobooks can only be appreciated by experts (designers,
book binders, editors) or people who are aware of the various details to look
out for”.[^14] Parr and Badger express a similar sentiment: “Often the difference
between a great photobook and a good photobook is an indefinable quality
that one recognizes when one sees it”. They add, rather perspicaciously, “Of
course, photobooks have become extremely desirable objects in their own
right. There is an element of fetishism at work”.[^15] 

Indeed, the transfer of the photobook hype to Southeast Asia has already
generated a degree of fetishism. A case in point is the setting up of the
Facebook group, ominously titled Photobook Fetish Singapore, by Invisible
Photographer Asia (IPA) in 2015. Fetish for the smell of ink and the sound
of a falling page in a photobook arrived via German printer Gerhard Steidl
through his collaborations with designer Theseus Chan and DECK, a photo gallery in Singapore. Perhaps it is unsurprising that the fetish finds a ready
audience in Singapore, one of the richest nations in Southeast Asia.

These definitions of the photobook have largely been articulated from Euro-
American experiences and universalising desires. While not discounting
their usefulness, they remain problematic on different levels. In this paper,
I will surface and consolidate our experiences in making photobooks across
Southeast Asia since 1945. In this context, it is paramount that we begin with
a definition of the photobook that is as open-ended as possible. This will
hopefully prevent certain types of publications from being excluded simply
because they do not fit within the parameters of existing definitions. Here,
I define the photobook as any publication with substantial photographic
content. By surveying the collections in the National Library Board (NLB),
I aim to create an evolving typology of photobooks based on our experiences
in Southeast Asia.

What counts as a Southeast Asian photobook? Does the nationality of
its author or location of its publisher define whether a photobook is
Malaysian or Thai? In most cases, people would consider a book to be
Vietnamese, if, for instance, its creator were Vietnamese. I do not disagree
with such an inclination, even though this disguises the fact that the
photobook, like photography itself, is a product that traverses national
borders. *Viet Nam in Flames*, for instance, was published around 1969
with the support of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic
of Vietnam (ARVN).[^16] The photographers involved were Nguyê˜n Ma·nh
Đan (b. 1925, Nam Dinh Province–d. 2019) and Major Nguyê˜n Ngo· c
Ha· nh (b. 1927, Ha Dong–d. 2017, San Jose). The English-language
version of the photobook offered an account of the Vietnam War from
the perspective of the South Vietnamese establishment in an attempt to
garner global support. Unsurprisingly, in the virtual sphere today, there
are very few passing references in the Vietnamese language concerning
this photobook.[^17] Perhaps to ensure its quality, Kwok Hing Printing Press
in Hong Kong was entrusted with the printing of the photobook. Before
the 1997 British handover to China, Hong Kong had been an important
printing hub for publishers around the world, especially those with an
active presence in East Asia and Southeast Asia. In short, *Viet Nam in Flames* is a hybrid product informed by Hong Kong print technology and
a presumed target audience mainly located outside of Vietnam.

By extension, I wish to suggest that it is also possible to consider a
photobook to be Laotian, for instance, if the subject matter is deemed to
be Lao. The main intent is to temper the authority of the auteur, allowing
those who appear in the photobook their inalienable rights as collaborators
to claim (or reject) the publication. Naturally, instead of considering every
tatty book published about Laos as a Lao photobook, it would only be
productive to re-contextualise publications by photographers from elsewhere
who have developed a longstanding and committed relationship with their
sitters. By identifying a photobook through the claims of its sitters, we
also allow them conversely to reject association with all the problematic
publications in circulation.

Finally, it is worth remembering that Southeast Asia is not a regional
framing that has come from within. The geographical terms of “Nanyang”
in Chinese, “Nampo” in Japanese or “Nusantara” in Malay all predate
“Southeast Asia”. The latter started creeping into popular use following the
establishment of the Southeast Asia Command, an Allied force set up during
World War II to “liberate” the region. After the war, driven by the U.S.’ desire to dominate the entire region between India and China, Southeast
Asia became a region of strategic importance and an area of scholarship.[^18] 
Since then, the idea of Southeast Asia has gained limited traction from
within. While it is beyond the scope of this paper to further unpack the
imaginary of Southeast Asia, we should, at the very least, take it as an
evolving geographical framing that may or may not include places such as
Timor-Leste, Papua New Guinea, Sri Lanka, Hong Kong or even Christmas
Island. This is not a call to increase the clout of Southeast Asia in order to
redress the balance of power in Asia. Instead, this ever-morphing sense of
the region serves to remind us of the problematic origins of Southeast Asia,
while marking a productive space within to do inter-referencing work;[^19] 
in full recognition that we share enough similarities and differences in our
cultural and political experiences to make critical comparisons worthwhile.
This should prevent us from glossing over the imprint of Hong Kong or
China, for instance, in our photobook experiences across Southeast Asia.

#### **Locating Photobooks in NLB’s Collections**
Photobooks have been produced since the inception of photography. Early
examples include Anna Atkins’ *Photographs of British Algae: Cyanotype
Impressions* (1843–53) and William Henry Fox Talbot’s *The Pencil of Nature*
(1844–46). In contrast, the current valorisation of the photobook form has
been cultivated only since 2004. If we search the NLB catalogue using the
keyword “photobook”, the results will be extremely limited. Previously,
when a photobook was added to the NLB catalogue, the term “photobook”
was not used to tag the entry’s subject field. The common term used then
was “pictorial works”. The content is sometimes indicated, with the creation
of subject tags such as “Vietnam – Pictorial works” or “Cats – Pictorial
works”. However, the subject tags of “pictorial works” and “photobook”
do not always refer to the same kind of object, as the former can denote,
for instance, a book of illustrations. For the small number of publications
tagged as “photobook”, almost all of them were published during and after 2007. An alternative is to look at the “physical description” field of each title
in the NLB catalogue to ascertain if the publication contains illustrations or plates. Of course, this is not a sure-fire way of locating photobooks within
NLB’s collections.

In May 2018, I met a photobook enthusiast from England who had
recently relocated to Singapore. To acquaint himself with photobooks
produced in Southeast Asia, he visited the reference section of the National
Library at Victoria Street. Books on photography are typically found in
the Singapore &amp; Southeast Asia Collection, segregated from similar titles
published elsewhere in the world. In the reference section, he noticed that
photo-related publications from Southeast Asia, including photobooks,
filled only slightly more than a shelf. As a region peripheral to the Euro-
American centres of art, this was perhaps unsurprising to him, even though
he remained unconvinced that the region had produced so few photobooks.
In truth, his way of locating Southeast Asian photobooks in the National
Library is common, even for Singaporeans who assume that Singapore has
only ever published English books throughout its history. There are other
Southeast Asian photobooks produced in other languages, which can be
found in the library’s Malay and Chinese collections.

In fact, if we return to the definition of the photobook that I proposed
earlier, then photobooks can be found across the different collections within
NLB. Hence, in order to generate a typology of photobooks in Southeast
Asia, it is important to physically flip through a publication to see if its
photographic content forms a substantial component. Although it will take
months or years to do so, this is technically possible for publications that
can be physically accessed in the National Library’s reference section and
the borrowing collections in libraries across the country. However, there
are many publications that are not accessible on-site at the libraries, such as
the Reference Used (RU) and PublicationSG (PubSG) collections. While
the Rare Collection holds titles published before 1945, which fall beyond
the scope of my research, the Reference Closed (RCLOS), RU and PubSG
collections likely hold many publications that would fit my definition of the
photobook. RCLOS titles can be accessed on-site at the National Library,
but RU and PubSG collections are located off-site, complicating the
research process, as they need to be requested specifically by title instead of
browsing at the shelves.

On a practical level, it is impossible to flip through most of the titles within
the NLB collections. This is testament to the massive collection that NLB
has amassed over the years. Thus, one of the key challenges has been to make
an intelligent guess based on the information available in each catalogue entry, so that the process of requesting for a potential photobook from the
RCLOS, RU and PubSG collections would at least yield the right type of
publication, while recognising the risk of missing out a peculiar publication
that might complicate the typology that I wish to produce here. In short,
the typology that I intend to map can only be evolving.

#### **Translating the Photobook: Terminologies**
Photographic publications have been produced by practitioners from the
region long before the current craze in photobooks. As this craze trickles back
to parts of Asia, the term “photobook”, in some cases, has had to be translated
or re-adapted for localised usage. In Vietnam, for instance, *sách anh*, which
literally means “photobook”, is commonly used.[^20] Similarly, in Myanmar,
“photobook” is translated as *dat-pone sar-oak*.[^21] Sometimes, even a fairly
straightforward translation of the term “photobook” might bring about a
sense of consternation. For example, photo curator Ahmad Salman (b. 1970,
Semarang) insists that the accurate translation of “photobook” into Bahasa
Indonesia should be *buku foto* rather than* buku fotografi* because the latter can
be taken to mean a book about photography. *Buku foto*, on the other hand,
should be a publication that uses photography to deliver its content. Ahmad
sounds pedantic only because he feels that Indonesians have historically been
far too lax in using translated words and ideas.[^22] 

Meanwhile, there are many pre-existing terms in Southeast Asia, which
precede the current photobook hype, some of which remain relevant
today. In Mandarin, for instance, the formal term for a book, *tushu* [图
书], comprises the characters for “picture” and “book”, which already
conveys the idea of a picture or an illustrated book. According to China
photo historian Gu Zheng, in the present context “*tushu* has at least three
denotations – a book of text, of images, or both – whereas an alternate
term, *huace* [画册], refers more narrowly to a picture album composed of ink
paintings, drawings, or other illustrations”.[^23]

In other words, the terms *tushu* and *huace* already embody the myriad of
possibilities that such a publication may offer, which is not necessarily
conveyed through the somewhat prosaic nomenclature of the photobook.
This quick consideration of the Mandarin term for the photobook is
relevant for Southeast Asia, as many of the early photobooks published
in the region since 1945 had been produced by Mandarin-speaking
practitioners (or made for Chinese readers). The term *huace* is used to refer
to some of these publications, such as *The People and the Country* (《人民与
国家》). This is a modest, saddle-stitched photobook produced by the
Tanjong Pagar Branch of the People’s Action Party (PAP) in 1972, which
visualises the evolution of the party branch as the national history of
Singapore.[^24] Another common term in Chinese is *tekan* [特刊], or “special
issue”. While most people associate *kan* with the term “periodical”, it can
also mean “publication”. In Southeast Asia, news companies, Chinese
schools and political parties, among others, have published numerous
*tekan*, some of which are sumptuously illustrated with photographs,
commemorating milestone events.

In the Thai language, *nangsue phapthai* [หนังสือ ภาพถ่าย] is a somewhat
literal translation of the term “photobook”.[^25] It is a relatively new term that
can already be found in the Thai dictionary.[^26] *Phapthai* and *nangsue* refer
to “photographs” and “book” respectively. On the other hand, a term like
*samut phap* [สมุดภาพ] was already in use during the reign of Rama V
(r. 1868–1910). *Samut* means “book” while *phap* refers, more broadly, to
“illustrations”. In a way, *phap* is similar to the Chinese term *tu* [图]. In other
words, *samut phap* can be used to refer to a book of drawings, paintings or
photographs. Other terms in use since the reign of Rama V include อัลบ้มั
[pronounced as *album*] and *pramuan phap* [ประมวลภาพ]. In the 1970s, for
instance, photobooks published to record the popular political movements
of 1973 and 1976 were known as *pramuan phap*.[^27] *Pramuan* translates to
“collection” and conveys a sense of archival in terms of putting together materials from different sources.[^28] These terms have since lapsed from
popular usage.

This quick survey of terminologies referring to the photobook points to
the longstanding practice of producing such publications in Southeast
Asia. Despite the current interest in photobooks, its transfer from the
metropole to Southeast Asia has been far from uneventful. In fact, without
the active intervention of local practitioners trying to translate and make
sense of the term “photobook” and the practice of photobook-making,
it would have hardly mattered, here in Southeast Asia, what Parr and
Badger have been trying to advocate. In this regard, the unevenness in the
appreciation and making of photobooks across different parts of the region
validates my point.

#### **Translating the Photobook: Initiatives**
In the decades that followed World War II, the state, elite class and
corporations were the major drivers of photo publications in Indonesia
(as was the case in other parts of Southeast Asia). Amateur photo clubs
also published catalogues of their exhibitions. By the mid-80s, grandiose
coffee-table books had become extremely popular, as the world’s most
famous photographers were parachuted across the archipelago in search of
“mystical, mythical Indonesia” to cash in on the “West’s surging interest
in exotic lands”.[^29] In 1992, the national news agency of Antara (founded
in 1937) decided to reopen its old office in Pasar Baru, Jakarta and convert
it into Antara Photojournalism Gallery (GFJA), perhaps the first nonprofit
space in Southeast Asia dedicated to photography. At least since the
late 1990s, GFJA has been producing brochures, exhibition catalogues,
zines and photobooks for its various initiatives. In short, without access
to wealth or patronage, a photographer would have to work with an
established publisher or exhibition space to publish a photobook. The
current spate of photobook-making on a more independent basis has
taken some time to germinate.

In 2008, with the support of German Photobook Prize, PannaFoto Institute
(established in 2006), a non-profit foundation in Indonesia that focuses on
photographic education and visual literacy, initiated a long-term relationship
with Goethe-Institut in Jakarta to mount a series of photobook exhibitions.[^30]
At the inaugural exhibition in 2008, some 100 books were on display,
outnumbering the 20 or so attendees at the opening. The exhibition had
received scant interest because, for aspiring photographers in Indonesia, the
preferred mode of validating one’s work had always been to win awards,
mount a solo show or have one’s photographs published in magazines.

In 2011, Ahmad Salman, one of PannaFoto’s founding members, set up
the public Facebook group of Buku Fotografi Indonesia (Photo Books
Indonesia) and encouraged its followers to post photographs of their
photobooks to the group. This initiative worked to crowdsource the history
of photobooks in Indonesia. The fact that people responded to Ahmad’s call
suggests that the photobook form had gained a degree of traction by then.
In that same year, photobook evangelist Markus Schaden (b. 1965, Cologne)
ran a workshop sharing his book-making methodology in Jakarta.

Beyond the PannaFoto ecology, esteemed street photographer Erik Prasetya
(b. 1958, Padang) was finally able to publish, in 2011, his first and longawaited
photobook, *Jakarta: Estetika Banal*, with the most visible bookstore
retailer in Indonesia, Kepustakaan Populer Gramedia. Funded by the Jakarta
Arts Council (DKJ), the photobook brought to fruition Erik’s unwavering
desire, over the past two decades, to photograph his adopted city of Jakarta.
The endeavour bears testament to his intent to leave behind an artefact in
the photobook form for future photographers in Indonesia. “Young people
tend to work when everything is in place – when the money is there and the
concept is ready. It’s not like that,” Erik explains. “When you shoot, you
think of doing one good essay. And when you have 10 good essays, then you
can make a book.”[^31]

In April 2012, with the support of PannaFoto, Ahmad and photojournalist
Julian Sihombing (b. 1959, Jakarta–d. 2012) initiated a series of *kumpul buku*
(book gathering) in Jakarta. The event incorporated a bazaar of new and used photobooks, book signing sessions and public forums. Visitors were
encouraged to share their photobooks during each gathering. Kumpul Buku
has since inspired similar events across Indonesia, in Surabaya, Bandung,
Solo and Yogyakarta.[^32] Over in Malaysia, on 1 May 2013, Faisal Aziz (b. 1988,
Johor) and Liyana Jaafar founded the now-dormant Photobook Club
Kuala Lumpur (PBCKL), which was partly modelled after the UK-based
Photobook Club (established in 2011 by Matt Johnston). PBCKL positioned
itself as a grassroots platform to promote and nurture discussions on the
photobook, with the explicit aim of reaching the general public, beyond
the photography community.[^33] PBCKL started with the couple’s personal
collection of books and was informed by their desire to share them with the
public. Its launch event was held at a lake garden in Selangor, featuring a
discussion on photobooks and a browsing session at the
garden’s benches.

Inspired by PBCKL and PannaFoto’s Kumpul Buku, Ridzki Noviansyah
(b. 1986, Bandar Lampung) and Tommy N. Armansyah (b. 1974,
Bandung) co-founded the Photobook Club-Jakarta in 2013. During its
most active period, the club routinely organised public forums to discuss
photobooks from around the world.[^34] On 15 and 16 November 2013,
PBCKL was invited to a *kumpul buku* in Yogyakarta where they displayed
a selection of Malaysian and Japanese books from its collection. The
following year, on 18 May 2014, PBCKL hosted Ridzki for a talk at the
Centre for Asian Photographers, Selangor, where he introduced a selection
of Indonesian photobooks to the Malaysian audience. This brief account
of photobook club initiatives helps to map the circuitous translation of
photobook hype from Europe to Malaysia and Indonesia. It is also clear
that practitioners from both countries inter-referenced the experiences of
each other in localising the interest in photobooks.

In 2012, PannaFoto decided to try its hand at self-publishing. Led by
current director and founding member Ng Swan Ti (b. 1972, Malang),
they approached the endeavour with trepidation. Like Ng, many of her
peers at PannaFoto came to photography during or after Reformasi,
which was triggered by the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997 and resulted in the fall of Suharto in 1998. Since then,
they had harboured hopes of publishing
photobooks. The main challenge was to
find a way to do so without substantial
financial support. As a first attempt,
Ng decided to play it safe and publish a
book for her husband, fellow PannaFoto
member Edy Purnomo (b.1968, Ponorogo),
“who has no worry about his prestige as
a photographer”.[^35] Ahmad and designer
Bobby Haryanto worked on the project
*pro bono*. The first print run of *Passing* was
a tentative 200 copies. After everything for
the launch had been booked PannaFoto
promptly printed another 500 copies. Their
initial uncertainty over the publication is
reflected in the comparatively small size of
the photobook, which measures 16 cm by
14 cm.

In 2013, Rony Zakaria (b. 1984, Jakarta) self published his first photobook,
*Encounters*, to a warm reception. The market success of these two
publications, with buyers largely coming from within Indonesia, helped, on
a practical level, to offset production cost and instil a sense of confidence
among local photographers to self publish their works. Since then,
PannaFoto has published Ng’s *Illusion* in 2014, Mamuk Ismuntoro’s
*Tanah Yang Hilang* in 2014 and Yoppy Pieter’s *Saujana Sumpu* in 2015.
The institute did not finance any of these photobooks. Instead, each was
financed differently – through private patronage, discounted materials or
crowd funding. Beyond PannaFoto, other independent titles that have
been published in Indonesia include Aji Susanto Anom’s *Nothing Personal*
(published in 2013 by the Solo-based collective, Srawung Photo Forum),
Arum Tresnaningtyas Dayaputri’s *Goddess of Pantura* (published in 2016),
Flock Project’s *Flock Volume 01* (published in 2016) and Tandia Bambang
Permadi’s *Coming Home* (published in 2017). While this brief account may
give the impression of a vibrant photobook publishing culture in Indonesia,
it has to be framed against the context of the country’s population of over 250 million. In this sense, the photobook community – in terms of its
producers, buyers and enthusiasts – remains extremely small.

Nevertheless, it is obvious that the ecology of photobooks in Indonesia has
become more sophisticated over the past few years. In 2014, PannaFoto
organised another photobook exhibition in Jakarta, in collaboration with
Goethe-Institut. During the event, it invited Ahmad, publisher Lans
Brahmantyo (b. 1966, Surabaya) and educator-photographer Kurniadi
Widodo (b. 1985, Medan) to curate 20 Indonesian photobooks for the
exhibition. In this way, the community in Indonesia started historicising its
photobook production.

In 2015, Aditya Pratama (b. 1983, Jakarta) and Ferry Ferdianta Ginting
(b. 1983, Bandung) established Unobtainium, an online store specialising
in photobooks. Without a physical bookstore dedicated to the photobook,
Unobtainium makes absolute sense, especially in a sprawling archipelago
like Indonesia. It started by stocking foreign books, which were hard to find
in Indonesia. A year later, they began selling Indonesian photobooks, which,
in truth, turned minimal profits. Nevertheless, Aditya feels that it is part of
Unobtainium’s responsibility to stock local books as a means to grow the
photobook community.[^36] It has also given them an edge in the international
market, with foreign collectors interested in Indonesian photobooks actively
seeking Unobtainium out. In fact, Martin Parr recently bought a stash of
Indonesian photobooks from them.

A quick comparison can be made with the situation in Thailand when
photographer Akkara Naktamna (b. 1979, Bangkok) established the Good
Art Book online store in 2015. Its intention is to encourage Thai artists to
produce their own photobooks by establishing a sales and promotion channel
that offers more favourable terms and greater visibility to practitioners
who want to self-publish. The logic of strength in numbers is at work here,
similar to Unobtainium, with Good Art Book focusing predominantly on
photobooks made by Thai practitioners. Its listing of Thai photobooks is
shorter than Unobtainium’s stock list of Indonesian photobooks, reflecting
the liveliness of photobook publishing in Indonesia. With its Thai focus,
Good Art Book receives more overseas than local orders.[^37]

According to Aditya, the market for photobooks in Indonesia has
been recalibrated in recent years. A few years back, people would buy
a photobook with the simple intention of owning one. Today’s buyers
have become more discerning. While Aditya expresses this as a cautionary
note vis-à-vis the long-term sustainability of the photobook market in
Indonesia,[^38] I feel that this is actually a healthy development in terms of
evolving the taste of local buyers in purchasing photobooks and appreciating
photography. In any case, beyond mounting an exhibition, the photobook
has become an acknowledged means among Indonesian photographers
to showcase their work. This is one of the most discernible outcomes in
translating the photobook hype in Indonesia.

This prompts us to cast a glance at the photobook ecology in the
Philippines. At first sight, the Philippines would seem primed for the
translation of the recent photobook craze. The country boasts a rising
middle-class, critical mass in terms of population, a vivacious heritage of
photographic practices, and general openness towards American trends
and information. It has had a long history of producing photobooks,
starting perhaps with Filipino photographer Felix Laureano (b. 1866,
Patnongon, Antique Province –d. 1952) who, in 1895, published the
album-book *Memories of the Philippines* in Barcelona. A cheaper facsimile
was made in 2001 in the Philippines.[^39] Short of narrating a linear history
here, it is worth pointing out that the fall of Marcos heralded a spate
of photobooks being published, including *Kasama: A Collection of
Photographs of the New People’s Army of the Philippines* (published in 1987),
which garnered the National Book Award for its photographers Alex
Baluyut (b. 1956, Manila) and Lenny Limjoco (b. 1954, Manila–d. 2012).
Other notable photobooks that followed in that period include *Depth of
Field: Photographs of Poverty*, Repression, and Struggle in the Philippines
(published in 1987), *Sipat: A Collection of Photographs from the Philippine
Collegian 1987–88* (published in 1988), Limjoco’s *Larawan: Portraits
of Filipinos* (published in 1989) and *Dwell on Their Faces, Probe Their
Thoughts: Photographs of Filipino Children* (published in 1990).

As a parallel, when Indonesian president Suharto stepped down during
the Reformasi in 1998, the lid was suddenly removed and several critical
photobooks (including exhibition catalogues) were published during that
period, including Oscar Motuloh’s satirical *Carnaval* (published in 2000)
and Eddy Hasby’s *East Timor: The Long and Winding Road* (published in
2001).[^40] On hindsight, the latter received limited interest then possibly
because the photobook form was seen as a luxury object beyond the means
of most Indonesians who were still recovering from the economic fallout
of the Reformasi. Eddy’s interest in East Timor might have also been
misinterpreted by some as a slight against Indonesia’s sovereignty. But,
as photobook-making gains traction in Indonesia, Eddy’s book has since
resurfaced as an important reference.

In the Philippines, an important publisher of critical books since the fall of
Marcos has been the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism (PCIJ),
a non-profit media agency established in 1989. While it does not have a
specific focus on photobooks, PCIJ did publish Alex Baluyut’s *Brother Hood*
in 1995, an in-depth photo story on police brutality in Manila. The book
registered record sales and won Baluyut his second National Book Award.
In 2002, PCIJ published veteran photographer Sonny Yabao’s *Memory of
Dances*, which examines, through his enigmatic photographs, the story of
cultural loss experienced by the Bugkalot and Igorot at Nueva Vizcaya, the
Tagbanua at Coron and the Manobo at Mount Apo.[^41]

Sheila S. Coronel (b. 1958), one of Asia’s most eminent investigative
journalists, served as PCIJ’s executive director from 1989 to 2006. Apart
from the freedom heralded by the post-Marcos era, Coronel notes that the
economy had improved significantly enough for people to start buying
books, fuelling even the publication of expensive coffee table books during
the 1990s. In PCIJ’s remit, photography remains integral to many of its
publications because the medium is essential to the documentation of
wrongdoing, such as police abuses or corruption in procurement and
public works, while lending credibility and humanity to its investigative
work.[^42] While photography took centre stage in *Brother Hood and Memory
of Dances*, Coronel admits that the production value for both photobooks
was deliberately modest in order to keep costs low, so as to make them more
affordable and extend their reach. In fact, she suspects that buyers of both
photobooks mainly came from beyond the photography community.[^43]

Since the valorisation of the photobook by Parr and Badger, there have
been attempts to translate that interest to Manila. In 2015, contemporary
artist Wawi Navarroza (b. 1979, Manila) established Thousandfold, which
featured a public photobook library and the Thousandfold Small Press, an
initiative to encourage Filipino practitioners to make small-edition photo
publications. Thousandfold also initiated the Photobook Club Manila
in 2015. Some of these initiatives were cut short due to a fire in 2016 that
destroyed Navarroza’s studio.

In 2017, Filipino photographer-printer RJ Fernandez (b. 1979, Manila)
officially established MAPA Books, an independent publishing house in
London. Predictably, its first photobook titles are dedicated to two Filipino
photographers: Tommy Hafalla’s *Ili* (published in 2016)[^44] and Veejay
Villafranca’s *Signos* (published in 2017). Informed by Fernandez’s desire to
bring the quality of production in London to the Philippines, and given that
MAPA Books prints their titles in Italy, the pricing of these photobooks is
at a similar level to that of a European publication.[^45] Thus, it remains to be
seen whether the price-point of both publications will hinder their broader
reception in Manila.

In Java, it is clear that the photography community has become invested
in the photobook form. Their support in terms of interest and purchases
directly fuels the photobook ecology in Indonesia.[^46] While they may have
differing views on the medium, senior photographers remain active as
role models, mediating the relevance of photobooks in local terms. There
have also been initiatives to promote the photobook among Filipino
practitioners. They are typically short-lived or one-off endeavours,
taking the form of a photobook exhibition or a booth at the art fair. The
unglamorous and long-term work of creating a community invested in the
photobook has not been taken up, unlike the interventions of PannaFoto
Institute or GFJA in Indonesia. Some of the senior photographers have
also faded from the scene, with the likes of Baluyut and Yabao moving out
of Manila and relocating to Laguna.

An attempt by Photobook Club Manila in 2017 to replicate Buku Fotografi
Indonesia’s initiative to crowdsource the history of Philippine photobooks (via its Facebook group) also fizzled out before it could gain any traction. There
seems to be a defeatist sentiment in the Filipino photography scene. This is
most evident when a senior photographer, somewhat exasperated, said that she
is simply too broke to make a photobook, as though the modest movement of
independent photobook publishing across Java has been undertaken only by
the privileged class. This is far from the truth. When Ng Swan Ti decided to
set the first print run of Edy Purnomo’s *Passing* at 200 copies, it was based on
the calculation that they would be able to coerce at least 200 of their friends
to support the project.[^47] Is it impossible to garner similar support for an
accomplished Filipino photographer in Manila? I have no idea. Nevertheless,
it is obvious that Manila lacks respected interlocutors who have a sustained
commitment in translating the photobook interest and making it relevant to
local practitioners. While it is certainly useful to learn about the production of
photobooks in Europe and America, the experiences of practitioners in Java
may be of greater relevance to those in Manila.

#### **An Evolving Typology of Photobooks in Southeast Asia**
Instead of proposing a catchall definition for the Southeast Asian
photobook, I offer here an evolving typology of such publications based
on the NLB collections. This typology is largely derived from the function
and intent of each photobook, with its content a secondary consideration.
I propose this typology, not because I wish to create another system to
pigeonhole a particular publication. This typology will only be productive
if it is thought of as a mapping of photobook experiences in Southeast Asia
since 1945. The typology should help us think of the kinds of photobooks
that have been produced under specific desires and conditions across the
region. In this way, the desires and conditions that inform the making
of a particular kind of photobook can then be compared to the situation
elsewhere, beyond Southeast Asia. It is true that a particular title can be
placed under several categories. Ideally, this should open up different ways
of reading a particular photobook.

There is a degree of tentativeness in proposing this typology, given the
way NLB catalogues and organises its collections, as highlighted earlier
in the essay. As and when a photobook that complicates this typology is
encountered, it will become necessary to include a new type.

These are the types of photobooks:<br>
 1. Photobooks as Performing State Politics<br>
 2. Photobooks as Repository of Marginalised Politics<br>
 3. Exhibition Catalogues<br>
 4. Photobooks as Portfolio/Exhibition<br>
 5. Corporate Books as Photobooks<br>
 6. Minjian (民间) Books as Photobooks<br>
 7. Scenes and Landscapes: Photobooks as Record<br><br>
Let me explain the typology in greater detail.

***1. Photobooks as Performing State Politics***
Given the cost of producing a photobook, the state has always been a major
publisher of books with significant photographic content. Photography is
seen as an efficient way to convey the state’s agenda, especially when the
intended audience is deemed to be an unwilling reader of text. In this sense,
*The People and the Country* (《人民与国家》) and *Viet Nam in Flames* can be
thought of as photobooks that perform state politics. While the latter was
intended for an English-speaking audience, presumably located outside
of South Vietnam, *The People and the Country* was meant for domestic
consumption, especially among Singapore’s Chinese-reading population.

While the state might understandably be invested in advancing its agenda
through photobooks, it is worth noting that there have also been numerous
photo publications, credited to photographers and commercial publishers,
which willingly mirror the state narrative. Quite a number feature the works
of foreign photographers. A good example is *The Royal Family of Thailand*,
authored and photographed by London-based Jewish photographer
Reginald Davis.[^48] A fellow of the Royal Photographic Society (RPS) of Great
Britain since 1971, Davis made a name for himself photographing royal
families across the world. While the photobook was published in London
in 1981, it was printed and bound by Dai Nippon’s Hong Kong office. The
Japanese printing house had established its Hong Kong branch in 1964,
bringing its services one step closer to Southeast Asia.

Published in English, *The Royal Family of Thailand* was distributed by
Central Department Store, a retail giant from Bangkok. While this suggests that the English-reading public in Thailand would have reasonable access to
the photobook, it is likely that the publication would have been of interest
to readers beyond the country. The blurb on the front flap of the dust jacket
states: “In an age of turmoil in South-East Asia, the constitutional monarchy
of Thailand, situated as it is in a sub-continent of intensive political
change, has variously excited outside observers with bafflement, curiosity
and respect. How can such a kingdom flourish, the world asks, how can it
even survive such an environment?” The turmoil of the region mentioned
here probably refers to the October 1973 uprising and the 6 October 1976
massacre in Bangkok, the fall of Saigon in 1975, the takeover of Cambodia
by the Khmer Rouge and its subsequent dispersal in 1979 by Vietnamese
forces, as well as the Communist-turn in Laos.

The Thai kingdom’s stability then, as spelt out by the book’s blurb, was
only guaranteed by the “extraordinary power of the good exercised by Their
Majesties King Bhumipol and Queen Sirikit over the Thai people”. The
photographs subsequently show the royal family decked in regalia, traversing
the country and visiting their subjects. More crucially, readers are afforded
a glimpse of the royal family in scenes of leisure and pleasure, reminiscent
of the colourful fashion spreads of that era. Davis’ photographs appear in
contrast to the turmoil referenced in the blurb. The circulation of Davis’
photobook through the English-speaking milieu helped to popularise the
perception that the well being of the Thai nation was inevitably pegged to
the steady hands of the royal family.

***2. Photobooks as Repository of Marginalised Politics***
The second kind of photobook can be thought of as publications produced
in partial response to the previous type of photobook. Broadly speaking,
these photobooks use the book format to record, recall and visualise other
articulations of politics that have been made marginal by the state or
mainstream society. They are sometimes, though not always, produced by civil
society. For instance, *Labour Party of Malaya Album of Historical Photographs*
(《马来亚劳工党历史图片集》) was published by surviving members of the
political party in 2000, decades after its deregistration in 1972.[^49]

<img src="/images/COA%202017%20to%202018/Southeast%20Asian%20Photobooks/Labour_Party_of_Malaya_5.jpg" style="width:100%;">
 <div style="background-color: white;"> Labour Party of Malaya album of historical photographs (2000). Softcover, 21.8 x 29 cm, 184 pages. <i> Image source:
马来亚劳工党历史图片集 [Labour Party of Malaya album of historical
photographs]. (2000). 吉隆坡：劳工党党史全国工委会. pp. 154–155 (Call no.: Chinese RSING 324.259507 MLY-[YOS])</i></div>

The Labour Party of Malaya (LPM) originated from an amalgamation of
different labour parties across Malaya in 1952, and gained control of the
George Town Municipal Council during the Penang municipal council
elections of December 1956. In the 1959 General Election, under the
Socialist Front (SF) coalition, LPM won six parliamentary seats and 13 seats
in different state assemblies. Internal disagreements over the formation of
Malaysia in 1963, waves of arrests without trial targeting many LPM cadres
under the Internal Security Act (ISA) and the party’s eventual decision to
boycott parliament gradually brought about its demise.[^50]

In its introduction, editor’s foreword and afterword, the fact that LPM
members risked potential state reprisal to preserve these images for posterity
is repeatedly mentioned or implied. The afterword notes the publication’s
aim to “reflect the real side of Malayan history” through these historical
photographs. While the photobook focuses on the milestones of LPM, the
latter sections strive to visualise the state violence enacted on its comrades
and their family members. To heighten the visual drama of the forceful
dispersals of family members outside a detention camp, a strategy of montage and juxtaposition is used, recalling the graphic nature of protest
books from across the region.[^51] Portraits of former LPM and SF detainees,
neatly laid out in a grid, run for nine pages in the closing section of the
photobook, a reminder of their sacrifices for Malaysia.[^52]

***3. Exhibition Catalogues***

The cost of producing photobooks remains exorbitant for most
photographers in Southeast Asia. Publications made in conjunction with
exhibitions, published or partially subsidised by the exhibiting venue, offers
an opportunity for practitioners to produce photobooks. While some of
these publications provide nothing more than a listing of exhibited works,
others are well designed and offer a narrative or political reading that is not
limited to the content of the printed photographs.

In the decades following the end of World War II, as the nations in
Southeast Asia broke away from colonialism, a particular kind of exhibition
catalogue abounded – those produced by amateur photo clubs. As advocates
of Pictorialism or salon photography, these clubs offered tutelage to eager
adherents interested in learning the medium, prior to the institutionalisation
of photo education in academies and universities across the region.[^53] They
operated through the logic of strength in numbers and typically enjoyed
patronage, directly or otherwise, from the state or elite class. An example is
*Pictorial Photography: Seven Men Photo Exhibition*, an exhibition catalogue
published by the Photographic Society of Singapore (PSS) in 1965.[^54] The PSS
originated from the Singapore Camera Club, which was established in 1950
under the British-backed Singapore Art Society umbrella. Police inspector
Yee Joon Toh served as its founding president. Since its inception, the club
has published numerous catalogues for its exhibitions and competitions.
Many of these catalogues are forgettable, with a few exceptions, including
*Pictorial Photography: Seven Men Photo Exhibition*, which was published
in conjunction with a group exhibition at Victoria Memorial Hall. The
exhibition featured the works of seven Chinese male photographers active
in the milieu of salon photography, namely: Lee Lim, Mun Chor Koon, Tan Boon Yean, Wang Su Fah, Wu Peng Seng, Yam Pak Nin and Yip
Cheong Fun (b. 1903, Hong Kong–d. 1989, Singapore).

Then Minister for Culture S. Rajaratnam officiated the opening of the
exhibition on 5 March 1965. In the catalogue’s foreword, Rajaratnam wrote,
just months before Singapore was ousted from Malaysia, “Photography is an
art form which cuts across barriers of language, race and creed. In our multiracial
society it is an effective and essential method of communication to
promote better understanding amongst the various communities of our new
nation. … In the not too distant past, it was not uncommon for Singapore
to be dismissed as ‘a cultural desert’, but it is gratifying to note that world
opinion has changed completely, thanks to the efforts and diligence of our
people and organisations such as yours [PSS] which have focused attention
on our cultural life”.[^55]

An important aide to Lee Kuan Yew in the PAP, Rajaratnam’s words held
sway in terms of the way photography would be mobilised for the party’s
agenda and to mark Singapore’s relevance to the world. It is likely that Chua
Soo Bin (b. 1932, Singapore) helped to produce or design the thoughtful
catalogue.[^56] Chua had started out as a PSS member whose practice would
eventually evolve to encompass advertising and portraiture. In 1988, Chua
was conferred the Cultural Medallion (Photography), the highest award for
the arts in Singapore.

The dust jacket of *Pictorial Photography: Seven Men Photo Exhibition*
presents a group portrait of the featured photographers staring at the camera
and the intended viewers of this publication. The end-paper of the book
presents the negative image of this group portrait. A crop of the portrait
reappears in the photobook, above the spread listing the featured works.
This interplay of positive and negative images articulates the designer’s keen
awareness of the photographic process and helps to project, through the
photographers’ unwavering gaze (at the viewers), their modernist profile as
art photographers. Echoing the title of the photobook, the numeral seven
is repeated in the opening spread of each photographer’s chapter of his
works. As a whole, the design of the catalogue exudes confidence that seems
befitting of that era and the status of the exhibiting photographers.


***4. Photobooks as Portfolio/Exhibition***

Earlier, I argued that it is important to re-contextualise certain exhibition
catalogues as potential photobooks. Here, the focus is on photobooks
that are conceived as an exhibition or portfolio of the practitioner’s
work. In certain cases, these photobooks function as a manifesto of the
photographer’s practice. It is also possible to place the artist’s book in
this section. In this way, the collaboration between artist Robert Zhao
(b. 1983, Singapore) and designer Hanson Ho, resulting in publications
such as *Mynas*,[^57] can be placed in dialogue with salon photographer
Chua Tiag Ming’s *Photography in Action* (《哲民影集》).[^58]

While Zhao’s photobook feels sumptuous and very designed, which
transforms his work into a tactile experience, Chua’s book, designed
by fellow salon photographer Foo Tee Jun, seems almost unadorned.
The front end-paper features a picture of Chua prone on the ground,
photographing a lady (whom I presume to be his wife, given that
his dedication to her appears in the top left corner). Chua’s wife had
apparently also contributed to the photobook by touching up the
photographs and proofreading the English text.[^59] On one hand, Chua’s
photobook looks like a portfolio of his best hits. The accompanying
captions oscillate between providing context to the images, articulating his
perspectives on the subject matter, and delving into the technical issues
of a particular photograph. On the other hand, the book also features text
by other esteemed salon practitioners on various aspects of photography.
Hence, Chua’s photobook feels like a hybrid object that serves as a
portfolio, manual for other photographers, as well as a vehicle to express
his thoughts.


***5. Corporate Books as Photobooks***

Corporations have always sought out and commissioned the best
photographers for their book projects. This is another avenue where we
may encounter exemplars of photobooks in Southeast Asia. One curious
example from NLB’s collections that merits a quick mention is *Brunei Darus
Salam: A Pictorial Review of the Land and People*, published by Brunei Shell Petroleum Company.[^60] At first glance, this photobook published in 1968
was to commemorate the coronation of Hassanal Bolkiah, the current sultan
and prime minister of Brunei. The photobook takes us through the ways-oflife
and development of the state, with the closing section dedicated to the
extraction of oil, the *raison d’être* for Shell’s existence in Brunei. Within my
proposed typology, this publication can be thought of as a photobook that
performs state politics. However, it is also a corporate book published by the
oil company to portray Brunei, on behalf of the state, which only attained
independence from the United Kingdom in 1984. Locating this publication
in this category allows us to consider the intricate connection between the
oil conglomerate and logic of political power in Brunei.

***6. Minjian (民间) Books as Photobooks***

In Southeast Asia, another source of photobooks comes from the *minjian*
(民间). As Taiwanese theorist Chen Kuan-Hsing points out, *minjian* refers
to “a folk, people’s, or commoners’ society, but not exactly – because while
min means people or populace, *jian* connotes space and in-betweenness”.[^61]
In short, *minjian* refers to the “space where traditions are maintained as
resources to help common people survive the violent rupture brought about
by the modernising of state and civil society”. The examples of *minjian*
groups that Chen gives include religious sects, sex workers and street
vendors.[^62] It is also possible to think of the Chinese-medium schools in
Malaysia and Cambodia, self-help groups and clan associations across the
region, as well as certain cultural organisations (such as KUNCI Cultural
Studies Centre at Yogyakarta, Lostgens’ Contempoary Art Space at Kuala
Lumpur and Bras Basah Open in Singapore) as different manifestations
of the *minjian* society in Southeast Asia. While the term *minjian* is not as
commonly used in Southeast Asia as compared to Taiwan (where Chen
is based), a semblance of the *minjian* that Chen evokes continues to exist
across Southeast Asia.

For the purpose of discussion, a publication such as *A Pictorial History of
Hin Hua High School* can be considered a *minjian* photobook.[^63] Founded
in 1947 and funded partially through *minjian* society, Hin Hua is a Chinese
independent school in Klang, Malaysia. This 364-page photobook is part
of a three-volume publication that commemorates the arduous journey
Hin Hua High School has undertaken to provide education in Klang. The
publication’s intention is to record the sacrifices of its founders, tying the
photobook to the Chinese cultural tradition and placing it within the context
of the marginalisation of Chinese experiences within the national history of
Malaysia.[^64] In this way, this photobook has been bestowed with a burden
larger than just the recording of Hin Hua’s development over the decades.

Printed on an understated yet elegant paper stock, the publication features
a wonderful selection of historic and recent photographs, juxtaposed
against archival materials and news reports relating to Hin Hua High
School. The layout is an attempt to translate the viewing experience of a
physical exhibition into the book format. Interestingly, the designer of
the book is TsuJi Lam, a founding member of Lostgens’ *Contemporary
Art Space*. Despite its name, Lostgens’ is actually more of a *minjian* space-collective
facilitating initiatives in art, politics, heritage and culture. Over
the years, it has intervened in community sites that have come under
the threat of gentrification and destruction. In these interventions, one
of its key initiatives has been the collection of oral history interviews
and old photographs from members of the affected communities. These
photographs are then displayed onsite, perhaps in a disused shop lot or
*kopitiam* (coffeeshop), as a means to generate discussions. Very often, the
photographs serve as an additional trigger for other community members to
come forward, hence crowdsourcing a *minjian* history of the affected sites.
Lam’s involvement in these initiatives can be perceived as a parallel to her
design work in *A Pictorial History of Hin Hua High School*.

***7. Scenes and Landscapes: Photobooks as Record***

Prior to the proliferation of television sets and budget travel, periodicals and
photobooks helped to bring views of the world to eager audiences across
Southeast Asia. In some cases, these publications helped Southeast Asians experience the formation and boundaries of the nations to which they
pledged allegiance by bringing them sights and landscapes from these newlyformed
states. In other instances, they brought – and continue to bring – us
views from faraway places. Some of these photobooks might have been made
to mirror the state agenda. But the ethos of time has somewhat tempered
their political motivations, rendering these publications as records from a
different time and place.

An obvious example is *Characters of Light: A Guide to the Buildings of
Singapore*, written and photographed by Marjorie Doggett (b. 1921, Sussex,
UK–d. 2010, Singapore).[^65] Writer, publisher, gallery owner and impresario
Donald Moore (b. 1923, Leicestershire, UK–d. 2000) was responsible
for putting out *Characters of Light* in 1957. Doggett and Moore arrived
in Singapore through the colonial milieu – the Royal Air Force posted
Doggett’s husband to the island in 1947, while Moore arrived that same year
to work for British publishing houses. The opening section of Doggett’s
book features a verse penned by Sir Stamford Raffles, which reads: “Let it
still be the boast of Britain to write her name in characters of light; let her
not be remembered as the tempest whose course was desolation, but as the
gale of spring reviving the slumbering seeds of mind and calling them to life
from the winter of ignorance and oppression. If the time shall come when
her empire shall have passed away, these monuments will endure when her
triumphs shall have become an empty name.”

Doggett wrote in the foreword that her book made “no pretence to be
a technical work on Colonial architecture”.[^66] In the short history of
Singapore that follows the foreword, the narrative of Singapore’s evolution
from a mangrove swamp to a great port, a development “beyond Raffles’
wildest dreams”, is predictably repeated, with no mention of Britain’s
exploitation of Malaya before and after World War II.[^67] While it is
doubtful that the photobook was ostensibly made to perform the colonial
state’s politics, Doggett’s straight-up and considered recording of colonial
buildings, riverside godowns, elegant mosques and elaborate temples
should be seen as a tacit acknowledgement (and visualisation) of the
flourishing of Singapore through British colonialism.

In 1960, the Doggetts became Singapore citizens. In 1985, Times Books
International made a flimsy reproduction of the original book, with
a different sequence of photographs and the addition of previously
unpublished images.[^68] The new foreword explained that the rationale
for the reproduction was nostalgia for old Singapore and Doggett’s plea
for heritage conservation. After accounting for the fact that a newly
independent nation would have little interest in the colonial past, Doggett
wrote: “But time has its mellowing effect. History is always a mixture, and
whether good or evil prevails for a time, each period has its place in the
making of a nation”.[^69] Indeed, Doggett’s photographs come to us today
with their colonial imprint somewhat withered, only to be detected in the
young nation’s nostalgia for its distant past.

#### **Conclusion**
In closing, this essay has offered a tentative overview of our photobookmaking
experiences in Southeast Asia, based on NLB’s collections. It
is also clear that much work remains to be done. Our knowledge of
photobooks published in *chu~’
quô´c ngu~’*
or the Thai language, for instance,
remains limited. Furthermore, despite the years of upheaval that countries
like Cambodia and Myanmar have experienced in the recent past, it is
problematic to assume that photobook-making had been halted simply
because of that. The typology that I have proposed should help us broaden
the scope in terms of locating and defining our photobook experiences in
the region. To this end, it is also an evolving typology that invites further
scrutiny. Finally, photobooks should not be studied only in relation to the
history of photography in Southeast Asia. In fact, future reseachers would
be able to cast a different light when considering our photobook experiences
through the perspectives of design history, evolution of print technology and
the routes of distribution (of materials needed to make photobooks and how
they are being sold across the world).

<b>Zhuang Wubin</b> is a writer, curator and artist. As a writer and curator, Zhuang focuses
on the photographic practices of Southeast Asia and Hong Kong. He uses the medium
as a prism to explore trajectories such as photography and Chineseness; periodicals and
photobooks as sites of historiography; and photography’s entanglements with nationalism
and the Cold War. Zhuang has written several books and has recently published
Photography in Southeast Asia: A Survey (NUS Press, 2016) and Shifting Currents:
Glimpses of a Changing Nation (NLB, 2018). As an artist, Zhuang uses photography
and text to visualise the shifting experiences of Chineseness in Southeast Asia.</div>
