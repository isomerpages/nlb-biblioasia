#### **Introduction**
It did not take long for the London Missionary Society (LMS ) to arrive in
Singapore after Stamford Raffles of the British East India Company signed
a treaty with Sultan Hussein Mahmud Shah on 6 February 1819 to establish
a trading post on the island. The first missionary arrived a few months later,
on 18 October 1819. Samuel Milton set up a mission house on Bras Basah
Road and was subsequently joined in 1822 by Claudius Henry Thomsen,
who had transferred from the mission in Malacca.

Raffles had already had contact with the LMS missionaries in Malacca,
describing Reverend William Milne as “a liberal, well-informed, excellent
man”.1 He thought less of several other missionaries he had met there and,
presumably questioning their effectiveness, wrote, “Had I been a Missionary
myself I think I could have evangelised the whole island by this time.”2 He
was nonetheless interested in their printing presses, seeing the potential of
the presses for secular use. He engaged the LMS missionaries in Singapore
to print his first proclamations – 50 copies in English and 50 copies in
Malay. Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir, who had been Raffles’ Malay teacher, secretary and interpreter, was now working with the missionaries and
described the laborious process and the pressure they were under:

   *For two days I sat making types… At last at three o’clock in the<br> 
   morning all was finished, for the same morning, which was the<br> 
   first day of the new year, they wanted to publish the laws. Work<br> 
   went on and on and the perspiration poured off us. Eyes drooped<br> 
   and stomachs felt the pangs of hunger, all because the task had to<br> 
   be finished that night. For Mr. Raffles had insisted that it be ready<br> 
   by the next morning. And the next morning the notices were posted<br> 
   in every quarter of the town*.3

By February 1823, Thomsen had written to London noting that “we are now
printing in English &amp; Malay &amp; have a small Type-Foundery &amp; are doing
bookbinding. Government has been pleased to honour our little Press…
with printing all public Documents both in English and Malay.”4

In this early entanglement of Empire and religion, I would like to explore
the motivations of these missionary printers, the challenges they faced and
their contributions to early printing in Singapore. What brought them from
Britain to the other side of the world? And what did they achieve?

#### **On a Mission**
The last years of the 18th century saw a surge of evangelical Protestant
revival in Britain. This was triggered by a range of complex social and
economic changes, which included the rise of a comfortable middle class
with money to spend on charity and good works; an aspiring working
class with a desire for self-improvement through adult education; and the
expansion of commerce and influence abroad, largely through the growing
markets of the British East India Company.

The successful expeditions of Captain James Cook to the Pacific added to
this sense of economic expansion at home and abroad, and, for Christian
evangelists, an optimism about the possibilities of spreading the gospel to far-flung lands – particularly urgent for those who believed in a forthcoming
millennium when Christ would return to earth and all would be judged.
Several missionary societies, set up to send forth Christian missionaries,
were formed within a few years of one another – the Baptist Missionary
Society in 1792, the London Missionary Society in 1795, the Church
Missionary Society in 1799 and the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society
in 1813.5

The public meeting held in September 1795 to formally establish the LMS
attracted such fanfare that many people started arriving an hour before the
appointed time, and thousands more had to be turned away.6 Most were
from non-conformist or dissenting churches, believing in a simple style
of worship based on the scriptures. They had come to hear about plans to
spread Christianity “among heathen and other unenlightened nations”.7

It is easy to read these words today as evidence of a sense of racial
or cultural superiority. Yet we need to understand them through the
evangelical prism of the time, bound up with the belief of salvation – that
is, only those who believed in Christ could be “saved” and go to Heaven.
Thus the duty of the evangelical Christian was to spread the gospel widely
across nations, so that as many souls as possible might be saved. As one
preacher put it, “Ye were once pagans, living in cruel and abominable
idolatry. The servants of Jesus came from other lands… And ought you
not… to send messengers to the nations which are in like conditions to
yourselves of old.”8

Another preached that:

   *Possessing, as they do, the same feelings of nature as ourselves,<br> 
   the same moral wants, the same faculties of improvement, the<br> 
   same dread of misery, the same desire of happiness, and the same<br> 
   capacity of enjoyment, ought we not zealously to endeavour that<br> 
   they may also become partakers of like precious faith with us, and<br> 
   sharers in the same common salvation*.9

While some individuals might have felt themselves racially superior, the
evangelical doctrine was egalitarian in the belief that the gospel could save
*all* who embraced it. Brian Stanley has argued that:

   *For most of the nineteenth century, if the missionary movement can<br> 
   be accused of racism, the racism was of a “soft” kind. It was based,<br> 
   not on any notion of permanent biological inequality between<br> 
   races, but on obstinately deep-rooted convictions about differences<br> 
   between “civilized” and “uncivilized” peoples, which were<br> 
   explained in terms of a causal connection between Christianity<br> 
   and the regenerative process of “civilization”*.10
