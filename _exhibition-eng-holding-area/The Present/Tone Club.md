**About**:	Tone Club is primarily composed of new immigrant communities who are actively engaged in integrating into local Singaporean culture whilst maintaining their own cultural identities and perspectives. The organisation focuses on conducting reading exchanges and cultural activities across several key areas, including arts and literature, personal spiritual growth, and cross-cultural dialogue. The reading club is characterised by its vibrant and intellectually stimulating atmosphere, where members engage in thoughtful discussions that reflect both analytical rigour and genuine curiosity.
