<div style="background-color: white;">During the Occupation years, Japanese companies controlled the wealth in Singapore and Malaya. The Japanese claimed that this would bring about co-prosperity by ensuring an even distribution of goods among the population regardless of race. <i>All rights reserved, Liu, K. (1946).

The horrors of the Japanese Occupation (1942–45) in Singapore can be read in any number of history books. But few are likely to be as visceral as a series of cartoon books published after World War II in 1946. Titled *Chop Suey*, the four volumes of illustrations by the artist Liu Kang offer a rare insight into how people in Singapore were persecuted and tortured by the Japanese during the Occupation years.

When Singapore fell to Japan on 15 February 1942, the Chinese community suffered the greatest backlash when Chinese males aged between 18 and 59 were singled out for mass executions by the Japanese military. Operation Sook Ching (the Chinese term means “purge through cleansing”) was an opportunity for the Japanese to rid Singapore of its anti-Japanese elements and seek vengeance on local Chinese who had supported the boycott of Japanese goods and provided financial support to the Chinese government during the bitter second Sino-Japanese War in 1937.1

The Japanese Occupation was a significant period in Singapore’s history. One result of these common experiences was a heightened awareness of nationalism 
in Southeast Asia, which played a role in making the idea of independence attractive to many people after the war. Beyond the surface value of Liu Kang’s work, what it 
represents as a poignant record of wartime memories had far reaching consequences on post-war bilateral relations between Singapore and Japan.2

The cartoon books – three in English, and one in Chinese – were quickly forgotten in the post-war years, but later gained prominence in the 1980s after they were re-discovered and publicly exhibited by the National Archives and the National Library. The sketches were used in 1984 as part of Singapore’s national education programme.3Subsequently, in 1986, two of the Chop Suey volumes were displayed at the National Library as part of its Heritage Week event.4
