####  Lee Kong Chian Research Fellow _Desmond Wee_ ponders the Singaporean identity while being a tourist in Singapore.

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*"To tourists around the world over, the Merlion is the <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;tourism symbol of Singapore. To the architects of <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;independent Singapore, it is the story of a concept that <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;worked. To the travel industry, it is a souvenir spinner <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;and an icon that helps to sell Singapore overseas."* <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Pamelia Lee (2004: 99)

It struck me when the Merlion was struck, more by the discourses around it than the stroke of lightning that bore a hole in its skull. Forty-five years after its creation, I wonder about the Merlion as an emblem for the Singapore Tourism Board (STB), how Singaporean Fraser Brunner felt when he conceptualised the animal and if that mattered at all. According to the Report of the Tourism Task Force 1984 (in Schoppert 2005: 25), “what Singapore suffers from is an identity problem as there is no landmark or monument which a tourist can easily associate Singapore with”. In a paper for a course “Questioning Evolution and Progress” at the National University of Singapore, Devan (2006: 4) related the issue, rather than being about “how tourists identify Singaporeans” it was about the Singaporean “struggle for an identity”.

However, the complexities of identity acquisition cannot elude how tourists identify Singaporeans. As described by Lanfant, Allcock & Bruner (1995: ix), it is tourism which “compels local societies to become aware and to question the identities they offer to foreigners as well as the prior images that are imposed upon them.” Representations in this sense are not only constituted by embodied practices, but they also constitute the ways in which identities are performed. By the same token, Singaporeans identify tourists as much as tourists identify Singaporeans, and in asking how Singaporeans identify themselves in the fostering of identity, I also ask if it is possible for Singaporeans to identify themselves as *tourists*. Who is the Singaporean under the Merlion?

Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew once remarked that economic progress must not undermine the “heartware of Singapore” referring to “our love for the country, our rootedness and our sense of community and nationhood” (*The Straits Times*, 20 October 1997). The cultivation of identity, as a need and means of survival, has evolved into a “substantial injection of selfdefinition and national pride” (Chua & Kuo 1990: 6). However, given the birth of active citizenry, contestations across and in between *routes* pertaining to the definition of self come to the fore. Kellner (1992) has suggested the emergence of identity as a “freely chosen game” in a “theatrical presentation of the self”. In this sense, our rootedness is also our “routedness”, a play in which identities are constituted within and not outside representation, and “relate to the invention of tradition as much as to tradition itself…” (Hall 1996: 4). Instead of the “so-called return to roots”, Hall (1996: 4) advocates a “coming-to-termswith our ‘routes’” with which we can relate to cultural identities as fluid and emergent rather than being static. In the same way, Crouch, Aronsson and Wahlström (2001) maintain that the consideration of place and its represented culture “through encounter as ‘routes’ suggests a much less stable and fixed experienced geography”. This framing of text in terms of a becoming of identity repositions the performance of self as “the changing same” (Gilroy 1994) and discusses the myriad ways in which knowledge and performances based on their representations are being (re)produced.
