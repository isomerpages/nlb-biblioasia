Singapore once abounded with *keramat* that ranged from sturdy structures, such as the Keramat Iskandar Shah* at Fort Canning, to simple roadside shrines, such as the vanished Orang Halus* *keramat* at the Havelock Road Police Station.  Sadly, most of these *keramat* were demolished over the past half century to make way for development. The most recent of these demolitions, Keramat Siti Mariam in Kallang*, was followed by an exhibition at the National University of Singapore’s museum in 2011, but most of the demolitions were carried out without much notice.

*Keramat* represent physical markers of Singapore’s history as a maritime trading centre, yet they are also focal points for the communities in which they stood, offering a sanctified space where people could seek solace or ask for dispensation or intervention in personal problems. Maintained by self-appointed caretakers, each *keramat* has folklore that interweaves historical facts with a syncretic spirituality mirroring the sensibilities of the community.

This paper will offer a brief of analysis of the various types of keramat that were once found across Singapore, including *keramat hidup* or living *keramat*, *datuk keramat*, grave-shrines or shrines that resemble graves, and authentic graves. It concludes by examining how, for instance as vernacular culture, *keramat* often have fraught relationships with authority, both religious and secular.        

#### **What’s a Keramat?**
*Keramat* are sacred objects that possess a special energy known as *semangat*. These may be natural objects like trees, rocks, termite mounds, whirlpools, waterfalls; living animals; living people; graves of *wali* or venerated persons; old graves of unknown origin; spirits of animals or holy men; or a combination thereof. 

Each *kerama*t is unique, yet different ethnic groups may have varying perspectives on a single *kerama*t. It was common for a *keramat* to have multiple identities: names, ages, origins, and even genders could change over time. 

However, some *keramat* have maintained relatively stable identities over the decades. It is perhaps not a coincidence that most of these tend to be the *keramat* that still exist, for instance, Habib Nuh*, Iskandar Shah, Radin Mas* and Tok Lasam*.

While the *keramat* tradition is rooted in the Islamic culture of the region, the relationship between *keramat* and Islam is complex. Some modern Muslims are regular devotees at *keramat*, while others consider them to be idolatrous. The belief of most Muslims I spoke with falls somewhere between these two polarities. 

In the simplest sense, *keramat* are grounded in a localised version of Islam that incorporates Sufi practices from the Hadhramout (a region in Yemen) filtered through South Asia. Some *keramat* demonstrate a syncretic blend of Taoist, Hindu and local animistic practices. There is also a tradition of Baba Chinese *keramat* that invoke spirits with Muslim/Malay names and iconography.

Some *keramat* are known for special powers such as helping to conceive children or granting winning lottery numbers, and specific offerings, like tying stones to nearby trees or railings, are made at these shrines.

#### **Types of Keramat**
<u>Living Keramat</u><br> 
*Keramat hidup*, literally “living *keramat*”, are not magicians but rather a type of saint who can perform miraculous feats such as teleportation, mind-reading, fortune-telling and healing the sick. C.O. Blagden mentioned a living keramat in his letter published in Walter Skeat’s seminal (if problematic) 2005 study *Malay Magic*: 

“I remember, in 1895, hearing of a little girl, living with her parents at Sungei Baru in the Alor Gajah district of Malacca, who was reputed to be *kramat*.  People used to travel considerable distances to visit her, and thereby gain some benefit or other. I was informed that the modus operandi was to swallow a small quantity of her saliva in a cup of water, but I never verified this statement.” 

Within the Islamic tradition, living *keramat* may be considered as *wali*, friends of God. Some of these people are known to be pious ascetics, while others merge with a South Asian tradition of “mad *fakirs*”, holy men who behave outrageously yet whose behaviours are tolerated as acts of the venerable. After death, the graves of such men may become *keramat*, the *wali* continuing to meditate and hear requests for intercession after his or her demise. It is said that *keramat* never die – energy cannot be destroyed.

In Singapore, the most famous *keramat* hidup is Habib Nuh, the “grand saint of Singapore”.  The biography of this man is vague. At his death in 1866, newspapers referred to him as “an old Kling man” who styled himself as Nabi Noah (Prophet Noah), who died in a house at Tanjong Pagar and was buried on a hill in the nearby cemetery.  In 1880, the owner of this burying ground declared a *wakaf* (land donated by a pious person and maintained by trustees) in the name of Habib Nuh bin Muhammed Puteh Alhabshi. Later that decade, an elaborate tomb was erected by Syed Mohamed bin Ahmad Alsagoff (1836–1906), a leading figure in the Muslim business world of Singapore and one of the original trustees of the *wakaf*. This tomb near Palmer Road remains the largest and most popular *keramat* on the island and attracts visitors from around the Muslim world.

Habib Nuh was not the only *keramat hidup* found in Singapore, nor were they always Muslims. In 1939, the *Sunday Tribune* featured an article about a 65-year-old Hindu man considered “Kramat Idop”. He was known as Swamy Kalian, and devotees, both Chinese and Malay, thronged his domicile on Mohamed Sultan Road. The article noted that “[e]verything in the *kramat* is primitive in the extreme. Three little bamboo huts and a pen about 15 feet long and just broad enough for two people to stand abreast in, are the only semi-permanent structures that this *kramat* contains”.  After living at this location for 30 years, it was said that one day the Swamy received “a visitation from the deity who watches over the premises during which he was told that from that day he would have the power to heal the sick, give sight to the blind, make the dumb talk, set cripples erect and raise the bedridden.” The deity instructed him not to accept money from his patients – a noble endeavor, although the treatments often involved slapping and hair pulling. 

While it is unclear if the deity who appeared to Swamy Kalian was a *keramat* or a Hindu god, it was believed that people could become *keramat hidup* through their interaction with a *wali*, often through a dream in which the saint revealed the location of his tomb. These people then became the caretakers of the *wali*’s *keramat* and could even become *keramat* themselves. 

One such person was Oli Chivli Kutti Mamoo, an Indian immigrant to Singapore who opened an *unani* pharmacy (a form of traditional medicine practiced by South Asian Muslims) on Arab Street in the 1920s. He named the pharmacy Bismillah Wali* (friend of God most merciful), a moniker he took on after a *wali* named Syed Mustapha revealed in a dream the location of his grave at an isolated bend of Upper Changi Road. Bismillah Wali bought the land in the 1930s and built an elaborate *keramat* for Syed, then moved his pharmacy to the site. He soon acquired a reputation as a *keramat hidup*. The sort of miracles attributed to Habib Nuh are lacking in the Bismillah Wali story, which took place well into the era of radio and television: his powers were more attuned to his knowledge of esoteric pharmacology and prognosticating winning lottery numbers.  After he died in 1962, Bismillah Wali was given special permission to be buried beside Syed Mustapha, and both were exhumed and reburied together in one grave at Pusara Abadi cemetery at Chua Chu Kang when the land was cleared for a public housing estate in 1979.

While the designation *keramat hidup* is usually reserved for humans, animals can also be living keramat, although the distinction could be blurry as there are stories of *keramat hidup* who could transform into tigers and even lead an entire village of were-tigers.  Tigers and crocodiles – big predators who could also function as guardian spirits – were often considered *keramat*. However, any animal could be especially so if they were albino, deformed (such as being club-footed) or able to escape easily from traps. 

Animals in both corporeal and spirit forms are frequently seen near keramat, including a three-legged tiger at Radin Mas, a white tiger at Iskandar Shah, a white crocodile at Jangal Pir*, a black cobra at Keramat Maliki*, a snake half-brother of the caretaker at Keramat Siti Mariam in Kallang, and a fierce black turkey at Dato Mulia*. *Keramat* are also known for attracting huge flocks of pigeons.
