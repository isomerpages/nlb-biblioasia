#### A major site of intra-Asia trade between India and China, Malacca was also an important site in European expansion into Asia. Lee Kong Chian Research Fellow _Katrina Gulliver_ examines the importance of Malacca to Europe, and how the city developed with European influence.

Malacca was controlled by European powers for more than 400 years – by the Portuguese in 1511, the Dutch in 1641, and the British, first temporarily in 1795, then from 1824 as part of the Anglo-Dutch Treaty, in which the city was exchanged for Bengkulu in Sumatra.

Malacca held an important role in the European expansionist imagination. Tomé Pires said: “Whoever is lord of Malacca has his hand on the throat of Venice”. English texts from the 16th century onwards demonstrate a desire to capture the port, and the cultural position its name held as a symbol of wealth and the exotic. This paper looks at how Malacca was used, and how it demonstrates changing attitudes towards colonisation and the idea of the city.

Malacca was an important site in European expansion into Asia. In the 15th century, the city was a crucial nexus of a trade network from the Moluccas to Venice. Being at the “end of the monsoon”, it served as a major site for intra-Asia trade between China and India. I have chosen to look at the city from a different angle, in examining how important Malacca was to Europe, and how the city developed with European influence.

#### **European Perceptions of the City**

The term Golden Khersonese (or Chersonese) appears in Ptolemy’s geography, referring to what was later confirmed to be the Malay Peninsula. 1 This term was in use during the early modern period in Europe to refer more specifically to the region, and in a more vague, mythical sense as a site of treasure. During the late 15th century, the city of Malacca came to be known in Europe, and references to it began to appear in literature.

During Portuguese control of the city, the references became more common, both in factual references and literature. I am limiting my references to printed works that would have been available to a broader audience than unpublished manuscripts. Gasparo Balbi’s *Viaggio dell’Indie Orientali*, published in Venice in 1590, described Malacca’s location and what could be bought there (*sandoli*, *pocellane*: sandalwood and porcelain, p.64), and detailed the dates of the monsoon season between Goa and Malacca. 2

The overlap in usage between Malacca and Golden Chersonese is discussed in this 1604 text:

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*“Is it not easie to find Molaco in ancient bookes, which*<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*they called the golden Chersonese: the Cape of Comori,* <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*which was called the Promontorie of Coci; & that great &* <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*famous Iland of Sumatra, so well knowne by the ancient* <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*name of Taprobana.”* 3

The “great & famous illand” description also demonstrates a growing level of assumed knowledge in Europe about the East Indies, and how much they had even by this stage (the English East India Company’s first mission was in 1601) become part of the mental map projected from Europe.

A more detailed description of Malacca was given by Pierre d’Avity, translated into English in 1615:

“*Malaca is seated upon the river of Gaza, and is a good* <br>  *faire Towne, having in circuit neere twentie miles. The* <br>  *originarie or first inhabitants of this place report, that the* <br>  *beginning came of six or seven fishermen, which came to* <br> *dwell there, but their number increased, by the arrivall of* <br>  *other fishermen of Siam, Pegu, and Bengola, who built a* <br>  *towne, and framed a particular language, taking all the* <br>  *best kind of speech from other nations. They named their* <br>  *towne Malaca, which is growne so rich and mightie in a* <br>  *short time by reason of her situation, as she contends* <br>  *for precedence with the greatest townes, yea with some* <br>  *realmes thereabouts*. <br>  *The Countrie people sleepe upon trees for feare of* <br>  *Tygers, whereof there are so many as they will come* <br>  *into the towne for a prey. The Portugals who tooke this* <br>  *towne from a king of the Moores, found the scituation so* <br>  *commodious, as they have made it in a manner the Center* <br>  *of all the merchandise and trafficke of the East, and the* <br>  *head of a kingdome, which extends from Sincapura to* <br>  *Pullo, and Cambilan*;” 4
