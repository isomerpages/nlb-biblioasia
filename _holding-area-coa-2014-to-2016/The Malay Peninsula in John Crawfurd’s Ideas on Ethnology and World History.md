#### **Introduction**
Studying colonial writings, let alone understanding them, is a complex
undertaking. Ideas were relative to the author and could change over
time with global historical and intellectual developments. An author’s
perception could also change with age, experience and exposure to new
knowledge material. These features can be observed in the vast writings of
Dr John Crawfurd (1783–1868), Singapore’s second Resident, who served
with distinction from 1823 to 1826. Yet there is a tendency for scholars to
generalise their findings after reading selections or passages of an author’s
works. Examining only a fragment of an author’s writings will often yield
the expected results – a partial picture of the author’s ideas.

Mary Quilty’s *Textual Empires: A Reading of Early British Histories of
Southeast Asia* provides excellent coverage of the writings of key early
19th-century colonial writers on the Malay Peninsula, such as John Leyden
(1775–1811), Thomas Stamford Raffles (1781–1826), William Marsden
(1754 –1836), John Anderson (1795–1845) as well as Crawfurd. She goes
to great lengths to underscore the characteristics of their works and the intellectual influences that shaped their ideas and how their works
influenced the findings of others.1

Quilty’s analysis of Crawfurd’s writings, however, is limited to just three
of his publications. Her conclusion might have been different had she read
his other works. In total, Crawfurd wrote more than 70 books, periodicals
and articles in the course of his life. Nonetheless, given that her research
was published in 1998, Quilty might not have had the opportunity to access
Crawfurd’s other writings, as she would have today thanks to digitisation.
In spite of this, Gareth Knapman’s recent research on Crawfurd has shown
that Crawfurd’s opinions are still misunderstood – Crawfurd’s writings were
selected out of context and used to simplify 19th-century thought to the
point of misrepresentation.2

This paper seeks to explore Crawfurd’s diverse intellectual works to
determine how the inhabitants of the Malay Peninsula fit into his ideas on
ethnology and global views on history, and how he sought to apply these
concepts to chart the region’s history. Discussions regarding the traditional
homeland of the Malay Peninsula’s inhabitants, especially the Malays, are
a regular feature of his writings, and he would tie his hypothesis regarding
their origins to his ethnological view on the multiple origins of mankind. As
would become clear in his later ethnological articles, he explains the history
of the Malay Peninsula’s civilisational development in terms of his biological,
geographical and cultural understanding of the progress of mankind.

This paper will also examine how his ideas about the region were developed.
This offers us a glimpse of how British colonial discourse functioned, at least
during the 19th century. Some of Crawfurd’s knowledge was drawn directly
from his experiences and observations in the region, while others were
obtained from secondary readings and correspondence with his network
of scholars and sources in Europe and Asia. Although the Malay Peninsula during Crawfurd’s time was already home to multiracial communities, only
his views on what he considered the natives of the region – the Malays and
Aslian communities – will be covered in this study for reasons of scope.
His ideas about the mixed-race communities of the Straits, however, will be
touched on because of their connection with the local populace.

Among the 19th-century British scholar-administrators of the Malay
Peninsula, Crawfurd was one of the most accomplished in the intellectual
sphere. He was widely recognised by the scholarly community of his time
for his formidable intellect and his works on Asia (especially Southeast Asia),
as well as his contributions to the fields of ethnology and linguistics.3 *The
Spectator* noted in 1834 that “Crawfurd [was] well-known by his writings on
Eastern manners and statistics, and his exertions to open the British trade
with China and India”.4 Sir Frank Swettenham (1850–1946), former governor
of the Straits Settlements and commissioner for the Federated Malay States,
found that of Raffles, Marsden and Crawfurd, the latter wrote about the
Malay language with “probably the highest authority”.5

Crawfurd’s writings on Southeast Asia provided a wealth of information for
those with an interest in the region, especially merchants, intellectuals and
imperial civil servants (both aspiring and serving). They are still appreciated
for the insights they provide into Southeast Asia’s past, however flawed they
may be from today’s standpoint.6 In his intellectual pursuits, Crawfurd, like
many of his contemporaries, sought to understand the interplay between
mankind and its history. The inhabitants of the Malay Peninsula were often featured in his extensive writings on ethnology and (what would
now be termed as) world history. Crawfurd would, furthermore, use his
understanding of the Malay Peninsula’s inhabitants – racial features,
languages, their place in the civilisation scale of mankind and how they
got there, and communities that emerged out of interracial marriage – to
support his scientific position on human nature and their history, as well as
his views on polygenesis.

#### **A Sketch of Crawfurd’s Life and Career**
John Crawfurd was born on 13 August 1783, on the island of Islay in the
west of Scotland.7 His father, Samuel Crawfurd, was a medical doctor from
Ayrshire, known to be “a man of sense and prudence”, and his mother
was Margaret née Campbell.8 Crawfurd was educated in a village school
in Bowmore, Islay. In 1799, he enrolled in medical school in Edinburgh;
medicine was a field for which, “he never had much taste, having been
chosen for him”, according to his 1868 obituary in *The Sydney Morning
Herald*.9 It later became evident that Crawfurd’s interests lay in languages,
history, ethnology, natural sciences and political administration.

At the conclusion of his studies in 1803, he left for Calcutta, India, as an
assistant surgeon in the East India Company’s Bengal medical service,
being assigned to the army.10 In 1808, after five years of active service in the
northwestern provinces of India, Crawfurd was appointed to the medical
staff of Prince of Wales Island (present-day Penang), where he used his time to study the Malay language and its people.11 In 1811, together with Thomas
Stamford Raffles and John Leyden, Crawfurd was invited by Lord Minto
(1751–1814, also known as Gilbert Elliot, then Governor-General of India) to
accompany him on a military expedition against the Dutch in Java.12

This marked a major turning point in Crawfurd’s career; he would become,
as the anthropologist Ter Ellingson would best describe him, “a doctorturned-
colonial-diplomat”.13 He held various senior administrative posts
during the British occupation of Java (1811–16) because of his command
of the Malay language, eventually becoming Resident at the central court
of the Sultan of Yogyakarta.14 Crawfurd studied both ancient Kawi and
contemporary Javanese and befriended the Javanese aristocratic literati.15

Upon his return to Britain in 1817, he became a fellow of the Royal Society.
The advantage of Crawfurd’s position and local connections in the Malay
Peninsula and Java enabled him to acquire a number of local manuscripts.16
He would later compile the information he had gathered during his sojourn
in Southeast Asia and publish his widely-acclaimed three-volume *History of
the Indian Archipelago* in 1820.17 This seminal work, according to an article
a few decades later in the *Journal of the Indian Archipelago and Eastern Asia*,
placed “him in the first rank of ethnographers”.18

In 1821, Crawfurd left England again for India; this time he was assigned
to head a mission to Siam (present-day Thailand) and Cochin China (now
Vietnam), with the chief objective of establishing trade. This mission did not succeed because of suspicions raised among local authorities, and he was
unable to expand the East India Company’s commercial relations beyond
the status quo.19 On 9 June 1823, Crawfurd succeeded William Farquhar
(1774–1839) to become the second Resident of Singapore – Crawfurd had
first visited the island in 1822 en route from India to Siam – and remained
in office until 1826.20 He continued to be active in the British East India
Company after serving as Resident in Singapore, undertaking diplomatic
assignments in Burma, before retiring from the Company in 1827.21

Crawfurd attempted to run for Parliament, but was unsuccessful in his
election campaigns in Scotland and England.22 Although he had left the
region for good, he continued to take a great interest in matters concerning
the Far East until the end of his life, as evident in his continued publications
on the region. He also became the first president of the London-based Straits
Settlements Association on 31 January 1868.23 Crawfurd passed away on the
night of 11 May 1868, at his residence in Elvaston Place, South Kensington,
London, at the age of 85, and was survived by his son and two daughters.24

#### **Crawfurd’s Studies and the Workings of British Imperial Knowledge**
Crawfurd’s obituaries tell us that his literary fame continued to rise even
after he ended his career in Asia, to the extent that it seemed to have
outshone his civil service accomplishments in the Far East.25 In spite of
his unsuccessful attempts in getting elected into the House of Commons,
Crawfurd continued making headlines in the scholarly world by producing
notable publications such as *A Grammar and Dictionary of the Malay Language* (1852) and *A Descriptive Dictionary of the Indian Islands & Adjacent
Countries* (1858), as well as through his journal contributions to the scholarly
periodical of the Ethnological Society of London – which he led in 1861 as
president.26 As a leading ethnographer and expert on Southeast Asia, he was
well known among prominent intellectuals of the time, and was counted
among Charles Darwin’s circle of friends.27

Crawfurd’s publications on the Far East were the result of his extensive
journeys and voyages during his time in the region, where he amassed diverse
materials on ethnology, natural history, local history, geography and geology.28
Examining his major publications on Southeast Asia, such as *History of the
Indian Archipelago, Grammar and Dictionary of the Malay Language or A
Descriptive Dictionary of the Indian Islands and Adjacent Countries*, would
allow one to grasp how he developed his knowledge about the region and,
more importantly, the features of British imperial knowledge.

Much has been said since the publication of Edward Said’s remarkable 1978
work, *Orientalism*, which highlighted the issue of Euro-centrism in Western
writings on the rest of the world and its literature as a means of justifying
superiority over non-Western peoples (in other words, imperialism).29
To accomplish these agenda, Said demonstrated how the East had been
projected in a way that differentiated it from the West, hence making it the
“other”.30 As expected, the result was inaccurate, sensational and exaggerated
portrayals of the East in Western discourse.

*Orientalism*, nevertheless, only reveals one aspect of imperial literature, and
must not be taken as representative of all colonial writings about the outside
world. They were more than just about creating tales to satisfy imperialistic
agenda. Discussing British knowledge productions of India, Christopher
Bayly underscored that they arose from natural curiosity and the desire to
understand the world as it was, as well as from the simple aim of domination.31

We must move beyond the fashionable notion of “knowledge is power” and
consider the diversity of knowledge. To be more comprehensive, attention
should be given to the author’s intention or purpose of writing, and to
examine whether the publication was intended as a fictional work, to
advance scientific knowledge, to collect commercial data, for administrative
purposes (such as population census and surveying reports), to serve as
official information on the region (for instance, literature on travel, science,
and history), or as a medium to support a policy.

The knowledge produced by Crawfurd belonged to the category of
formal, or “factual”, information, where accuracy was of key concern. The
reputation of his publications rested on how others measured the quality
of information provided. Any inaccuracies or unfaithful representations
would degrade the reputation of his work and scholars who produced these
kinds of literature were well aware of that. Fictionalising foreign places and
their inhabitants would not serve the interest of the author and his readers,
whose primary concern was to obtain factual information on the region.
Reviews would appraise these works for the quality of information they
provided, as evidenced in a review of Crawfurd’s 1858 dictionary by the
*Journal of the Indian Archipelago and Eastern Asia*: “[It is] a ready source of
accurate information of the most varied and substantial kind, conveyed in
an agreeable, condensed and lucid style, the book is invaluable”.32

Quilty has shown that scholars of the Malay world such as Crawfurd,
Raffles and Marsden had the same desire for their works to educate the
public and help expand their general knowledge of the world.33 They were
not interested in creating sensational stories about the Far East, and this
was explicitly stated in Crawfurd’s positive remarks on Marsden’s *History
of Sumatra* (1818): “He was the first literary and scientific Englishman who,
with the advantages of local experience, treated of the Malayan countries;
all our knowledge before him being confined to the crude narratives of
mariners and voyagers.”34

If misinformation was provided, it was also often done so unintentionally.
Inaccuracy could stem from the inability to gain access to the desired information, and scholars often had to resort to other means of obtaining
it, such as hearsay, the accounts of travelling merchants, explorers and
travellers, and from studying literature about the region – both antiquated
and recent. In many respects, these works are not very different in their
approach from contemporary scholarly literature.

Reading Crawfurd’s publications on Southeast Asia would reveal that his
main concern was the search for truths. This is not to say, however, that
the knowledge produced by colonial scholars such as Crawfurd were free
from misconceptions, as evidenced in the response by Indian nationalist,
politician and scholar, Dadabhai Naoroji (1827–1917), towards Crawfurd’s
article, “On the Physical and Mental Characteristics of the European
and Asiatic Races of Man”.35 Naoroji rebuked Crawfurd’s description of
the supposed mental inferiority of Asians to Europeans, saying that this
“superficial observation and imperfect information” was one that was
typical of foreign travellers and writers.36 Nonetheless, the fact that Naoroji’s
criticism of his work was read to and published in the Ethnological Society
of London’s periodical suggests that there was interest among its members
to test the strength of Crawfurd’s hypothesis.

As a historian, Crawfurd would assess the quality of his information to
determine its reliability, compare it to other available sources and discuss
its contents.37 Where the accuracy of the information was in question and
he had no alternative sources, Crawfurd would caution his audiences to
give the source the benefit of the doubt. In a footnote in *History of the
Indian Archipelago*, for example, he warned his readers to take the account
of the introduction of Islam into Macassar by the 17th-century French
merchant and traveler, Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, with a grain of salt, because
he “generally found Tavernier a superficial and unfaithful narrator”.38
Crawfurd would also admit his lack of knowledge in subjects he was unsure
about, as shown in his 1866 ethnological paper on the physical and mental characteristics of the “Negro”: “Of the social condition of the small Negroes
of the Malay Peninsula and the Philippine Islands we know too little to
enable us to give any authentic details.”39 In *A Descriptive Dictionary of
the Indian Islands and Adjacent Countries*, he also acknowledged that his
works might not be free from mistakes, which suggests that he was leaving
room for others to improve on his findings, although he did not directly
express this:
