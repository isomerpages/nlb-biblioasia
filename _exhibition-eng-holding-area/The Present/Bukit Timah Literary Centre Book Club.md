**About**:	Bukit Timah Literary Centre operates as one of the principal activity units under Bukit Timah Community Club. The reading club functions as an integral component of this broader literary organisation. The Literary Centre maintains an active publishing programme, producing literary books and magazines that contribute to Singapore's Chinese literary landscape. 
The reading club is specifically dedicated to promoting and developing Singapore Chinese literature, recognising the importance of nurturing local literary culture whilst connecting it to broader Chinese literary traditions. Through systematic discussions of literary books and magazines, the reading club fulfils a dual purpose: fostering critical appreciation of literary works amongst participants whilst serving as a platform for recommending exceptional publications to the wider community.
