The Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) is the world’s largest open access digital library for biodiversity resources. It was created in 2006 when a group of leading natural history and botanical libraries came together to make their digitised collections available in a single online repository at [www.biodiversitylibrary.org](www.biodiversitylibrary.org).

The collections of the United States-based BLH are drawn from an international consortium of more than 120 natural history, botanical, research and national libraries, including renowned institutions such as the Smithsonian Libraries in Washington D.C., the American Museum of Natural History in New York, the Natural History Museum in London and the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew, London.

The BHL provides free access to the world’s collective knowledge on biodiversity and natural history, and has attracted more than nine million users worldwide since its inception. Such unhindered access to existing as well as new, ground-breaking research relating to the environment and ecosystem is all the more important given the quickening pace of global warming and climate change, and its catastrophic impact on future generations.
