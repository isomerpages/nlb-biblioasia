**About**:	3G Reading Club was established in 2006 by a dedicated group of Singapore Chinese language teachers with the mission of promoting reading, enhancing humanistic literacy and cultural identity within the community. The name "3G" represents the relay and inheritance across three generations of educators who are committed to preserving and advancing Chinese educational traditions. Using reading as a bridge, they continue the spirit of Chinese language education. The club's activities centre on in-depth guided reading discussions that focus on Chinese and foreign classics, local literature, and educational works. These sessions are designed to guide participants from reading to thinking, promoting Chinese language reading from interest towards critical thinking and practical application.
