P. Krishnan, who uses the pseudonym Puthumaithasan, is a prolific Tamil writer and 2008 Cultural Medallion award winner. Well-versed in Tamil literature and grammar, he is also regarded as an authority on the language.
 
Krishnan started writing professionally in 1951 but rose to prominence in the mid-1960s with his radio play *Adukkuveettu Annaasamy*, a 52-episode comedic drama based on life in Housing and Development Board flats. He then wrote a 52-episode sequel, *Maadiveettu Mangalam*, which was also widely praised. His extensive literary output includes about 40 short stories, more than 100 articles, poems, reviews and special radio plays, and over 360 social, comedic, literary and thriller dramas. He has published six books, and at 
the age of 80 is still an active writer.

Krishnan joined Radio Singapore in 1953 as a part-time artiste for the Indian and Tamil school programmes section. He became a full-time announcer for the Indian section after 1963 and retired in 1992 as a senior executive producerpresenter. Over the course of his career, he encouraged children to participate in programmes that he had created especially for them. Many of his students have become famous writers and radio and television presenters.

In recognition of Krishnan’s dedication and contribution to the Tamil language and literary landscape, he has been conferred many prestigious local and international awards. His legacy will be a long-lasting one that is felt for many generations to come.
