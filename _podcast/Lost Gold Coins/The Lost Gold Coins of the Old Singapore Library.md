---
<p>In the mid-19th century, two ancient gold coins were uncovered near present-day
Keppel Harbour. Unfortunately, the Malay coins vanished before they could
be studied carefully. The Jawi inscriptions on the coins were recorded
though but they didnâ€™t make sense. More than a 180 years later, Foo Shu
Tieng tries to solve the case.</p>
