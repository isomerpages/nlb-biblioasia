When Stamford Raffles married the elegant Sophia Hull in February 1817, his family life seemed to be full of happiness. His earlier marriage, to Olivia Mariamne Devenish, a widow nearly ten years older than him, had ended with her untimely death in Java. Drawing on a wide range of sources including new findings from birth records, marriage registers, letters and wills, historian John Bastin makes an invaluable contribution to what is known about the members of Sir Stamford Raffles' family. This book is a superb account of Raffles' ancestry, immediate family and closest relations and how they intertwined with each step of his career.
