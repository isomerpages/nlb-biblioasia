<p><strong>Coming in March</strong>
<br>
<br>Singapore's time zone has been changed at least seven times since 1905,
including during the Japanese Occupation when it was synchronised to Tokyo
time. Arts librarian Kenneth Tay explains the historical context for the
time zone changes, the origins of the Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) system,
and ways to measure time, including a rare atomic clock in a local laboratory.
