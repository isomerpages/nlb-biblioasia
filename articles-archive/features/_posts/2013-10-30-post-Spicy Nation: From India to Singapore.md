Indian cuisine is one of the most diverse in the world. India’s rich culinary heritage is closely linked with its ancient culture, traditions and mosaic of religious beliefs. Each region in India, despite using almost the same basic spices and herbs, employs a range of cooking techniques to produce unique and tantalising dishes found nowhere else in the world.

#### A spice for every need

Spices are the heart and soul of Indian cuisine; the use of spices has been an ancient tradition “recorded in Sanskrit texts 3,000 years ago.”1 The secret of Indian cuisine lies in the artful combination of spices, finding the right balance of each spice and tempering them skilfully in order to give each dish its distinct full-bodied flavour and aroma.

Spices are also believed to have medicinal properties. India’s ancient Ayurvedic medicine offers a “holistic form of healing”2 that lists the five basic tastes: sweet, sour, salty, pungent and bitter. Spices such as asafoetida, anise, cinnamon, cumin, turmeric, clove, fennel, carda-mom, nutmeg, fenugreek seeds, mustard seeds, saffron, coriander, curry leaves, bay leaves along with chilli, ginger, onion and garlic (many of which are grown in India) are commonly used to relieve indigestion, infections, the common cold, arthritic pains, and even to keep cholesterol levels in check and protect against heart disease. Spices are so important to India that a dedicated Spices Board was estab¬lished in 1986 with 32 members and its headquarters in Cochin, Kerala.3 

Apart from using spices individually, masala, basically a mix of spices, is used to add flavour even to the simplest of dishes.4 *Masala* comes in various combinations, from dry mixtures to wet pastes, from the more common North Indian *garam masala* — typically a mix of peppercorns, cumin, clove, cinnamon and cardamom pods — to a fiery South Indian coconut-based *masala*. These *masala* concoctions can range in taste from mild to searingly hot.

#### Curry, Curry Leaves and Curry Powder

Native to India and Sri Lanka, the curry leaf is an important herb in South Indian cooking. This small, fragrant and dark green leaf has a distinctive peppery flavour that adds robustness to any dish. Curry leaves are chopped or used whole and added to hot oil for tempering, and used as garnishes in salads, curries, marinades and soups to improve the taste. As observed by Wendy Hutton in Singapore Food, the Indians say there is “no substitute for these small, dark green leaves from the karuvapillai tree.” The use of curry leaves is even mentioned in early Tamil literature dat¬ing back to the 1st to 4th century CE.

Intriguingly, what we commonly understand as “curry” originates from a Tamil word for spiced sauces. More specifically, it refers to “a mixture of spices including cumin, coriander, turmeric, fennel, fenugreek, cloves, cinnamon, cardamom and often garlic, with chilli [as the] the dominant spice.” Curry powder is actually something that the British created for commercial reasons and in fact never existed in India until the 18th century. A curry could have plenty of gravy from the use of coconut milk, yoghurt or pulverised dhal, or legumes to thin out the spice mixture. Dry curries, on the other hand, tend to be more intense in flavour as most of the liquid used in their preparation has been allowed to evaporate.

#### North Indian Delights

Although influenced by different religions and traditions, as well as varying regional climates, India’s culinary delights can generally be categorised into northern and southern cuisines.

The Moghuls who ruled northern India for 300 years were Muslims, and this region has many Indian restaurants that do not serve pork. The Moghuls introduced the Persian style of cooking to Indian cuisine, which is why North Indian food is milder and less restrained in its use of spices. Mughali dishes, such as creamy *korma* curries and fragrant rice dishes like *briyani* and *pulao* use exotic spices, and dried fruits and nuts.5 It is in also in the north, at the Himalayan foot¬hills of Jammu and Kashmir and Dera Dun, where basmati rice, the long grain rice also called the “the king of rice”, is grown.6 This aromatic rice is used in the cooking of briyani and complements most Indian food.

Another popular dish in North India is *tandoori* chicken, traditionally cooked in a *tandoor* (clay oven). It is simply prepared with yogurt and spices yet this tantalising dish is a favourite with many diners. A popular Kashmiri dish, *roghan josh* is lamb marinated in yogurt and spices. *Mishani* is a seven-course lamb dish that is widely served in Kashmiri weddings and it is an item most sought after in wedding menus.

Punjab, also known as the breadbox of India, is famous for its assortment of leavened and unleavened bread, such as *naan*, *chapati* bread, and *tandoori rotis*. Interestingly, it was the Moghuls from Persia who introduced *naan* (“bread” in Persian) to northern India.

#### Fiery South Indian food

The time-honoured food traditions of South India continue till this day and it is not unusual to see South Indians sitting cross-legged on a floor mat eating off a stainless steel plate (*thali*) or a fresh banana leaf. South Indian dishes are often spicier than their North Indian counterparts, and often include coconut (used to make chutneys and curries) and rice, which is a staple food in the south. South Indian dishes do not use as much ghee (clarified butter) and yoghurt as North Indian ones. Many spices, such as fenugreek, dried red chillies, mustard seeds and peppercorn, used in South Indian cooking lend the cuisine its fiery reputation. Common South Indian dishes include *dosa* or *thosai* (crispy savoury pancakes), *idli* (steamed rice cakes), *sambhar* (lentil curry) and *vadai* (fritters).
 
#### Indian sweets

Whether in the north or south, sweets, most of which are highly calorific and contain lashings of sugar and ghee, are traditionally served after meals. *Payasam* (in Tamil) or *kheer* (in Hindi), made of rice or wheat vermicelli, is commonly eaten during festive occasions and weddings. The payasam served at Ambalappuzha Temple (see text box) in Kerala is especially famous among Hindu devotees.7 Other traditional Indian sweets include *gulab jamun*, *mysore pak*, *halwa* and *laddoo*. *Gulab jamun* are little balls of milk powder and plain flour deep fried and drenched in sugary syrup, and usually served at North Indian weddings. *Mysore pak* — made of ghee, gram flour and sugar — hails from Mysore, in the southern state of Karnataka. It is often referred to as a royal sweet as it was concocted in the kitchen of Mysore Palace for the king. There are several variations of *halwa* with either semolina, wheat flour, mung bean or carrot as its base while *laddoo* are bright orange ball-shaped confections offered as a *prasad* (gift) to guests at weddings and religious occasions.

#### The origins of vegetarianism

The roots of vegetarianism in India can be traced to religions such as Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism. Many consider "Indian cuisine ... to be the cradle of vegetarian culinary art."8 Gujeratis, who are mostly vegetarian, have perfected the art of vegetarian cooking. Using the simplest ingredients, they transform the most basic dishes into mouthwatering delicacies. Typically, a Gujerati meal begins with cumin-spiked buttermilk, followed by hot fluffy *roti* (unleavened bread), accompanied by a variety of lentils, vegetables, curds and pickles.

The South Indians also offer an astonishing variety of vegetarian dishes. Both Karnataka and Tamil Nadu have a "strong vegetarian bent to their cuisine."9 In Kerala, during an ancient harvest festival called the Onam festival, as many as 24 vegetarian dishes are served at just one sitting. Indian cooks take great pride in creating exciting vegetarian dishes out of exotic greens like snake gourd, ridge gourd and the pod-like drumstick or *murungaltai* in Tamil, as well as more prosaic leafy vegetables, lentils, dried beans of all kinds, and unripened jackfruit and plantains.

#### Indian Vegetarian Restaurants

Multicultural Singapore is a paradise for food. Among the many local cuisines available here, Indian food is one of the favourites. The early Tamil immigrants opened their first Indian vegetarian eatery, Ananda Bhavan Vegetarian Restaurant, in 1924 along Selegie Road to satiate the appetites of homesick Indians. Known as the "most authentic old world restaurant,"10 the original Selegie Road outlet has since closed but there are five branches, the largest of which is located along Serangoon Road. Its signature dishes cover a wide range of traditional dishes such as *thosai*, *idli*, *chapati* (bread made from whole wheat flour) and *puri* (deep fried bread).

Komala Vilas, another vegetarian restaurant, opened in 1934, and has been proclaimed by some as the most popular vegetarian restaurant in Singapore. The restaurant owner, Mr Gunasekaran, says the reason why Komala Vilas has remained popular is because it has successfully retained its traditional flavours all these years without any compromise. His late father Mr Rajoo, whose hometown is in Thanjaur (renowned for its good food) in Tamil Nadu, South India, was the founder of Komala Vilas. "Komala" was the name of his boss's wife and "vilas" means home. So Komala Vilas means a home for good Indian vegetarian food.

Komala Vilas' speciality is the *masala thosai*; so popular that even non-Indians love it. It is a crisp, savoury, thin pancake eaten with potatoes spiced with *masala*. Other accompaniments include *sambhar* (lentil curry) and coconut chutney. The restaurant hardly advertises and it has been through word of mouth that Komala Vilas has expanded to three locations and is now a household name in Singapore.

When Mr Gunasekaran noticed more and more people ordering *masala thosai*, he added more varieties. The menu has since expanded from simple *thosai* to other South Indian dishes like, *idli*, variations of *thosai* (crisp thin Indian pancake), *rava thosai*, (thosai made with semolina flour) pepper *thosai*, *utthappam*, (thick pancake) vadai (a savoury snack made from dal, len¬til or gram flour and deep fried), as well as North Indian meals with an assortment of chutneys. Its subsidiary, Komalas, run by Mr Gunasekaran’s brother, employs a fast food concept to vegetarian food.

#### SINGAPOREAN INDIAN FARE

Some of the most renowned Indian restau¬rants in Singapore are Samy’s Curry, which opened in the 1950s, Muthu’s Curry in 1969 and Banana Leaf Apolo in 1974. These three restaurants are known in particu¬lar for their mouthwatering and eye-pop-pingly hot fish head curry. Few people are aware that fish head curry is actually a Singaporean concoction. Eating the fish head is not something common among ethnic Indians, as only those who could not afford to buy the whole fish would eat the head. On the other hand, the Chinese had long ago discovered the delecta¬ble sweetness of the flesh from the head and cheeks of a fish; the Teochews for in¬stance eat steamed fish head with gin¬ger and pickled vegetables. Enterprising Indian restaurateurs must have noticed this peculiar habit and decided to experi¬ment cooking fish head with curry spices instead, leading to the birth of this fu¬sion dish.11 No one could have imagined its popularity.
The genesis of fish head curry can be traced to an Indian migrant, Mr M.J.
