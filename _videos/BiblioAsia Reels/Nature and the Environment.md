The skeleton of a blue whale was once the centrepiece of the former Raffles Museum. The skeleton was gifted to the National Museum of Malaysia in 1974. 

Another whale skeleton, that of an adult female sperm whale, is currently on display at the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum. The whale carcass was found drifting off the coast of Jurong Island in July 2015.
