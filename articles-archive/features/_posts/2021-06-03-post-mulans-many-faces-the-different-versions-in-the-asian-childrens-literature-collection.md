#### **Goh Yu Mei** looks at how the story of Mulan takes on different approaches when retold as a children’s tale in English and Chinese.

“唧唧复唧唧，木兰当户织。不闻机杼声，惟闻女叹息。” [^1]

(Translation: Click, click, click, click, Mulan is at her loom. One could not hear the sound of the loom weaving, but only Mulan’s sigh.”)
These are the opening lines in 《木兰辞》 (*The Ballad of Mulan*),[^2] believed to have been composed during the Northern dynasties period (北朝, c. 386–581).[^3]

Widely accepted as the earliest written version of the story of Mulan (木兰), the 62-line poem tells the inspiring story of a young woman who disguises herself as a man so that she can take her aged father’s place when he is conscripted to join the army in the fight against the Tartars. The ballad was subsequently included in《乐府诗集》(*Yuefu Shiji*), an anthology of poetry compiled by Guo Maoqian (郭茂倩) during the Song Dynasty (960–1276). 

During the Tang dynasty (618–907), the story was retold as《木兰歌》(*The Song of Mulan*), a poem written by Wei Yuanfu (韦元甫). Several centuries later, during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), Xu Wei 
(徐渭) composed the opera《雌木兰替父从军》(*Female Mulan Took her Father’s Place in the Army*). The story was then turned into a novel,《北魏奇史闺孝烈传》 (*The Legendary Story of a Filial and Heroic Girl from the Northern Wei*) by Zhang Shaoxian (张绍贤) during the Qing dynasty (1644–1912).[^4]

Although filial piety and loyalty are constant themes in the different representations of Mulan, these values are portrayed differently by different authors. In Zhang Shaoxian’s novel, for instance, Mulan commits suicide when she is forced to choose between returning home to care for her parents (i.e. filial piety), or remaining in the army to serve the emperor (i.e. loyalty). The tragic ending in this narrative of Mulan hints at a criticism of the interpretations of filial piety and loyalty in earlier versions of the tale.[^5]

Recent efforts to reimagine the story of Mulan consist of books, stage adaptations, television serials and movies. They include the chapter “White Tigers” in Maxine Hong Kingston’s *The Woman Warrior: Memoirs of a Girlhood Among Ghosts* (1976)[^6] and of course Disney’s *Mulan*, comprising an animated film in 1998 and a live action drama film in 2020.

Given that the tale is about 1,500 years old, the story of Mulan has inspired numerous books and iterations of the tale, as well as in various languages and for different age groups, including children. Some of these titles are available in the Asian Children’s Literature Collection (ACL Collection) of the National Library (see text box on pp. 19–20).

The authors or editors of these titles have adopted different approaches in their versions by combining elements of older Mulan stories with new re-interpretations. These can be broadly categorised into two groups, namely the re-telling of “The Ballad of Mulan”, largely sticking to the original poem, and the re-writing of the story of Mulan, which involves adding significant new elements.

##### **Re-telling The Ballad of Mulan**
“脱我战时袍，著我旧时裳。当窗理云鬓，对镜贴花黄。”[^7]

(Translation: I remove my armour, change into my old dress; comb my hair by the window, and apply yellow powder in front of the mirror.)

Several titles in the ACL Collection closely follow the format in the earliest known poem, *The Ballad of Mulan. The Song of Mu Lan* (1995) by Jeanne M. Lee is a direct translation of the ancient poem alongside its original Chinese text.[^8] The English translation and the original poem, which is faithfully reproduced in traditional Chinese calligraphy by Lee’s father, Chan Bo Wen, are juxtaposed against watercolour paintings on silk by Lee, each corresponding to a scene described in the respective verses.

Lee dedicates the book “to all women, young and old” and notes that “the verses of the poem are still taught to children in China today and are sung in Chinese opera in different dialects”. She stresses that the values of filial piety and loyalty conveyed in the story of Mulan are still relevant today and that Mulan is a good role model for all females.

Another book, Song Nan Zhang’s *The Ballad of Mulan* (1998), is similar to Lee’s version, with the story in English and the original Chinese poem set against drawings depicting the different scenes.[^9] (Song also drew the illustrations in the book.)

In Song’s interpretation, each drawing is enclosed within a frame which is similar to how early Chinese books are bound. Although Song follows the original storyline closely, he also includes minor new details and new lines. For example, the following lines describe the scene where Mulan appears before her fellow soldiers in female attire:

“What a surprise it was when Mulan appeared at the door! 
Her comrades were astonished and amazed.
‘How is this possible?’ they asked.”[^10]

The original line from *The Ballad of Mulan*, “出门看伙伴，伙伴皆惊恐”, only states that when Mulan exits from her room and appears in front of her fellow soldiers, they are astonished. Her fellow soldiers’ question is a minor detail that Song has added, which is not found in the original poem.

At the end of Song’s book, there is a very short section titled “Historical Notes on Mulan” which explains the historical context of Mulan’s life and the development of the story from the early days until the present. It notes that the story (and poem) is a well-known folk tale studied by school children in China today. Song writes that the story continues to inspire Chinese women, and he dedicates the book to “everyone with an interest in ancient Chinese culture and literature”.

Closer to home, the story of Mulan has been re-written as a Chinese picture book,《花木兰》(*Hua Mulan*), and published in Singapore. Written by Li Xiang (李想) with illustrations by Zhang He (张禾), it follows the original storyline closely although the author has added minor new scenes, such as Mulan’s father teaching her martial arts.  

The picture book was first published in 1998 by Newton Publications, with a new edition two years later.[^11] The 1998 edition contains the original poem in classical Chinese, a re-telling of the story with additional details and a section on the historical context of the ballad. The 2000 edition includes the original poem rendered in simplified Chinese, which the 1998 version does not have.

#### **Re-writing the Story of Mulan**
“雄兔脚扑朔，雌兔眼迷离；两兔傍地走，安能辨我是雄雌？”[^12]

(Translation: The male rabbit hops rapidly, while the female rabbit has blurry eyes. When both are running side-by-side, how can one tell if I am male or female?)

Several other titles about Mulan found in the ACL Collection involve much more re-writing, and they include significant details or scenes not found in the original poem, “The Ballad of Mulan”.

*Fa Mulan: The Story of a Woman Warrior* (1998) by Robert D. San Souci, and illustrated by Jean Tseng and Mou-Sien Tseng, is one such example.[^13] In his “Author’s Note”, San Souci explains that he added scenes not explicitly mentioned in the original poem by “drawing on [his] study of the original poem in its historical and cultural context”.[^14]

He notes that the ballad had few details of the campaign against the Tartars so he obtained information on military organisation and strategy, and the advice Mulan shares with her generals, from Sun Tzu’s *The Art of War*. “It seems logical that Mulan, in her rise to generalship, would have studied this essential text in length – even committing its principles to memory,” he adds.[^15]

San Souci also injects an element of romance in his Mulan story, drawing his inspiration from the reference to a pair of male and female rabbits in the original verse that could be symbolic of a marriage bond.

Other contemporary authors have used details that might have originated from Xu Wei’s opera,《雌木兰替父从军》.  For example,《花木兰》(*Hua Mulan*; 2002) by Yong Chun (永春) mentions Mulan’s surname, Hua (花), along with her father’s name, Hua Hu (花弧), which was first mentioned in Xu’s opera.[^16] *In Mulan: A Story in English and Chinese* (2014) by Li Jian, the author writes that “Mulan learned Chinese calligraphy and reading from her father at a young age”,[^17] while Gang Yi and Xiao Guo’s *The Story of Mulan: The Daughter and the Warrior* (2007) says that “[Mulan’s] father taught her archery and horseback riding”.[^18] These embellishments are also found in Xu Wei’s opera and not in the original poem.

#### **A Classic Tale**
It is not surprising that the tale of Mulan has become a popular story for children. The intriguing plot captures the reader’s imagination while the tale itself offers vital lessons for impressionable young minds. 

As San Souci writes, Mulan’s courage and filial piety have inspired creators and readers in Chinese communities worldwide. The preface of Yong Chun’s《花木兰》notes that Mulan exemplifies the Chinese values of loyalty (忠), filial piety (孝), benevolence (仁) and love (爱), as well as the wish for peace (追求和平生活的愿望). On the back cover of Li Jian’s *Mulan*, the blurb highlights the fact that “it was [Mulan’s] love for her family and her father that made her into a great soldier”.[^19]

Even now, some 1,500 years after the tale was first written, Mulan continues to serve as an inspiration and role model for girls and women today.

|**OF FAMILIAL LOVE AND SACRIFICE**|

|By Michelle Heng|

|There is a Chinese proverb, 百善孝为先, which says that filial piety ranks first among all virtues.[^20] Filial piety is a major tenet of Confucian thought and has remained the cornerstone of Chinese society for thousands of years.[^21] According to the Classic of Filial Piety (孝经; Xiaojing), a Confucian classic treatise giving advice on filial piety, “Filial piety begins with the serving of our parents, continues with the serving of our ruler, and is completed with the establishment of our own character”.|

|The values of loyalty, respect and obedience to one’s parents and seniors, reflected in the  tale of Mulan, are also universal virtues that find common ground in several Asian tales centered on sacrifices made by children for their elderly kinfolk in the National Library’s Asian Children’s Literature (ACL) Collection.[^22]|

|An example of this is a re-telling of The Voice of the Great Bell,[^23] the story of a pure and beauteous Chinese maiden, Ko-Ngai, who makes the ultimate sacrifice when the emperor threatens to execute her father, Kouan-Yu, after he fails repeatedly to create the greatest of bells “strengthened with brass, deepened with gold, sweetened with silver” despite gathering the best artisans in the country for the monumental task. When the cast is made and the mould removed, the bell falls apart as the three metals did not combine. Ko-Ngai then sacrifices herself, as the only way the metals will bond is if a pure young maiden is thrown into the molten mass.|

|Other Asian tales focusing on the themes of familial love and filial devotion include those from Korea, Japan and Nepal. In the Korean tale titled In The Moonlight Mist,[^24] the heavenly king rewards a woodcutter who sacrifices his own happiness for his mother’s welfare by reuniting him with his family in heaven.|
 
|The much-loved Japanese folktale, The Wise Old Woman,[^25] tells of how a loving farmer shields his aged mother away from a cruel young lord who banishes elderly villagers, when they reach the age of 70, to the mountains and leave them to die there. When a nearby ruler threatens to invade the village unless the lord can perform three impossible tasks, only the farmer’s mother succeeds in solving them. The lord then reverses his decree and declares that elders “will be treated with respect and honour,  and will share with us the wisdom of their years”.|

|In the Nepalese fable, I, Doko: The Tale of a Basket,[^26] a man decides to abandon his ailing father by placing him in a basket on the temple steps. The man realises his mistake when his young son asks him to bring the basket back so that the son would not have to buy a new one when the time comes for him to carry his father to the temple to be abandoned. Told from the point of view of the basket called Doko, which has served the family for decades, the moral of the story is to treat old people with respect and deference even when they are ailing and are no longer useful.|

|These timeless Asian tales for children have captivated the young and the young at heart alike for many generations. It was for the purpose of raising the profile and increasing the appreciation of Asian-centric children’s literature that the ACL Collection was first initiated by the National Library of Singapore in the 1960s.[^27]|

|The collection was initially stocked with children’s literature of British and  American origins but steadily evolved over the years to reflect a stronger Asian focus. Vilasini Menon, one of the original curators of the collection, recalled being tasked to revamp the ACL Collection: “Singapore was a British colony. There was an existing children’s library, but the collection was in English for the English-speaking people and English expatriates. The books were all about pony-riding and English school stories, which were highly alien to our children.”[^28]|

|While recognising the collection’s possibilities as a resource for teachers intending to introduce Asian culture and stories to their young charges in Singapore, Menon was also mindful of the possible needs of researchers when making acquisitions. She looked to library review journals to decide which titles should be purchased, and developed the collection’s potential for cross-sectional study by including titles that reflected different attitudes towards Asia and Asians over time.[^29]|

|In the early 1960s, most of the titles in the collection were translated into English from their original languages because not many English titles were published in Asia. (One exception was the Philippines, where English is established as the lingua franca.)[^30]|

|Apart from its Asian-focused intent, the ACL Collection houses a treasure trove of uniquely crafted gems in the bookmaking tradition. Otogi-Banashi: A Miniature Toy-Book from Japan (1969)[^31] is a bilingual publication in Japanese and English penned by Tatsugoro Hirose. Embedded within a cut-out space in the pages are three Lilliputian books of much-loved Japanese folktales: “The Old Man Who Makes The Flowers Bloom”, “Momotaro” and “Kachi-Kachi Mountain”. Featuring distinctive woodblock-printed illustrations, the bindings of the miniature books and the slipcover are made of chiyogami, a traditional Japanese paper.[^32]|

|Another gem is the visually arresting Pang Tao (Flat Peaches): Eight Fairies Festival (c. 1900–1950)[^33] about a legendary group of deities. The rare bilingual title in English and Chinese is bound in an accordion format.|

|This book bears witness to how much the physical form of the book has evolved. Early books in China were made of narrow strips of bamboo tied together in a bundle using either silk or leather. Silk later replaced bamboo as a writing material and was rolled around rods like a scroll. With the invention of paper, books were made by folding a long strip of paper accordion-style.[^34]|

|In the decades that followed, the ACL Collection has been redefined to concentrate on material written in the four official languages of Singapore, and aimed at children and young adults up to 14 years old. Comprising picture books, fiction and non-fiction as well as reference books, the collection includes titles from Southeast Asia, East Asia, Central Asia and the Middle East.[^35]|

|The ACL Collection aspires to captivate, inform and foster awareness among readers and researchers of Asia’s rich cultural and literary heritage. The books in the collection, which number more than 12,000, are available for reference on Level 9 of the National Library Building, Victoria Street.|
