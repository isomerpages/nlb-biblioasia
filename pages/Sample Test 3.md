<h2><strong>Forgotten Food Campaigns</strong></h2>
<p>By Anonymous</p>
<p><em>Do you remember Singapore’s past food campaigns such as “Eat More Wheat” and “Eat Frozen Fish”? Librarian </em>Jacqueline
Lee<em> dishes up food campaign collaterals from the National Library Board's collections.</em>
</p>
<p>Singapore has been called a <a href="https://biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg/vol-8/issue-4/jan-mar-2013/singapore-campaigns/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">“city of campaigns”</a>.
Over the past few decades, there have been hundreds of campaigns on a variety
of themes from productivity to family planning to courtesy.</p>
<p>When my colleague mentioned that she had come across library materials
on frozen food campaigns in the 1980s, I became intrigued and started researching
food campaigns beginning from Singapore’s independence.</p>
<p>These campaigns aimed to change public behaviour when it came to the foods
they ate. Getting people to eat something different from the foods they
are accustomed to is always a tall order. At the same time, they also had
to address the public’s belief that the substitutes were not as good or
delicious.</p>

<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“Eat More Wheat” Campaign in 1967</strong>
</p>
<p>Soon after Singapore’s independence, the Eat More Wheat campaign was launched
to encourage the public to eat more wheat and less rice. At that time,
wheat was half the price of rice, and rice prices had increased due to
a world shortage.<a href="#_ftn1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[1]</a>
