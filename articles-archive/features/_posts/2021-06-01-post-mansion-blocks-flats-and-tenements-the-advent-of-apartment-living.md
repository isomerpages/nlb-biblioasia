#### Customs and traditions change over time. Through buildings like Amber Mansions, Eu Court and Meyer Flats, colonial architects Swan & Maclaren helped to introduce the concept of apartment living in Singapore, as **Julian Davison** tells us.

The late flourishing of the black and white house notwithstanding, the residential architecture of Singapore in the early 1920s was notable for the emergence of a new way of living, namely the residential apartment block. In the West, the modern middle-class apartment dwelling has its origins in Baron Haussmann’s reconstruction of Paris in the 1850s.[^1]

The idea gradually spread to other European cities and eventually the Americas – significantly, the Stuyvesant Apartments on East 18th Street. Generally recognised as New York’s first purpose-built apartment block, it was designed by the Paris-trained architect Richard Morris Hunt in 1869 and was often referred to as the “French Flats”. 

In Singapore, the earliest apartment dwelling per se was probably the Elias building at the junction of Niven and Wilkie roads, followed by Manasseh Meyer’s Crescent apartments in Tanjong Katong in 1912 and Meyer Mansions on North Bridge Road in 1918, all designed by Swan & Maclaren. 

#### **Amber Mansions, Orchard Road, 1920–22**

After World War I (1914–18), the idea began to gather traction in a big way. The most prominent of the early post-war apartment blocks was Amber Mansions at the junction of Orchard Road and Penang Lane. Commissioned by the Singapore Building Corporation in 1919, Amber Mansions is often hailed as Singapore’s first apartment block; clearly it wasn’t. It is also often singled out for special mention as Singapore’s first shopping centre. It wasn’t that either. 

Nevertheless, Amber Mansions was an important and innovative building that was popularly associated in the public’s imagination with the emergence of a modern lifestyle in the years between the two world wars. It remained an architectural landmark symbolising that era until its demolition in 1984 to make way for Dhoby Ghaut MRT Station.

The Singapore Building Corporation, despite its civic-sounding name, was actually a property development company owned by influential Jewish businessman Joseph Aaron Elias, better known as Joe Elias.2 The three-storeyed Amber Mansions at the bottom end of Orchard Road was named after the Elias family’s Jewish clan name; Amber Road, where the Elias family owned a lot of property, came by its name the same way. 

Joe Elias’s father, A.J. Elias, was one of the pioneers of apartment living in Singapore with his Bidwell-designed, two-storey duplex development at the junction of Wilkie and Niven roads.3 It was an experiment that his son determined to repeat, albeit several years after the death of Elias senior in 1902. 

Drawings submitted to the Municipality for planning permission reveal that Amber Mansions was originally intended to be entirely residential, but subsequently the ground floor was remodelled to be rented out as commercial premises – Malayan Motors and the Municipal Gas Department were among the first tenants. Several of the residential units on the floors above were likewise redesigned as office spaces, which were then taken up by lawyers and architectural practices. 

Viewed from the junction of Orchard Road and Dhoby Ghaut, the most striking feature of Amber Mansions was its bowed elevation as the building turned the corner from Orchard Road into Penang Lane, surmounted by a large Dutch gable.4

Perhaps more significant, architecturally, was the complete absence of any Classical ornament or detailing, the facades being more or less stripped of all surface decoration. Broad, flattened arches spanned the intervals between the piers of the five-footway verandah at street level, while the Dutch gable that articulated the corner was repeated at intervals along each wing. Otherwise, the building wore an uncommonly severe facade. 

Amber Mansions cost around $400,000 to build, the contracting work being undertaken by Soh Mah Eng, who was Swan & Maclaren’s regular partner in the post-war era. 






|Established in 1892, Swan & Maclaren (named after Archibald Alexander Swan and James Waddell Boyd Maclaren) is the oldest architectural practice in Singapore. Its architects, such as Regent Alfred John Bidwell, Denis Santry and Frank Lundon, designed many of Singapore’s historic buildings, including the Raffles Hotel, Teutonia Club (present-day Goodwood Park Hotel), the Chesed-El Synagogue, Stamford House, Victoria Memorial Hall and Theatre, and the Tanjong Pagar Railway Terminal.

|The first 50 years of its history is detailed in Julian Davison’s Swan & Maclaren: A Story of Singapore Architecture, published by ORO Editions and the National Archives of Singapore in 2020. In this edited extract from Chapter 30, the author looks at some of the earliest apartment buildings in Singapore built by the firm. Note: Apart from the David Elias Building on Middle Road and the two rows of shophouses next door, all the other apartment blocks mentioned in this essay have been demolished.|
