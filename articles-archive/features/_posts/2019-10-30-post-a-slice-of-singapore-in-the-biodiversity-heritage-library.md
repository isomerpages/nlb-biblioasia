#### With climate change on the rise, access to research on biodiversity and natural history is all the more important. **Lim Tin Seng** tells us about the Biodiversity Heritage Library.

The Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) is the world’s largest open access digital library for biodiversity resources. It was created in 2006 when a group of leading natural history and botanical libraries came together to make their digitised collections available in a single online repository at [www.biodiversitylibrary.org](www.biodiversitylibrary.org).

The collections of the United States-based BLH are drawn from an international consortium of more than 120 natural history, botanical, research and national libraries, including renowned institutions such as the Smithsonian Libraries in Washington D.C., the American Museum of Natural History in New York, the Natural History Museum in London and the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew, London.

The BHL provides free access to the world’s collective knowledge on biodiversity and natural history, and has attracted more than nine million users worldwide since its inception. Such unhindered access to existing as well as new, ground-breaking research relating to the environment and ecosystem is all the more important given the quickening pace of global warming and climate change, and its catastrophic impact on future generations.

#### **Access to Biodiversity Materials**

The BHL portal, which was initially launched with just over 300 titles, has seen an impressive increase in its collection size over the last 13 years. Today, users can access over 57 million pages of biodiversity resources, comprising more than 150,000 titles and nearly 248,000 volumes, some of which date back to the 15th century. To ensure that the collection can be accessed freely, BHL has worked with the respective rights holders to make copyrighted materials openly available under Creative Commons licences.

To facilitate ease of retrieval and access, and also to encourage the use of its collections and data, the BHL has partnered with the international taxonomic community, publishers, bioinformaticians and information technology professionals to incorporate various useful tools and services on the portal.

For instance, every title in the BHL repository can be downloaded in a variety of formats, including PDF. As the scientific names of all key animals and plants that appear in BHL books have been indexed, users can also conduct comprehensive taxonomic name searches. To date, the BHL has indexed more than 191 million taxonomic names in its collections. To further aid research, these taxonomic names as well as all the bibliographic records of the books can be exported, and are compatible with existing software systems.

#### **Thematic Collections**

Some of the collections in the BHL are categorised into themes to help users navigate the breadth of biodiversity topics the portal contains and, in the process, discover interesting resources. Here is a preview of some of the unique collections on the BHL portal:

* The “Charles Darwin’s Library” is one of BHL’s key thematic collections. It comprises over 1,480 books owned by Charles Darwin, 430 of which have been digitised and uploaded onto the portal. Many of the titles contain Darwin’s own handwritten annotations and markings. These notes are invaluable for the clues and insights they shed on the development of Darwin’s ideas on evolution and natural selection.Lest researchers struggle to make out Darwin’s notes, BHL has provided full transcriptions of his annotations and markings.

* Another thematic collection that BHL has put together are works created by women who have made significant contributions to the study of natural history and science. “Women in Natural History” and “Early Women in Science” comprise 1,121 volumes from some 500 titles at the time of writing, and are testament to the achievements of women in the areas of botany, zoology and biodiversity.
* Titles in the paleontology collection were selected from the Vertebrate Palaeontology Library in the Smithsonian Libraries. This 506-volume collection contains close to 380 book and journal titles on physical geography, stratigraphy, systematic paleontology and paleozoology.
* The “Monsters are Real” collection features the fascinating stories, people and animals that have inspired mythical beasts and creatures such as the sea serpent, kraken, hydra, mermaid and the leviathan. This small but unique collection – with just 34 volumes from 31 titles – reveals that history’s most fearsome legendary monsters are actually based on real-life animals.
* Other notable BHL collections include “Rarest of the Rare”, which contains some of the rarest natural history works; “Antarctic Exploration & Discovery”, which comprises rare books, journals and field diaries relating to the exploration and biodiversity of the Antarctica; and the comprehensive “A History of Cats: 1858–1922” from the Library of Congress.
