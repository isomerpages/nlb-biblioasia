#### **Introduction**

As a Chinese adage goes, “the sparrow though small, has all five organs”.
Nothing could be truer than this for Tamil writing in Singapore – though
the number of Tamil literary works produced might be small compared
to other countries, Singapore’s Tamil literature is complete in its various
aspects such as heritage, genres and aesthetics. Long before Tamil writing
arrived on today’s postmodern landscape, creative migrant voices were
already heard from Singapore and drew inspiration from well-known writers
from back home in India.

The first collection of poetry from Singapore as well as the region written
in Tamil, *Munajattut Tirattu*, was printed at J. Paton Government Printer
in Singapore in 1872.1 *Singai Vartamani*, the first Tamil newspaper in the
Malay Peninsula, appeared in Singapore in 1875.2 The first anthology of
Tamil short stories, *Navarasa Katha Manjari*, was published in Singapore
in 1930.3 Singapore was the first in the world to launch, on the Internet, an anthology of poems in all four official languages, called Poemnet. In
October 1995, then-president of Singapore Ong Teng Cheong launched the
anthology *Journey: Words, Home and Nation – Anthology of Singapore Poetry
(1984–1995)* on Poemnet.4

Tamil writing in Singapore also portrays changing social realities. “Kudirai
Pandhya Lavani”, a 1893 folk-style poem about horse racing in the country,
describes lively street scenes. After Singapore became independent in 1965,
the Singapore literati grew sensitive to new realities, which was reflected in
their works of that time.

Tamils in Singapore are in the paradoxical position of being the majority
in the Indian community, but yet are a minority of the four races in
the country – this, however, is seldom reflected in their writings. The
journey of Tamil writing in Singapore is akin to travelling on a train in
broad daylight, passing by a variety of landscapes, people and postures.
Similarly, post-independence, literary writing in Tamil has met with starts
and stops. It eventually found its way in the 1970s, settled on its pace in
the 1980s and picked up swift momentum from the 1990s.

For this paper, I have restricted my study to fiction and poetry in Singapore
Tamil literature written between 1965 and 2015. The authors mentioned in
this paper have won coveted literary awards in Singapore and abroad. The
original quotes in Tamil have been listed in Appendix I.

#### **Becoming an Independent Nation**
Unlike many countries in Asia that fought bitterly for independence,
Singapore became a republic like a “bolt from blue”5 on 9 August 1965. The
country remembers the historic press conference during which founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew was in tears as he announced Singapore’s
separation from the Federation of Malaysia.

For the fledgling government, the challenges for a country with no
natural resources involved many pressing “bread and butter” issues,
including developing a robust economy and building a strong armed
forces. The determined work and far-sighted intelligence of the founding
cabinet brought about considerable improvements in the lives of many
Singaporeans. According to well-known sociologist Dr A. Veeramani, the
three major initiatives that transformed the lives of Singaporeans were
“housing, education and the rapid pace of economic growth”.6

At first, the local media and communities believed that the separation was
merely a miscommunication and that Singapore would eventually re-join
Malaysia.7 Later, as reality sank in, poets produced works praising Singapore
and its leadership.

K. Perumal produced 133 songs and poems about the new nation in
*Singapore Padalkal (Hymns on Singapore)*.8 In the book’s preface, V.T. Arasu
says, “Out and out all the songs are on Singapore. Yet the poet has not
drowned the songs on the description of the landscape and in exaggeration.

On the contrary, he points out the basic values of Singapore.”9
Paranan, a 1986 S.E.A. Write Award winner, devoted 19 out of 100 poems to
praising the republic in his collection *Thoni (Boat)*.10

National Day has been particularly inspiring for poets. During the country’s
10th anniversary, 1986 Cultural Medallion winner Na. Palanivelu wrote a
eulogy, “Kadamai” (“Duty”):

   *Ten years of independent rule<br> 
   Has made us undeniably world renowned<br> 
   Small pearl like clusters of islands fronting it<br> 
   Our Singapore emerges like a diamond radiating in all directions<br> 
   Telling for the splendour and affluence of the land<br> 
   Let us put our earnest resolve to prosper further<br> 
   This is our duty*11

Poet Naa. Aandeappan describes Singapore as a “classy diamond / in the
saline sea” in “Uyarthara Vairam” (“Classy Diamond”).12 In a similar
fashion, poet Pichinikkadu Elango symbolises “Singapore as golden plate
floating in deep sea” in his work “August 9”.13

#### **From Kampong to HDB**
As Singapore underwent rapid urbanisation, several hundred *kampong*
(village) houses were transformed into high-rise apartments. By 1962, in
just two years, the Housing Board (HD B) had built 26,168 flats, almost
equalling the number of units its predecessor, the Singapore Improvement
Trust (SIT ), built in 32 years. By the end of 1965, its tally exceeded 50,000
units.14 In only nine years, some 150,000 people had been resettled.15

For many Singaporeans, the relocation from rickety attap houses with no
electricity to concrete blocks with tiled floors was a journey from a primitive
past to a promising future; from aggravation to advantage; and from misery
to modernity.

Mayandiambalam Balakrishnan (Singai. Ma. Elangkannan), the first Tamil
writer to receive the S.E.A. Write Award in 1982, depicts the excitement of
arriving at a new flat:

   *Getting down from the taxi, Velu and Ezhilarsi looked up at the highrise<br>
   building. “Do you see a sari drying on the cloth line? At the 10th<br>
   floor? That is our house. Maragatham also got a flat close to us,” said<br>
   Muthammal, walking towards the elevator. The flat looked nice. Floors<br>
   were paved with tiles. The kitchen looked clean and neat. Peeping into<br>
   the kitchen, Velu expressed his surprise, “Is this our kitchen?”* 16
	 
Like Velu in Elangkannan’s story, many Tamil poets were excited about
the new high-rise apartments, which softened the pains of relocation.
Na. Palanivelu, recipient of the Cultural Medallion, claimed in his poems
that the old miseries had vanished like a dream when he moved into his
HD B flat.17 K.T.M. Iqbal, an eminent poet and recipient of both the S.E.A.
Write Award and Cultural Medallion, was fascinated by the cloud-kissing
skyscrapers.18 Paranan, another veteran poet, seemed even more awestruck
by tall residential flats that blocked the sun.19

C. Kumarasami, a veteran Tamil activist, describes the misery of living in
cramped quarters in “Life in Pasir Panjang”:


   *Crowded in a small space, people lived in huts in kampongs. Most<br>
   of the huts were single-room accommodations, and in many of them,<br>
   there were no kitchens. One had to cook, eat and sleep in that small<br>
   room. And there were no cots to sleep in. Every family had four or five<br>
   children. Like seeds arranged in a pod, all of them slept next to each<br>
   other. Yet efforts for procreating another child was also initiated in<br>
   that milieu*.20

Perhaps more importantly, there was less fear. The *kampongs* were rife with
gangsters, whom landlords often hired to evict tenants. Former Member
of Parliament Pathmanaban Selvadurai recounts an experience in *Bukit
Panjang: From Kampong to Town*:

I had a representative from this company – he saw me in my
branch and said, “We will help you in getting rid of the Barisan
Sosialis (an opposition political party) because all these squatters
were Barisan Sosialis supporters. If [we support them] they [will]
send in their gangsters and employ strong-arm tactics.” I had to
tell them: “Well, look, thank you very much, we are a government
party, we can’t indulge in that kind of activities. But if you give
these fellows a fair deal in terms of compensation, I will assist you,
fellows, to get [the squatters] out.” 21

Noorjahan Sulaiman also mentions the gangsters in her novel *Vergal* (*Roots*):
“In those days there were gangsters in *kampongs*, almost in every street.” 22

However, high-rise living placed new pressures on the pocket. In the
radio drama series *Aduku Veetu Annasami* (*Annasami and his Apartment*),
broadcast weekly for 52 weeks, Cultural Medallion recipient Pudumaithasan
(P. Krishnan) expressed the pinch on the wallet:

   *Santhammal: Did you notice how comfortable this house is? There is<br>
   a hall, a bathroom and kitchen. We lived in a    kampong. You were<br>
so adamant to stay there. But, now look at this place. Nice, isn’t it?*<br><br>

   *Arockiasamy: What was the rent you were paying there? Do you<br>
   remember? It was 15 dollars. And the rent here? 46.5 dollars. If you<br>
   add water and electricity charges, it would easily exceed 55 dollars*.<br><br>

   *Santhammal: This being an HDB flat, the rent is limited to 46.5<br>
   dollars. Go and check what the rent would have been had this<br>
   been a private flat; the rent would have been 80 or 100 dollars*.<br><br>

   *Arockiasami: Should comfort cost that much? Can’t that be made<br>
   available for 15 dollars?* 23
