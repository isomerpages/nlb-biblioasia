    *All is utterly changed, the map useless<br>
    for navigation in the lost city. Only an echo<br>
    remains*<br>
    – “Change Alley”, Boey Kim Cheng1

In Singapore, progress is inextricably tied up with loss – the disappearance
of landmarks and the displacement of people. This is a common theme
in Singapore literature. In his poem “Change Alley”, Boey Kim Cheng
meditates on one such site of loss, the eponymous lane that was once home
to a bazaar which ran from Raffles Place to Collyer Quay, and had been
famous for its eclectic goods and moneychangers from the early 1930s.2
Boey’s nameless speaker stands where the alley used to be, “searching still
the place / for signs leading home”. The alley’s disappearance becomes
emblematic of the wider physical and cultural erasure that accompanies
Singapore’s urban redevelopment. For Boey, composing this poem in the
1990s just as the “streets lost their names” and “the river forgot its source”,
Singaporeans were being severed from their own history.

Singapore’s growth, being limited by its tight geographical boundaries, is
to a large extent achieved through urban “renewal” projects. Even civic
landmarks, like the National Theatre (demolished in 1986) and the old
National Library (demolished in 2004), are not safe from the insatiable
need for more land and space to build high-rise homes and offices, roads,
MRT lines and other infrastructure. This has been deemed necessary both
to support a burgeoning population and to continually reinvent the city. As
Ryan Bishop, John Philips and Yeo Wei Wei explain, a city’s growth results
from “the spread of urban capitalism”; urban processes are “perpetuated
by a number of forces underpinned by the fundamentally economic ones
that govern modern existence, the locus of which is always the city”.3 For
a city-state like Singapore, urban renewal is critical to survival. Urban
planners and developers must anticipate the changing demands of the global
economy and remake the city in ever-new configurations to attract investors,
tourists and an increasingly international workforce.

But what is lost in the process? Singaporean literature has shown great
interest in engaging with this question. In Boey’s poem, for example, a city
is understood to be an organ of memory. As theorised by Mark Crinson,
redevelopment results in the effacement of this urban memory, so that the
city “can no longer act as a kind of guide or exemplar for the people living
in it”.4 The city is also the site of collective memory according to Steve Clark
– a kind of memory that can be “transferred between individuals and down
through generations”. This is of particular importance to the formation of
Singaporean identity, because “nationhood in a Singaporean context cannot
be defined through ethnicity or language […] Individuals, rather than
possessing personal recollections, are inter-connected through a distinctive
collective remembrance.”5 Singapore’s unceasing redevelopment disrupts the
accretion of this collective memory, affecting Singaporeans’ sense of identity
and history.

This essay explores how literary texts represent space and place by examining four works of Singaporean fiction that were produced after independence in the shadow of modernisation: Suchen Christine Lim’s *Fistful of Colours*, Goh Poh Seng’s *If We Dream Too Long*, and Philip Jeyaretnam’s *Raffles Place Ragtime* and *First Loves*. Spanning three decades after 1965, these works reflect a period when Singapore’s landscape underwent a dramatic transformation. While most of the current discourse about representations of space and place in Singaporean literature has focused on absence, this essay attempts to map the traces of these lost spaces and what has replaced them. As Jini Kim Watson explains, texts that foreground the built environment tell us much more than “immediate and physical changes”, as they preserve all the “competing new and old relations, ideologies, and imaginaries deposited in architectural form”.6 The four chosen texts thus map not only physical space, but also anxieties about modernity and modern life.

#### ***Fistful of Colours and If We Dream Too Long*: History, Memory and Urban Identity**

Published in 1993, Suchen Christine Lim’s novel *Fistful of Colours* is ostensibly set in a single day of the life of its protagonist Suwen, but the narrative spans multiple generations of Suwen’s family – from colonial times, through the Second World War, independence and into contemporary Singapore. While recounting these familial and national histories, Lim also documents Singapore’s urban history, giving particular attention to bygone places like pre-war Geylang and Great World Amusement Park (1929–78). Lim describes the amusement park in its heyday:

    *The Park was humming and buzzing with activities and gaiety.<br>    Within its large fenced-in enclosure were the open-air cinema,<br>    the getai or open-air stage for singing and comic sketches, the<br>    ronggeng platform for Malay dances and the Chinese opera<br>     theatre. Tucked in between the cinema, stages and theatres were<br>    numerous wooden stalls and zinc-roofed huts hawking cheap<br>    plastic wares: pails in gaudy reds and blues, utensils, toys, beads<br>    and buttons; aluminum pots and pans; poor quality clothes, towels;<br>    the minutiae of dressmaking like cards of bright buttons, reels of<br>    coloured threads, rolls of cheap satin lining, bales of cheap checks,<br>     packets of metal clips and boxes of buckles and beads. “Lelong!<br>    Lelong! Lai! Lai! Ten cents! Twenty cents only!” the hawkers called<br>     out to the housewives and their daughters milling under the glare<br>     
of the naked light bulbs and gasoline lamps*.7
