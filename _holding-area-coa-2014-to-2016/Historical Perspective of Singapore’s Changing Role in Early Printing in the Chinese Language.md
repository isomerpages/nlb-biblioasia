#### **Introduction**
From its founding in 1819, modern Singapore has been a multiracial and
multilingual society. The earliest materials printed in Singapore were in
languages such as English, Siamese, Malay, Arabic and Chinese. This
study focuses on early printing in the Chinese language, Singapore’s role
in this development and the impact it made on the Chinese language and
Chinese communities.

This essay starts with a survey of what was published during the 19th
century, followed by a review of what has been studied so far. Based on
these, I examine the changing role of Singapore as a society that enabled
early printing in the Chinese language to take shape, and how this early
availability of printing in the Chinese language impacted the multiracial
and multicultural society.
