Photography in Singapore has a long history dating back to 1843.1 The earliest photographs, or daguerrotypes, captured images on metal plates. Then, in 1851, the glass plate collodion process was introduced, which allowed photographs to be easily reproduced on albumen paper.2 This new technology was a breakthrough as it allowed photography to take off commercially.

Several photographers came into the picture to cater to this new market, such as John Thomson (1860s) and Sachtler & Co (1863–74).3 But one name dominated the 
Singapore photography scene: G. R. Lambert & Co. How Gustave Richard Lambert came to Singapore and whether he was related to the Lambert Brothers who made carriages, furniture and tombstones is unknown. The first reference to the German photographer is an announcement about his business venture on page 2 of the 11 April 1867 edition of *The Singapore Daily Times*.4

The company became hugely successful after his business partner Alexander Koch 
took over in 1885. The studio became the 
official photographer for events organised 
by the colonial government and the meetings 
of Malay sultans.5 In 1897, it added picture 
postcards to its catalogue when the postal 
service introduced this new means of communications.6
 A 1908 book, Twentieth Century 
Impressions of British Malaya, hailed G. R. 
Lambert & Co. as “the leading photographic 
artists of Singapore” with “a high reputation 
for artistic portraiture, and of landscapes… 
one of the finest collections in the East”. The 
studio sold “about a quarter of a million [post]
cards a year”,7
 and images in large format 
for use in photo albums.
Unfortunately, few such albums exist 
today. This artefact, an album dedicated to 
a Mr Vellenzer, is one rare survival. Most of
