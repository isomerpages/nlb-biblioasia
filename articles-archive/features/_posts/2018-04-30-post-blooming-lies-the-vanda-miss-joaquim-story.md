#### Is the *Vanda* Miss Joaquim a human-made hybrid or a happy accident? In this cautionary tale, **Nadia Wright, Linda Locke and Harold Johnson** recount how fiction becomes truth when it is repeated often enough.

*While doing research on the Armenian community in Singapore back in the 1990s, Australian historian Nadia Wright read an account of how the daughter of a prominent Armenian family in Singapore, Agnes Joaquim1 (Ashken Hovagimian), had stumbled upon a never-before-seen orchid bloom by accident in the family garden.*

*In the authoritative The Gardeners’ Chronicle, published on 24 June 1893, however, Henry Nicholas Ridley, the first Director of the Singapore Botanic Gardens (1888−1911) stated unequivocally that Agnes Joaquim had crossed two different orchids, the Vanda Hookeriana with the Vanda teres and produced the orchid which he later named Vanda Miss Joaquim.2 Intrigued as to why Ridley’s account had been replaced by a tale of chance discovery in various stories about the flower in Singapore, Wright decided to investigate.*

#### **The Birth of a Bloom**

In 1893, Agnes Joaquim, or possibly her brother Joe (Joaquim P. Joaquim), showed Henry Ridley a new orchid. After carefully examining the bloom, having it sketched, and preserving a specimen in the herbarium of the Botanic Gardens, Ridley sent an account of the orchid’s origin and appearance to *The Gardeners’ Chronicle*, a respected English horticulture periodical founded in 1841. He wrote:

“A few years ago Miss Joaquim, a lady residing in Singapore, well-known for her success as a horticulturist, succeeded in crossing Vanda Hookeriana, Rchb. f., and V. teres, two plants cultivated in almost every garden in Singapore. Unfortunately, no record was kept as to which was used as the male. The result has now appeared in the form of a very beautiful plant, quite intermediate between the two species and as I cannot find any record of this cross having been made before, I describe it herewith”.3

In an 1894 paper delivered to the prestigious Linnean Society in England, Ridley reiterated that *Vanda Hookeriana* had been “successfully crossed” with *V. teres, Lindl*., “producing a remarkably handsome offspring, *V. x Miss Joaquim*.” This paper was published unaltered in 1896.4  Ridley, who lived to be 100 years old, never wavered in his statement. When Isaac Henry Burkill (Ridley’s successor at the Botanic Gardens) checked all of Ridley’s herbarium specimens and redid the labels, he saw no reason to dispute Ridley and recorded Joaquim as the creator.

Ridley sent cuttings of *Vanda* Miss Joaquim to Sir Trevor Lawrence, President of the Royal Horticultural Society and one of the world’s leading orchidists, where it was nurtured in his orchid house at Burford Lodge, in Dorking, England. Flowering for the first time in Europe in 1897, *Vanda* Miss Joaquim was displayed at the Royal Horticultural Show in London, winning a First Class Certificate. In describing the event, *The Gardeners’ Chronicle* noted that “the plant was obtained from a cross between V. teres and V. Hookeriana some years ago by Miss Joaquim at Singapore”.5

In Singapore, Joaquim’s orchid debuted at the 1899 Flower Show. *The Straits Times* commented that “one of the most noticeable flowers was the orchid Vanda Miss Joaquim, named after Miss Joaquim and raised by that lady”.6 *The Singapore Free Press* confirmed Joaquim’s achievement, reporting that “Miss Joaquim showed a hybrid which has been named after her, that she has, after repeated trials, succeeded in cultivating”.7

From 1893 until 1981, the orchid was accepted, with few exceptions, as a hybrid bred by Joaquim. Robert Rolfe, editor of *The Orchid Review* and an authority on orchid hybrids, placed Vanda Miss Joaquim among the 106 cultivated hybrids created in 1893. Subsequent issues of *The Orchid Review*, *The Gardeners’ Chronicle* and other leading contemporary horticultural journals reiterated the fact that Joaquim had crossed the parent orchids, as did all the editions of the authoritative *Sander’s Complete List of Orchid Hybrids*.

#### **Sowing the First Seeds of Doubt**

In 1931, *The Straits Times* announced that a new hybrid orchid – the *Spathoglottis* Primrose – had been produced in Singapore. It was the first orchid raised using the new technique of germinating seeds in a sterile culture. This orchid was described as the second hybrid to be produced in Malaya or, as the newspaper playfully added in parentheses, “the first if *Vanda* Miss Joaquim came into being as the result of a happy accident”.8 No reason was offered for this speculation and the mischievous aside was not taken up.

Richard Eric Holttum, who was Director of the Botanic Gardens between 1925 and 1942 and again from 1946 to 1949, accepted Ridley’s description, as did his later successors Murray Ross Henderson (1949–54) and John William Purseglove (1954–57). In Hawaii, Harold Lyon (the first Director of Honolulu’s Foster Botanical Garden), who was involved with the propagation of *Vanda* Miss Joaquim there, believed Ridley.

Agnes Joaquim’s nephew Basil J.P. Joaquim, a prominent lawyer in Kuala Lumpur, corroborated Ridley’s view and was cited in*The Straits Times* in 1951 as saying “this hybrid was not discovered in the garden… [but was the result of [an] artificial pollination… performed by my unmarried aunt, Miss Agnes Joaquim”.9 Articles published in local newspapers also regarded the orchid as an artificial hybrid created by Joaquim.]
