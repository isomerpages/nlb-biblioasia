description: "The history of the tongkang industry in Singapore began with the
  arrival of Stamford Raffles in 1819. With the establishment of the island as a
  trading centre, merchants from around the region and beyond began flocking
  here. Tongkangs were the chief means of sea transport, carrying men and goods
  between South China and Nanyang. "
