The vast reservoir of knowledge resources readily available in libraries is a treasure trove waiting to be discovered and used. Its easy accessibility to the public is crucial in the pursuit of lifelong learning as well as in supporting Malaysia’s quest to become a knowledge-based society. People of all ages and social backgrounds have a soft spot and affinity for libraries and this opens up opportunities for the introduction of new services by leveraging on the rapid advances in information and communications technology (ICT) and the Internet.
	
	
The Malaysian Ubiquitous Library Pilot Project, u-Pustaka, a collaboration among eight libraries, was spearheaded by the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) as a project under the National Broadband Initiative. Its foundation and concept was based on recommendation 54 of the Knowledge-Based Economy Master Plan that states: “Review and enhance the role and contributions of museums, libraries and think tanks in lifelong learning to provide resources for learning and should be made more accessible to the majority of citizens”. Hence, the project aims to serve the public by delivering innovative library services into every household anytime and anywhere via broadband and other state-of-the-art technology.


#### **The Team**
	
	
u-Pustaka is an innovative and fitting culmination of the effort, collaboration and synergy by the Ministry of Information Communications and Culture (KPKK) through the MCMC that is supported by the National Library of Malaysia (PNM), together with the u-Pustaka Consortium members, namely, the Selangor State Library Corporation (PPAS), Negeri Sembilan State Library Corporation (PPANS), Pahang State Library Corporation (PPAP), Sarawak State Library (Pustaka), Kuala Lumpur Library (PKL), intan Library at Bukit Kiara and the Sabah State Library.

Other government agencies and private institutions also contributed towards the success of the project by offering advice, guidance and sharing of expertise during its implementation. They are the Malaysian Administrative Modernisation and Management Planning Unit (MAMPU), Economic Planning Unit (EPU), National Registration Department, Ministry of Home Affairs (JPN), National Centre of Excellence for Sensor Technology (NEST) at Universiti Putra Malaysia, Pos Malaysia Berhad (PMB), Malaysian Electronic Clearing Corporation Sdn. Bhd. (MyClear), Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad and Touch ‘n Go Sdn Bhd.
	


#### **Mission, Vision and Objectives**

The mission of u-Pustaka is to foster an engaging lifelong learning experience for an inclusive knowledge-based society in the context of 1Malaysia with the provision of Ubiquitous Library Services (u-Library) in support of the National Broadband Initiative (NBI). This is in line with its vision to ensure that the Malaysian knowledge-based society is engaged in the pursuit of lifelong learning anytime and anywhere. It also hopes to achieve continuous enhancements to the quality of work and life of Malaysians. The nation gains in terms of nation capacity building. Hence, the objectives of u-Pustaka are to make information accessible with the widening of broadband services, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology, portal technology and content; to establish a library network ecosystem to foster collaboration through inter-lending services, delivery services, e-payment services and virtual access to web publishing, content management and collaboration in expanding our capacities to innovate and create knowledge for the dividend of the nation; to create, share and exchange knowledge to keep communities connected and promote lifelong learning.
	
#### **The Challenges**

u-Pustaka is based on a model where seven components, namely broadband infrastructure; the u-Pustaka Portal; the National Union Catalogue; inter-lending; cashless payment; RFID; and the delivery channel are seamlessly integrated.
	
The eight libraries involved in the project utilise different Library Management Systems (LMS). Thus, the chosen solution has to address this scenario so that libraries in Malaysia do not have to purchase and install another system to accommodate the project. Compliance to standards such as ANSI/NISO Z39.50 and connectivity to the National Union Catalogue, a centralised database comprising over 7.2 million catalogue records from 100 contributing libraries hosted at the National Library of Malaysia, is a major requirement for the project. 
	
Participating libraries had to agree on new policies and guidelines pertaining to matters such as membership, circulation, delivery mechanism and electronic payment. The membership component leverages on MyKad/MyKid/MyPR; the delivery mechanism is entrusted to Pos Malaysia while cashless payment is handled by Touch ‘n Go and MEPS.
	
New equipment comprising RFID tagging workstations, gantries, bookdrops, auto sorters and multipurpose kiosks have been installed while rfidmiddleware has been deployed to ensure seamless integration with the existing LMS RFID-Ultra High Frequency (UHF) with spectrum release of 919-923 Mhz and Standard Interface Protocol — Version 2 (SIP2) have been adopted for the project.
	
#### **The Implementation**
	
The u-Pustaka Pilot Project took three years from its conceptualisation in 2008 to its launch in 2011. A project of this magnitude entailed many man-hours spent on initial studies, executive talks, readiness assessments, solicitation of funds, concept trials and the tender process, all of which took place between 2008 and 2009. The project kicked off in 2010 with a focus on the U-Library System development, Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) workshops, system implementation as well as promotional and awareness programmes that were carried out until 2011.
