<h3>The history of the Singapore Speedway was as fast and furious as the races it hosted.</h3><p>By Yap Jo Lin</p><p></p><p>Before the bright lights, glitz, glamour and celebrity of the Formula One Singapore Night Race, there was the Singapore Grand Prix (which started in 1961). But 30 years before that, speedsters and curious locals alike were privy to the thrills and spills of motorcycle racing at a specially constructed dirt track called the Singapore Speedway.</p><p>The Speedway had a very short life. It hosted just six races from April to June 1930 before its closure, but it marks an interesting and important chapter of Singapore’s motor-racing history. It was located at Alkaff Avenue, near the junction of Macpherson and Upper Serangoon roads, roughly where Sennett Estate is today,<a href="#_ftn1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[^1]</a> and next to Alkaff Lake Gardens, which had opened a year earlier in 1929.</p><p>News of the Speedway first broke on 3 December 1928, when the <em>Straits Times</em> reported that Australian promoter F. Heron Pitcher was in town to set up a company to run the Speedway, and that efforts were underway to identify a site.<a href="#_ftn2" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[^2]</a> Pitcher claimed to have “ample evidence” that dirt track racing would have wide and universal appeal in Singapore. “… I have no doubt that once the people see the races they will want more,” he said. “Besides having some of the greatest experts of the dirt track in the world performing on the Singapore track, opportunities will be given for local amateurs and professionals to race, for which trophies and cash prizes will be given.”<a href="#_ftn3" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[^3]</a></p><p>In the months leading up to the Speedway’s debut, another Australian came on board as managing director – a Mr. A. J. Reynolds, whose last stint was as an advertising manager for Western Australia Speedways Ltd.<a href="#_ftn4" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[^4]</a> Reynolds came to Singapore with almost three decades of experience in the entertainment and sports industries under his belt. Reynolds had a colourful past. When he was 15, Reynolds joined a troupe of acrobats touring Australia. He eventually left the troupe and received some technical training on the applications of electricity in commerce. He managed a few cinemas and several racetracks in Australia before turning his attention to racing in Singapore.<a href="#_ftn5" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[^5]</a></p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Online Only Articles/Singapore Speedway/1_A_J_Reynolds.jpg"></div><p>This sketch of Speedway managing director A. J. Reynolds accompanied a 1930 profile on Reynolds in the <em>Malaya Tribune</em>. <em>Image reproduced from</em> <em>Malaya Tribune, 14 April 1930, 19. (From NewspaperSG).</em></p><p></p><p><strong>Speedway Construction</strong></p><p>Construction of the Speedway started in February 1930 and was reported to have cost $40,000. It was spread out over 11.5 acres with an initial planned capacity of 5,000 spectators. The racetrack was 440 yards (402 metres) long and 8 inches (20 cm) thick. According to the <em>Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser</em>, the track comprised “a mixture of sand, cinders, decomposed granite, loam soil and screen [granite powder] and saturated with water, rendering it completely dustless”.<a href="#_ftn1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>[6]</u></a></p><p>The Speedway was designed by Keys and Dowdeswell, a well-known architectural firm in Singapore that had worked on Capitol Building and Capitol Theatre (both c.1930). Founding partners Percy Hubert Keys and Frank Dowdeswell had been in government service when they designed the Fullerton Building in the late 1920s (now known as the Fullerton Hotel).</p><p>The buildings at the Speedway included three octagonal ticket kiosks, a rectangular shed with seating for spectators, an enclosure for motorcyclists adjacent to the track, and men’s and women’s lavatories. There were two updates to the plans submitted for approval. The first was for the removal of a refreshment room with a bar counter, a “crush hall” or a foyer/reception area, and a manager’s office from the design. The changes might have been made to lower costs and/or accelerate the project’s completion. The second update was for additional seating along the racetrack.</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Online Only Articles/Singapore Speedway/2_1_0024_BP_474_1929.png"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Online Only Articles/Singapore Speedway/2_2_0025_BP_474_1_1929.png"></div><p>Original plans (top and above) drafted by Keys &amp; Dowdeswell in 1930 for the proposed Speedway. <em>Building Control Division Collection, courtesy of National Archives of Singapore.</em></p><p><br>As the inaugural race drew near, riders began to arrive in Singapore, some of whom had travelled by ship!<a href="#_ftn1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[7]</a> The star rider was Charles Datson. At the time, Datson had held the world two-mile record for three years and broken his own world record for the mile two years earlier in 1928.<a href="#_ftn2" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[8]</a></p><p>Each race day had two main events, each with a trophy – the Vernon Cup for amateur local riders and the Castrol Silver Gauntlet for professionals from further afield like England and Australia. While the Vernon Cup was meant for local racers, it also included riders from beyond Singapore and Malaya such as Sob Prasong from Thailand and Beppo Wahid from the Cocos Islands. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The Castrol Silver Gauntlet was designed by local jewelers B.P. De Silva and sponsored by motor oil company Castrol.<a href="#_ftn3" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[9]</a> The Vernon Cup was sponsored by Francis Vernon, a member of the Speedway’s Riders’ Club that had been formed to bring together dirt bike enthusiasts who would serve as officials during the races.<a href="#_ftn4" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[10]</a></p><p>To raise the profile of dirt track racing in Singapore, the Speedway organisers put the trophies and bikes of Datson and three other riders on display at the Borneo Motors showroom<a href="#_ftn5" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[11]</a> at Orchard Road (around Plaza Singapura today). The public was also invited to watch the riders practise at the Speedway for free.<a href="#_ftn6" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[12]</a></p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Online Only Articles/Singapore Speedway/3a_Charles_Datson.jpg"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Online Only Articles/Singapore Speedway/3b_Charles_Datson.jpg"></div><p>Champion racer Charles Datson was highly publicised in the press in the days leading up to the first Speedway race on 19 April 1930. <em>(Top)</em> <em>Image reproduced from</em> <em>Malaya Tribune, 15 April 1930, 17.

Besides running profiles of the races and race organiser A. J. Reynolds, they also featured articles about the companies and brands involved in the event. These included beverages produced by Phoenix Aerated Water Works Factory, and Osram lights installed by General Electric. There was even an entire article devoted to the Speedway’s lavatory arrangements (organisers had apparently been wondering how to cater for the huge numbers expected until GR Oehlers stepped in with their sanitary solutions).<a href="#_ftn1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>[13]</u></a></p><p><strong>Race Highlights</strong></p><p>The inaugural race day was on the eve of Easter Sunday, 19 April 1930. Ticket prices ranged from 20 cents to $2.50. The $2.50 seats were in a special section with reserved seating. Grandstand tickets were priced at $2, followed by first-class tickets at $1, second-class at 50 cents and third-class at 20 cents. A large crowd turned up that day,<a href="#_ftn1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[14]</a> including a number of cars from “up-country”, indicating that people had driven all the way from Malaysia to watch the races.<a href="#_ftn2" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[15]</a> Encouraged by the turn out, organisers added another 5,000 seats in the $1 and 50-cent sections ahead of the second race on 26 April, doubling the original planned capacity.</p><p><br></p><hr><p></p><p><br></p><hr><p></p><p></p><p><br></p><hr><p></p><hr><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><br></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><hr><p><a href="#_ftnref1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[1]</a> Location derived from comparison of Survey Department, Singapore, <em><a href="https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/maps_building_plans/record-details/f8feb2b0-115c-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Survey Map of Singapore</a></em>, 1933, map.
