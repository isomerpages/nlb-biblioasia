 <div style="background-color: white;">Debut issue of <i>Her World,</i> the first locally produced woman’s magazine for Singapore readers. <i>All rights reserved. Singapore Press Holdings, 1960.</i></div>


This year alone saw the launch of new magazines in Singapore, such as *Her World Fit & Fab* (SPH Magazines), *August Woman* (Burda Singapore), *Esquire Singapore* (Mongoose Publishing), *Nylon Singapore* (MPG Media), and *EX* (Expat Living Publications).

The *iremembermagazines* exhibition is a celebration of magazines, taking older Singaporeans down memory lane as they revisit the magazines they used to enjoy. The exhibits also offer younger Singaporeans fascinating and surprising glimpses of what life was like in days gone by.

Drawing from the National Library Legal Deposit collection, this exhibition presents the extensive variety of magazines that were published in Singapore since the 1950s, ref lecting the kaleidoscope of interests, passions, cultures, hobbies and artistic endeavours of Singaporeans through the decades. These magazines highlight too, the richness and diversity of Singapore’s social and cultural history, and the multicultural and multilingual heritage of her people. The exhibits also show how magazines have evolved over the years, vividly capturing the energy and spirit of their times.

*iremembermagazines* is a thematic series of exhibitions on Singapore magazines. It was launched with the theme of “The First Issue”, which showcases the very first issues of magazines that were published in Singapore. Some of these magazines – such as *Her World and Female* - have impressively stood the test of time and are still enjoyed by Singaporeans today, while others have ceased publication, changed publisher or title.

*Her World*, Singapore’s pioneer magazine for women, was launched in July of 1960, and continues to reign as one of the most popular and recognised magazines in Singapore today. The inaugural issue on display carries features like “Family planning in Singapore” and “What my country means to me”. From Burmese shampoo rituals, suggestions on how to dress right for campus, fiction short stories, recipes, tips on home décor to instructions on petcare, there was something for every woman – including mothers and teenage girls.

*Female* is another magazine that is still loved and enjoyed by women in Singapore today. The very colourful first issue contains interesting features on health, the vibrant styles of the 1970s, a beautiful home in Frankel Estate, and articles on motherhood and issues of working women.

The perennial interest in health is reflected way back in 1956 in the first issue of the Chinese magazine 健康生活 (*Sound Health*), which provides information on healthy living, and highlights local and international health concerns, with a focus on traditional Chinese medicine.

Published in 1959, Malay magazine *Pelita* was a platform for literary and artistic expression in Malaya, and features interesting articles on local artists and their paintings.

திைரமலர் (*Thiraimalar*), first published in 1961, was a Tamil magazine that covers film news, movie reviews and write-ups on film personalities.

Subsequent displays will highlight other themes such as beauty, style & fashion, popular culture, leisure & living, and the arts.

The magazines on display in the four official languages are truly gems of Singapore’s heritage, carefully preserved over the years. Do take this rare opportunity to view and enjoy this exhibition.
