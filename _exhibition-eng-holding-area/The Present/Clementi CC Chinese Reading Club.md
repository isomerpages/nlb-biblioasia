**About**:	Our reading club is dedicated to providing a comprehensive Chinese learning platform for Clementi residents and the broader public, with the overarching goal of promoting community-wide reading culture. Our activities encompass a rich variety of programmes designed to cater to different interests and learning styles. These include structured book discussions featuring selections from library's collection, exclusive sessions with local authors who share insights into their works and creative processes, and social outings that strengthen bonds amongst members whilst extending learning beyond traditional classroom settings. We actively collaborate with established cultural institutions, participating in NLBâ€™s initiatives, attending new book launches, and engaging with public lectures that broaden our collective understanding of literature and culture.
