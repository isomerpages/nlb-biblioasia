---
<p>In the mid-19th century, two ancient gold coins were uncovered near present-day
Keppel Harbour. Unfortunately, the Malay coins vanished before they could
be studied carefully. The Jawi inscriptions on the coins were recorded,
though they didn’t make sense. More than 180 years later, Foo Shu Tieng
tries to solve the case.</p>
