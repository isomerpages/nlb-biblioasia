#### **Introduction**
For untold centuries, the *perahu* (sailing vessels) of the Malay people plied
the waters of the Indonesian archipelago for the purposes of trade, warfare
and fishing. Yet, once the legendary Malay shippers who spread Bahasa
Melayu (the Malay language) throughout the archipelago eventually
faded from the scene, the ubiquitous *perahu* similarly disappeared from
the crowded waterways of the Straits of Malacca and beyond. This
transformation resulted largely from the policies of peninsular Malay states
that limited Malay shipping in the carrying trade or intraregional shipping
to the elites and those deemed non-threatening, thereby sending trade into a
relative decline during the 19th century.

Malays considered maritime trading in the early 19th century a highly
respectable and honorable profession. The second Resident of Singapore
John Crawfurd had recounted, “To engage in commerce is reckoned
no dishonour to anyone, but the contrary, and it is, indeed, among the
maritime tribes especially, one of the most dignified occupations even of the
sovereign himself, and of his principal officers…”1 thereby acknowledging shipping as a desirable profession for many in the archipelago. For coastal
communities, engaging in commerce offered opportunities for wealth and
respectability within society. Partaking in maritime trade, in particular, was
deemed so honourable for Malays that even sultans had trading interests.

#### **Malay Maritime Trading and Political Power**
Malay states during the early 19th century maintained a political system
dependent on the prestige of rulers, which enabled them to attract and
support followers who were necessary in order to have political power.
The peninsular Malay kingdoms came under pressure from small polities
that wished to increase their power and perhaps even become kingdoms
themselves. The mobility of other *rajas* (elites) enabled them to establish or
conquer new seats of power for themselves.2 Culturally, the *rajas* maintained
their prestige and power through the splendour of their palaces, clothing
worthy of their ranks and appropriate speech that reinforced their authority.3
The maintenance of political power in Malay states required rulers to act
appropriately to ensure sufficient political support, while failure to secure
such support possibly meant the fracturing of the state.

At the end of the 18th century, Malay shippers dominated the carrying
trade in the Straits of Malacca and adjacent waters. By 1785, Malacca had
recovered its role as the leading port in the Straits of Malacca in terms of
long-distance shipping after Dutch East India Company forces crushed the
Bugis of Riau.4 Between 1770 and 1785, Malay *nakhoda*, or vessel masters,
made up the largest nationality that commanded vessels entering Malacca.
In 1785, *nakhoda* identifying as Malay outnumbered all other ethnic groups
combined as commanders of vessels entering that port.5 Between May 1862
and April 1863, the most common “native craft” entering Malacca from
other harbours on the Malay peninsula were Malay state-flagged vessels.6 Malacca remained a bastion for Malay shipping, though its trade routes
likely changed over the decades.

With Malacca’s decreasing relevance as a trade port, its Malay shippers,
too, became less relevant over the years. Over time, sediment from erosion
silted up Malacca’s harbour, making arrivals by deep-draft Western squarerig
vessels more difficult. The town’s merchants petitioned the Straits
Settlements government in 1826 concerning this but to no avail.7 The
harbour retained its status long into the 19th century as a destination of tin
from the Malay states of Selangor and Perak, which arrived in small perahu.8
Without a deep-water harbour for much of the 19th century, Malacca stood
no chance against other regional ports, such as Singapore, that facilitated
international trade more efficiently.

On the trading rivalry between Penang and Singapore, Robert Fullerton’s
statement of 26 July 1825 noted, “the Government [will have] nothing
to do with the mercantile jealousy of either and must look to the general
interests of all, and because I think both are eminently useful…”.9
Fullerton argued that Singapore and Penang would each draw trade from
the surrounding region mainly at the expense of foreign ports nearby
rather than each other, with Malacca likely attracting trade from ports
located immediately within the Straits of Malacca such as Siak. From the
Straits Settlements, goods usually went on to distant major markets.10
The Indian and Straits Settlements governments’ policies of focusing on
Singapore and Penang relegated Malacca to a small harbour receiving
goods from only its nearby neighbours. Even though these policies
disproportionately affected Malay shippers, the Straits government sought
to avoid preferential treatment for them or create laws to mitigate their
effects to legitimise their rule. The Straits Settlements sought to attract
shipping from other lands more so than developing a local merchant fleet
to engage in trade throughout the Indian archipelago.

While the Straits Settlements were functionally indifferent to the plight of
the Malay shipper, Malay states were usually hostile toward independent
Malay shippers due to fears of concentrated wealth challenging their power.
Malay rulers employed their wealth as a means to attract Malay subjects who
possessed a great deal of mobility and reserved the right to move elsewhere.
This system, known as* kerajaan* economics, enabled Malay rulers to use
wealth to attract followers and seize the wealth of potential rivals whose
properties enabled them to challenge established authorities by attracting
followers of their own or incorporating them into their state.11 Given the
importance of the shipping industry to the Malay peninsula and the wealth
it generated, an independent Malay merchant class potentially threatened
the power of the Malay ruling elite.

#### **Malay States and Monopolies**

The shipping industry in the Malay states during the 19th century operated
largely via royal monopolies. In his 1820 work on the Indian Archipelago,
John Crawfurd noted the rarity of regular duties implemented by Malay
governments that instead used commercial monopolies, observing that “[a]
Malay prince is … in general the first and often the only merchant in his
country.”12 Foreigners obtained trading rights by gaining permission to do
so from the local ruler in exchange for gifts. During this time, certain ports
retained fairly open trading policies, which Crawfurd ascribed especially
to states where “Arabs and their descendants [had] obtained sovereignty,”
along with places where an effective *shahbandar* (an official specialising in
mercantile and foreign affairs) managed the harbour, such as in Malacca,
Palembang and Aceh.13 In the first two decades of the 19th century, there
remained successful Malay ports, while the archipelago also had systems
based on royal monopolies and trading privileges.

While sailing along the east coast of Malaya during the early 1830s, George
Windsor Earl, a British adventurer, noted the existence of commercial
monopolies that were held by the governments there. During his stay in
Terengganu in 1833, Earl described the government as an aristocracy with
the sultan as the nominal authority elected by the *pangerans*, or noble lords. 

They surrounded themselves with dependents who shunned “honest” work.
“The Sultan and the *pangerans* form a sort of commercial company, and
monopolize [sic] the whole of foreign trade,” described Earl who also noted
they required locals to buy solely from them.14 Earl, in contrast to Crawfurd,
depicted Arabs and their laws as a negative influence on Malay society.15 The
monopolistic system controlled by Malay elites ensured that no potential
political challenger arose from the masses and that the state’s wealth was
kept for themselves and their supporters. The monopolisation of foreign
shipping rights by the elite inhibited the rise of independent merchants.
