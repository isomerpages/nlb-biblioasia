**About**:	Hanlin Reading Club was established on 26 October 2003 as an activity group under Singapore's Joo Chiat Community Club, with a dedicated mission to promote cultural appreciation and cultivate reading habits within the community. Since its inception, the club has developed a comprehensive programme of cultural and literary activities designed to engage diverse audiences and foster intellectual growth. The club's offerings include public lectures featuring distinguished speakers, cultural competitions that celebrate literary knowledge, intimate book discussion sessions, poetry and prose recitations, Chinese language courses for learners at various levels, and exclusive new book launch events. 
Beyond its own programming, Hanlin Reading Club actively collaborates with other organisations and participates in broader cultural initiatives, including the annual World Book Day celebrations.
