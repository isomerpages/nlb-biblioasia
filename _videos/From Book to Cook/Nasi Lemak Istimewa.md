#### **Episode summary** ####
In this episode, we make an unusual version of nasi lemak using a recipe from 1953. The recipe comes from book by Siti Radhiah, an early female Malay cookbook author. Is it really *nasi lemak* if it doesn’t use pandan? Join librarian and food researcher Toffa Abdul Wahed as we find out!

#### **Recipes**
Toffa made Siti Radhiah's recipes of *nasi lemak berkukus dengan lauk-pauknya* (steamed *nasi lemak* and its accompaniments), which were originally published in Jawi in 1953.

<br>**English translation by Toffa of *nasi lemak berkukus dengan lauk-pauknya* (Steamed nasi lemak and its accompaniments)** 
<br><u>*Nasi lemak berkukus*</u>
<br>2 *kati* (~1210 g) Thai rice
<br>2 coconuts
<br>Salt

Rice is cooked with some thin coconut milk in a steamer. Then, remove it and pour in salted thick coconut milk and stir. Steam again until cooked. If you like it fragrant, add a few bay leaves or lemongrass.
 
Its accompaniments are thinly sliced cucumber, fried anchovies, and chicken eggs or duck eggs made into omelette. *Kacang putih* is soaked first and then fried, or fried peanuts. Red onions and chillies are sliced thinly and fried. Chicken or meat opor. Sambal goreng and serunding.  

<u>*Opor ayam*</u> 
<br>1 chicken
<br>½ tbsp. coriander seeds
<br>½ tsp. white pepper
<br>A pinch of salt
<br>3 cloves garlic
<br>10 red onions
<br>10 candlenuts
<br>A thumb-sized piece of ginger
<br>A bit of galangal
<br>1 coconut
<br>3 bay leaves
<br>Some lemongrass

Coriander seeds, salt and white pepper are ground together. Then, add garlic, candlenuts, galangal, ginger and red onions. Grind them until fine. All of the spices (*rempah*) are sautéd (*tumis*) with a bit of coconut oil. Then, add bay leaves, lemongrass and chicken that has been cleaned and chopped up, and stir. When most of the liquid has dried up, add coconut milk. If the gravy is quite thick and the chicken is tender,  remove from the stove.

<u>*Sambal goreng*</u> 
<br>½ *kati* (~303 g) meat 
<br>4 tbsp. sliced red onions
<br>4 slices of ginger
<br>A bit of sliced lemongrass
<br>4 cloves garlic, sliced
<br>½ tspn. shrimp paste
<br>A bit of granulated sugar
<br>15 red chillies, thinly sliced (dried chillies can also be used)
<br>4 tofu, sliced
<br>Salt 
<br>A bit of tamarind

Meat is cut into small pieces, cleaned well, then fried. Red onions, garlic, ginger, lemongrass are sautéd with cooking oil until yellowish. Then, add the dried chillies that have been sliced thinly, and stir. Add meat that has been fried and tofu that has been cut and fried earlier. Add shrimp paste, and a bit of salt and sugar and tamarind juice. If you like, add some *pati santan* (coconut milk that has been extracted without adding any water), and stir until dry and remove. Some people also like making this *sambal goreng* with tempeh and long beans that are sliced thinly.
