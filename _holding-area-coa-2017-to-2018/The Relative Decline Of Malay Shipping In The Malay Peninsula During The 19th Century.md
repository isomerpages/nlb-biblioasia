#### **Introduction**
For untold centuries, the *perahu* (sailing vessels) of the Malay people plied
the waters of the Indonesian archipelago for the purposes of trade, warfare
and fishing. Yet, once the legendary Malay shippers who spread Bahasa
Melayu (the Malay language) throughout the archipelago eventually
faded from the scene, the ubiquitous *perahu* similarly disappeared from
the crowded waterways of the Straits of Malacca and beyond. This
transformation resulted largely from the policies of peninsular Malay states
that limited Malay shipping in the carrying trade or intraregional shipping
to the elites and those deemed non-threatening, thereby sending trade into a
relative decline during the 19th century.

Malays considered maritime trading in the early 19th century a highly
respectable and honorable profession. The second Resident of Singapore
John Crawfurd had recounted, “To engage in commerce is reckoned
no dishonour to anyone, but the contrary, and it is, indeed, among the
maritime tribes especially, one of the most dignified occupations even of the
sovereign himself, and of his principal officers…”[^1] thereby acknowledging shipping as a desirable profession for many in the archipelago. For coastal
communities, engaging in commerce offered opportunities for wealth and
respectability within society. Partaking in maritime trade, in particular, was
deemed so honourable for Malays that even sultans had trading interests.

#### **Malay Maritime Trading and Political Power**
Malay states during the early 19th century maintained a political system
dependent on the prestige of rulers, which enabled them to attract and
support followers who were necessary in order to have political power.
The peninsular Malay kingdoms came under pressure from small polities
that wished to increase their power and perhaps even become kingdoms
themselves. The mobility of other *rajas* (elites) enabled them to establish or
conquer new seats of power for themselves.[^2] Culturally, the *rajas* maintained
their prestige and power through the splendour of their palaces, clothing
worthy of their ranks and appropriate speech that reinforced their authority.[^3]
The maintenance of political power in Malay states required rulers to act
appropriately to ensure sufficient political support, while failure to secure
such support possibly meant the fracturing of the state.

At the end of the 18th century, Malay shippers dominated the carrying
trade in the Straits of Malacca and adjacent waters. By 1785, Malacca had
recovered its role as the leading port in the Straits of Malacca in terms of
long-distance shipping after Dutch East India Company forces crushed the
Bugis of Riau.[^4] Between 1770 and 1785, Malay *nakhoda*, or vessel masters,
made up the largest nationality that commanded vessels entering Malacca.
In 1785, *nakhoda* identifying as Malay outnumbered all other ethnic groups
combined as commanders of vessels entering that port.[^5] Between May 1862
and April 1863, the most common “native craft” entering Malacca from
other harbours on the Malay peninsula were Malay state-flagged vessels.[^6] Malacca remained a bastion for Malay shipping, though its trade routes
likely changed over the decades.

With Malacca’s decreasing relevance as a trade port, its Malay shippers,
too, became less relevant over the years. Over time, sediment from erosion
silted up Malacca’s harbour, making arrivals by deep-draft Western squarerig
vessels more difficult. The town’s merchants petitioned the Straits
Settlements government in 1826 concerning this but to no avail.[^7] The
harbour retained its status long into the 19th century as a destination of tin
from the Malay states of Selangor and Perak, which arrived in small perahu.[^8]
Without a deep-water harbour for much of the 19th century, Malacca stood
no chance against other regional ports, such as Singapore, that facilitated
international trade more efficiently.

On the trading rivalry between Penang and Singapore, Robert Fullerton’s
statement of 26 July 1825 noted, “the Government [will have] nothing
to do with the mercantile jealousy of either and must look to the general
interests of all, and because I think both are eminently useful…”.[^9]
Fullerton argued that Singapore and Penang would each draw trade from
the surrounding region mainly at the expense of foreign ports nearby
rather than each other, with Malacca likely attracting trade from ports
located immediately within the Straits of Malacca such as Siak. From the
Straits Settlements, goods usually went on to distant major markets.[^10]
The Indian and Straits Settlements governments’ policies of focusing on
Singapore and Penang relegated Malacca to a small harbour receiving
goods from only its nearby neighbours. Even though these policies
disproportionately affected Malay shippers, the Straits government sought
to avoid preferential treatment for them or create laws to mitigate their
effects to legitimise their rule. The Straits Settlements sought to attract
shipping from other lands more so than developing a local merchant fleet
to engage in trade throughout the Indian archipelago.

While the Straits Settlements were functionally indifferent to the plight of
the Malay shipper, Malay states were usually hostile toward independent
Malay shippers due to fears of concentrated wealth challenging their power.
Malay rulers employed their wealth as a means to attract Malay subjects who
possessed a great deal of mobility and reserved the right to move elsewhere.
This system, known as* kerajaan* economics, enabled Malay rulers to use
wealth to attract followers and seize the wealth of potential rivals whose
properties enabled them to challenge established authorities by attracting
followers of their own or incorporating them into their state.[^11] Given the
importance of the shipping industry to the Malay peninsula and the wealth
it generated, an independent Malay merchant class potentially threatened
the power of the Malay ruling elite.

#### **Malay States and Monopolies**

The shipping industry in the Malay states during the 19th century operated
largely via royal monopolies. In his 1820 work on the Indian Archipelago,
John Crawfurd noted the rarity of regular duties implemented by Malay
governments that instead used commercial monopolies, observing that “[a]
Malay prince is … in general the first and often the only merchant in his
country”.[^12]  Foreigners obtained trading rights by gaining permission to do
so from the local ruler in exchange for gifts. During this time, certain ports
retained fairly open trading policies, which Crawfurd ascribed especially
to states where “Arabs and their descendants [had] obtained sovereignty,”
along with places where an effective *shahbandar* (an official specialising in
mercantile and foreign affairs) managed the harbour, such as in Malacca,
Palembang and Aceh.[^13] In the first two decades of the 19th century, there
remained successful Malay ports, while the archipelago also had systems
based on royal monopolies and trading privileges.

While sailing along the east coast of Malaya during the early 1830s, George
Windsor Earl, a British adventurer, noted the existence of commercial
monopolies that were held by the governments there. During his stay in
Terengganu in 1833, Earl described the government as an aristocracy with
the sultan as the nominal authority elected by the *pangerans*, or noble lords. 

They surrounded themselves with dependents who shunned “honest” work.
“The Sultan and the *pangerans* form a sort of commercial company, and
monopolize [sic] the whole of foreign trade,” described Earl who also noted
they required locals to buy solely from them.[^14] Earl, in contrast to Crawfurd,
depicted Arabs and their laws as a negative influence on Malay society.[^15] The
monopolistic system controlled by Malay elites ensured that no potential
political challenger arose from the masses and that the state’s wealth was
kept for themselves and their supporters. The monopolisation of foreign
shipping rights by the elite inhibited the rise of independent merchants.

#### **Singapore’s Trade with the East Coast of Malaya**
Given the maritime trading needs of the inhabitants of the Malay Peninsula,
along with the nature of Malay politics, shipping played an important role
in the economies of the east coast of Malaya. Seafarers plied these waters
with vessels known as *sampan-pukats*, loading cargo from the states of
Pahang, Terengganu and Kelantan to Singapore for distribution elsewhere.[^16]
Earl described one such vessel as “a long open boat” capable of fending off
pirate attacks, which, in his experience, had a crew of around 35.[^17] These
vessels formed an integral part of the trade that enabled goods from the east
coast of Malaya to be transported elsewhere for consumption, and eventually
dominated the carrying trade.

Trade between Singapore and the Malayan east coast slumped during the
mid-1830s but managed to recover by the end of the decade. From around
1834 to 1837, commerce between the east coast of Malaya and Singapore
experienced a trading slump (see Figure 1) that forced the industry to
undertake reforms. Pirate attacks, misconduct of officers and excessive
supply all contributed to the decline in trade. During the early 1830s, there
were 14 or 15 *sampan-pukat* that sailed between Singapore and East Malaya.
This dropped to four for most of 1836. By the start of 1837, that number had rebounded to eight vessels and looked set for further growth.[^18] Such
volatility required adequate organisation and support to fend off pirates and
rebuild after potentially devastating losses from their attacks.[^19]

<div style="background-color: white;"><center>Fig. 1 East Malaya’s trade with Singapore</center></div>

The organisational restructuring of the trade culminated with Chinese
merchants dominating the export trade of the Malayan east coast. “The
few Chinese merchants”… who … “exclusively managed” the Singapore-
Malayan east coast trade became more cautious, selecting *nakhoda* they
trusted because of their “character and experience,” and who possessed some
capital.[^20] Singapore’s merchant community reformed ensuring those engaged
in the trade were responsible for losses rather than external creditors,
thereby forcing greater caution onto the shipping industry. With piracy in
sharp decline after 1836, the trade of gold dust, tin and pepper from East
Malaya to Singapore recovered.[^21] The trading reforms hardened the resolve of merchants and seafarers to ensure the success of trading missions. With
each *nakhoda* personally vested in the voyage, the odds of success increased
as surrendering cargo to either pirates or other causes became less desirable.
Seafarers became less likely to give up when their livelihoods were at stake.
With creditors no longer footing the losses of Singapore merchant traders,
the latter became more careful with whom they selected to safeguard their
investments. Chinese merchants in Singapore possibly preferred *nakhoda* of
their own ethnicity or dialect rather than Malays or other groups, thereby
weakening them.

#### **Straits Chinese Merchants**

For the Straits Chinese, working with people they trusted, such as family
and those of a similar ethnic background, meant smoother business
transactions. European newcomers moving to Penang would hire Chinese
contractors to construct their homes for them. These contractors in turn
offered referrals to their relatives who could provide furniture, clothing and
servants, or services such as regularly purchasing food for the household
in exchange for a monthly payment.[^22] Though such methods increased
efficiency and united families economically, they also kept non-relatives and
other ethnic groups out of particular sectors of the Malayan economy and
exacerbated wealth gaps.

By 1837, the trade between the Malayan east coast and Singapore, then
dominated by Chinese, had only a few Malay shippers. The east coast’s
exports to Singapore were “…almost entirely imported by Chinese
*pukats* – a comparatively small portion of the trade being in the hands of
the Malays themselves”.[^23] The writer explains that this resulted from “…
the wretched policy which prevails in all these petty native states, where
the Rajah himself is generally the principal trader, and almost always a
monopolist. Each of these *pukats* generally carries twenty-nine men, all
Chinese, who compose a partnership among themselves, every individual
on board being interested, some more, some less, in the general result of
the whole adventure, and no one among them being paid anything under the name of wages”.[^24] The crew usually comprised 26 common seafarers
and three officers, who consisted of the *nakhoda*, clerk and business agent
or sometimes just the *nakhoda* himself. However, the Chinese merchants in
port “almost always” owned the vessels, rather than the crew, and managed
them from Singapore, while significant creditors of the vessel often owned a
stake in the cargo.[^25] The Chinese, based in Singapore, effectively controlled
shipping to the east coast of Malaya from the *sampan-pukat* owners down
to the regular seafarers who manned the vessels and owned cargo. Chinese
shippers surpassed their Malay counterparts in trade mainly because
policies of Malay states favoured them.

Why did Malay rulers permit Chinese merchants to engage in commerce
when they excluded others from doing so? As Crawfurd explained
concerning the carrying trade of the Indian Archipelago: “The peaceable,
unambitious, and supple character of the Chinese, and the conviction on the
part of the native governments, of their exclusive devotion to commercial
pursuits, disarm all jealousy, and make them welcome guests everywhere.
This very naturally and very justly gives them an equitable monopoly of
the carrying trade…”.[^26] Granting trading monopolies to Chinese merchant
syndicates appeared to Malay rulers as the politically safest option because
of their apparent lack of political ambition. Even if a Chinese leader sought
political power, the leader would almost certainly have had difficulty gaining
the loyalty of Malay subjects, especially if he did not adopt Malay customs
and Islam.

The leadership of these Malayan-Chinese communities were also officials
who governed affairs within the Malay states. The formal leader of the
Chinese community in Malay state systems became known as the “*kapitan*
China,” evolving from the Malacca Sultanate position of *shahbandar*.
After the Portuguese conquered Malacca in 1511, they adapted the
position to a more militaristic role by mobilising and leading troops
from a particular community. The Dutch and Malay states borrowed the
title of “*kapitan*” and offered it to Chinese community leaders for their
respective governments.[^27] The *kapitan* China and his followers supported the Malay ruling elite, while Chinese merchants received either commercial
monopolies or favourable trading terms. The relationship between the
Chinese merchant community and Malay rulers functioned by splitting
wealth and power between themselves. Though this relationship proved
untenable at times and in certain places, it persisted long enough to
undercut the market share growth of Malay shippers that was critical during
a long growth period.

#### **Power, Politics and Malay Merchants**

The Malay political leadership saw Malay merchants as potential threats
to their power, which made them prefer non-Malays as state-sanctioned
merchants. Despite their fame throughout the archipelago and beyond,
Malay maritime traders in peninsular Malay states lacked the same status
for much of the 19th century. Prior to the late 18th century, the Malay
Peninsula had fewer prominent Malay traders in comparison with other
ethnic groups, because Malay merchants operated from other ports in
Southeast Asia instead. The peninsular Malay states likely preferred non-
Malay merchants to conduct trade.[^28]

Malay *rajas* so feared wealthy Malays, especially traders, that they developed
policies to prevent their rise because of the way in which wealthy Malays
obtained power.[^29] Frank Swettenham, a British official, frequently witnessed
the loss of property by seizure during the 19th century in Malaya, which
he partially accounted for the socio-economic problems there.[^30] Aside from
a lack of security from theft, Malay commoners lost their wealth to the
*kerajaan* system, which prevented the rise of political opponents. The Malay
states permitted Chinese communities to accumulate wealth through their
own legal system because they were perceived as outsiders. Engaging in
commerce meant working for the ruler or having status within the political
hierarchy.[^31] Wealthy Malay traders stood to face political problems if they
wanted to live on the Malay Peninsula because of the political barriers
erected by the Malay states.

Arab merchants often worked within Malay political structures and
perceptions to secure a place within the shipping industry of Malaya. Arab
shipping merchants often received special privileges from Malay *rajas*,
making Arab merchants less vulnerable to their whims than Malays. While
at Pahang, Munshi Abdullah noted that the Arabs there were all merchants
who lived near *Kampong* China and were revered by Malays as *rajas* and
were treated as such having come from the Holy Land.[^32] Aside from
developing relationships with the Malay states, Arab merchants such as
Syed Massim bin Salleh Al Jeoffrie settled in Singapore while owning large
sailing vessels and steamers to conduct trade in the archipelago.[^33] Straits
Arab traders had advantages over their Malay counterparts because of
their more favourable relationships with Malay rulers. These relationships
allowed them to develop their own shipping networks and prosper, which
in turn enabled them to acquire more sophisticated shipping technology as
the century progressed and permitted them to remain competitive in the
shipping industry.

#### **The Rise of Free Trade**

Singapore adopted free trade policies that empowered regional merchants,
who in turn became more resilient to the demands of Malay *rajas*. Sir
Stamford Raffles ordered Singapore’s first resident, William Farquhar, not
to impose tariffs on Singapore’s commerce when they established a factory
there in 1819. Traders flocked to Singapore, drawn by the promises of no
tariffs and low port fees. The Malay *rajas* in Singapore demanded gifts from
the *nakhoda* but by April 1820, with Raffles’ reforms, the *nakhoda* had won
the right not to offer gifts to them.[^34] This remained a thorny issue in 1821
when Sultan Husain ordered a junk master from Amoy, China to be placed
in the stocks for failing to provide him with a gift, though the junk master
was freed by Resident Farquhar shortly after.[^35] Governor Robert Fullerton
pushed the Straits Settlements even further toward free trade by eliminating fees for *perahu* and junks visiting Penang in December 1826.[^36] The new
free trade policies enabled foreign merchants to resist more effectively the
demands of government officials. Foreign merchants, especially those from
China, sailing the trading routes from the Straits Settlements to the Malay
states, became increasingly assertive in their relationship with governments.

Mercantile shipping became a powerful force within the Straits Settlements
that promoted and used liberal policies to its advantage. Malay shippers
from throughout the archipelago sailed to Singapore to trade. According
to Governor Blundell of the Straits Settlements in 1856, Malay shippers
particularly enjoyed the policies of free trade, not so much because of the
monetary benefits, but rather for the lack of government interference. The
corruption of customs houses throughout the archipelago, practised by local
rulers and Europeans alike, so frustrated Malay shippers that Singapore’s less
corrupt system attracted them, because they knew they did not need to pay
a customs house.[^37] Within Singapore itself, however, Malay shippers owned
just three schooners totaling 149 tonnes out of Singapore’s registry of 29,573
tonnes of Western square-rig shipping – less than one percent of the total
tonnage at one point during the mid-1850s.[^38] Though Singapore became a
popular destination for shipping throughout the archipelago, few Malays
registered any Western-style vessels there. Without acquiring these vessels,
keeping up with long-term shipping trends became increasingly difficult.

In the face of a trading environment determined by Britain’s economic
liberalism, some Malay states outside the peninsula were more adept at
protecting their shipping industries from foreign firms than their peninsular
compatriots. Sumatran Malay states, such as Kampar and Siak, prospered
from trade with Singapore by sending convoys of 12 to 20 *perahu*, each
with a crew numbering between 20 and 30, as part of the Malay-Arab
elite’s commercial enterprises. Malays held the Kampar-Singapore route
with *nakhoda* renting vessels from the ruling elite at a tonnage rate of $30
for a 20-tonne *perahu* in Kampar. After selling goods in Singapore, they purchased cargo and returned home.[^39] Malay *nakhoda* and crews all owned
a portion of the cargo and had no substantive Chinese competition in the
1830s because of the latter’s absence in Kampar.[^40] In the early 20th century,
the royals from Pulau Penyengat purchased a steamship to ferry goods from
the Riau Archipelago to Singapore.[^41] Malays outside the Malay Peninsula
shipped goods to Singapore even into the 20th century despite, or perhaps
because of, the liberal shipping policies enacted by the Straits Settlements.

#### **Winds of Change**
Siam’s littoral political economy was remarkably similar to the peninsular
Malay states. Like the Malay states, much of Siam’s economy consisted of
monopolies owned by Siamese lords, or *senabodi*. When King Mongkut
of Siam decided on substantive economic reforms, he received the support
of the Bunnag family, merchants who were of Iranian decent and were the
wealthiest and most powerful trading family in the kingdom. One family
member, Chuang Bunnag, disliked the old system because taxes oppressed
the poor and limited the goods available for export. Chuang Bunnag
sought British support to remove the entrenched power structures through
the Bowring Treaty (signed in 1855 between Great Britain and Siam to
facilitate greater trade among other issues).[^42] The Siamese had a system akin
to the Malay *kerajaan* economics structure and used British influence to
undermine the previous system. Unlike the Malay *rajas*, Siam transformed
its economy without sacrificing its sovereignty but at the cost of its previous
economic and political policies.

Maritime development exemplified the increasing sophistication of the
central state and the power of the king. Siam removed its previous economic
restrictions and reformed the kingdom, allowing for economic expansion,
which enabled the government to expand its naval power. King Mongkut’s reign saw the first steam vessels used by a Siamese government. The new
steam vessels increased the prestige of the monarchy, while proving useful
for naval patrols and various government functions. Additionally, the
Siamese government constructed new sailing vessels as part of its building
programme during the 1850s. Eventually, both government- and civilianowned
steam vessels became more common in Siamese waters, with even
Chinese merchants there acquiring steam vessels.[^43] The acquisition of steam
vessels and the development of Siam’s shipping industry during the second
half of the 19th century required a degree of political centralisation and
economic reform.

The peninsular Malay states faced similar trade headwinds with the rise
of free trade and more powerful merchants independent of state control.
Under the monopolistic system, Malay rulers employed their authority and
monopolies to acquire goods from their people at below market-value rates
and then sold the goods to foreign merchants. For instance, the *temenggong*
in Singapore purchased *agar-agar*, a type of seaweed, as per tradition at
$6 for 12 *pikuls*, even though its market prices ranged from $30 to $40.[^44] 
The Malay elites then sold the goods they received at much higher prices.
A monopoly on foreign trade resulted in higher prices than if foreigners
bought the goods directly from producers. The Straits Settlements’ free trade
system undermined such monopolies because foreign merchants became
less willing to accept higher prices. This in turn eroded *kerajaan* revenues
and contributed to political instability in Malaya because the rulers lacked
funds to support their political bases.[^45] By 1837, the sultan of Kelantan
had adopted “a more liberal system of trade” than other rulers in Malaya,
attracting more merchants to his harbour by avoiding a monopolistic trade
system.[^46] Malay states came under new economic pressures with *kerajaan*
economics becoming less feasible in the face of free trade.

The peninsular Malay rulers came under heavy pressure to reform their
revenue systems and move away from the monopolistic aspects of *kerajaan* economics by foreign merchants but such a transition caused great
challenges. The *bendahara* (chief minister) of Pahang attempted to keep a
foreign trade monopoly by compelling the *sampan-pukat* shippers to trade
only with him. The domestic industry suffered as Chinese gold and tin
miners went on strike and later fled rather than accept the *raja*’s conditions.
Eventually, the *bendahara* moved from a monopoly-based system to one
reliant more on heavy customs duties.[^47] Kelantan experienced dissent
from Chinese miners during this period, though their motivations were
murky. Chinese miners had killed the *temenggong* of Kelantan at Pulai,
Kelatan, supposedly at the instigation of another Malay chief. However,
the *temenggong*’s son avenged his father’s death by slaughtering the Chinese
miners there.[^48] Though the miners’ motives for resorting to violence remains
unclear, the incident suggested that liberalising commerce exacerbated the
inter-factional violence within the Malay states. The economic changes of
the 19th century shook the foundations of the *kerajaan* economics system
found in the Malay Peninsula, particularly as foreigners gained more power
within Malay states and used *kerajaan* economics to their advantage.

In contrast, Siam was able to take better advantage of the situation brought
on by liberalisation, perhaps because of its closer cooperation with locally
based mercantile elites, whereas peninsular Malay states lacked sufficient
strength and internal cooperation and cohesiveness to adapt. Shipping
merchants once deemed non-threatening became too powerful to control
by either the Straits Settlements or Malay states resulting in Malay shipping
losing its former market share. Despite the significance of the industry, few,
if any, regional governments seemed interested in protecting Malay shippers.
The competition became too fierce for Malays shippers, save a few elites,
to participate in the steam shipping industry by the close of the century.
The Siamese centralised their political power and adapted new maritime
technologies more successfully than their peninsular Malay counterparts
who took considerably less action in developing their maritime capacity
along Western lines.

Despite overwhelming odds and a challenging political environment,
Hajjah Fatimah binte Sulaiman, a peninsular Malay shipping merchant, emerged during the 19th century and set up a successful shipping firm.
Fatimah was from a prominent family in Malacca. Her first marriage
failed and she moved to Singapore to start afresh.[^49] Fatimah employed her
connections with the *rajas* of the peninsular Malay states in her trading and
married a Bugis prince from Gowa and bore a child named Raja Siti. With
Fatimah’s abilities and political connections, she developed a trading fleet
of numerous *perahu* and other vessels that sailed the waters of Malaya and
the archipelago.[^50] Her daughter subsequently married the son of an Arab
merchant in Singapore, who eventually took over her business. The business
survived two robberies and a fire, after which the family built a mosque
on Beach Road in Singapore where they held feasts for Muslims of all
backgrounds twice a year.[^51] Fatimah, though independent of Malay rulers,
likely obtained success through her relationships with them and having royal
support from her husband’s family. Perhaps Malay *rajas* had dismissed her
as a threat because of her gender, but, in any case, she managed a shipping
firm that eventually assimilated into the cosmopolitan Islam of Singapore,
where non-Malay Muslims, including the overseas Arab community into
which her daughter married, thrived.

Munshi Abdullah described the policies of Malay rulers in a manner that fit
the framework of *kerajaan* economics well. After witnessing the destitution
of Pahang during his voyage in 1838, he considered the reasons for such
poverty and determined that the “oppression and cruelty of the *rajas*”
caused such hardship that people gave up trying to obtain wealth because
the *rajas* seized anything of value.[^52] He made similar assertions about the
corruption of Malay rule concerning Terengganu. For commoners, staying
poor became a survival strategy because if a man obtained anything, the *raja*
would usually demand a gift or loan. If anyone resisted, the *raja* would likely
kill the resistors and their families.[^53] In Kelantan, a man reported a situation
where *rajas* had seized homes and slaughtered those who disobeyed them.[^54]
Munshi Abdullah determined that the causes of poverty in Malay states came down to a lack of peace and security for subjects and their properties,
where the elites perpetually mistreated their people by seizing their
properties and killing them. As a result, the Malays lacked any incentive to
develop the land and stayed idle.[^55] Such analysis by Munshi Abdullah and
others reflect the concept of *kerajaan* economics. Malay elites monopolised
the economic capacity of a state out of fear that a leader might become
strong enough to challenge them and destroy the elite’s hold on power.

The peninsular Malay states sent the Malay carrying trade into a relative
decline through policies that favoured the Malay ruling elites and their
political allies who they had deemed as less threatening during the 19th
century. We can still see visual evidence of this in 21st century Singapore
through the two old Malay quarters of Kampong Gelam and Telok Blangah,
each of which possessed its own Malay ruler separated by the formerly
bustling Singapore River. The Istana Kampong Gelam once housed the
royal family that ruled from Singapore. Its neighbourhood remains a
testament to the Islamic cosmopolitanism of Singapore with streets names
that echo the distant cities of Baghdad, Kandahar and Muscat. Though the
neighbourhood has changed much since the 19th century, it still hosts shops
akin to those in the past. Hardly any evidence of the once thriving Malay
village at Telok Blangah remains, save for Masjid Temenggong Daeng
Ibrahim and its adjacent cemetery, where the ancestors and relatives of the
current Sultan of Johor lie. Despite the *rajas* of Telok Blangah ultimately
attaining greater wealth than the royal family at Kampong Gelam, the
former Malay village has lost nearly any semblance of its former life.
*Kerajaan* economics prevented ordinary Malays from obtaining great wealth
in Telok Blangah. The residents of Kampong Gelam, however, had more
economic opportunities largely because of the different policies enacted by
authorities there. This contrast is just one example of the enduring legacy of
*kerajaan* economics, when rulers stifled Malay enterprise.
