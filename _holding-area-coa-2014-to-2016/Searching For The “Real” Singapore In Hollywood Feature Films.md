#### **Introduction**
In January 1936, an article in *The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile
Advertiser* remarked that with so many American filmmakers arriving
on local shores, “Singapore is becoming the equatorial Hollywood”.1
Two months later, an editorial in the same newspaper entitled “The
Film Invasion” described the “invasion of film people from Hollywood”
including “such famous names as Frank Buck, Ward Wing, Tay Garnett,
James A. Fitzpatrick, and Percy Marmont, to say nothing of Charlie
Chaplin”.2 It should be no surprise that the American film industry had
such a strong impression of Singapore, which, as a major port in the British
Empire, had gained a reputation for being the “Charing Cross of the East”
and “Clapham Junction of the East” since the 1880s.3

With motion pictures at the turn of the century showing scenes of a
modern, Asian port city inhabited by an exotic mix of cultures, Singapore
entered Hollywood’s imaginative vocabulary of exotic locations. The earliest footages would have been newsreels, documentaries and travelogues.
Twenty-four such films from 1900 to 1919 and nine from 1920 to 1928 have
been identified, most notably works by leading international newsreel
production company, Pathé, as well as four 1913 films by Gaston Méliès,
brother of renowned French filmmaker Georges Méliès, which were
screened in American cinemas that year.4

This paper looks at Singapore in the Hollywood imagination and how this
was expressed in non-travelogue feature films from the late 1920s to 1940,
and in particular how “real” the Singapore depicted in these films was.
These productions ranged from ones where Singapore was a vague setting in
the exotic East, with no actual footage of Singapore, to films that attempted
varying degrees of realism through location shoots, local actors and extras,
or depictions of Malayan life. One protagonist emerges from this history
of Hollywood in Singapore – director Clyde Ernest Elliot, who had come
to Singapore repeatedly, releasing first a short travelogue as part of the *Post
Travel Series* in 1918, and then three feature films – *Bring ’Em Back Alive*
(1932), *Devil Tiger* (1934) and *Booloo* (1938) – each time attempting to depict
Malaya more realistically within the expectations and limitations of the
Hollywood studio system.

#### **Fictional Singapore**
While reportage and travel films featuring Singapore were made from the
turn of the century, it was only from 1928 that fiction films set in Singapore
began to be produced. The period from 1928 to 1933 saw several of these:
*Across to Singapore* (1928), *Sal of Singapore* (1928), *The Crimson City* (1928;
Italian title: *La schiava di Singapore)*, *The Letter* (1928), *The Road to Singapore*
(1931), *Rich and Strange* (1931), *Out of Singapore* (1932), *Malay Nights* (also
titled as: *Shadows of Singapore*, 1932), *Singapore Sue* (1932) and *West of
Singapore* (1933).5 None of these films were shot near the tropics and only one, Alfred Hitchcock’s *Rich and Strange*, included authentic scenes of
Singapore – albeit only from stock footage.6

Several of these were adaptations from other mediums. Across to Singapore
was based on the 1919 novel *All the Brothers Were Valiant* by Ben Ames
Williams, while works by Australian author Dale Collins inspired two film
adaptations – *Sal of Singapore* (based on the novel *The Sentimentalists*) and
*Rich and Strange* (based on a book of the same name).7 *The Road to Singapore*
was adapted from a 1929 British stage play, *Heatwave*, by Mills & Boon
writer Denise Robins and playwright Roland Pertwee, while *The Letter*
had a more respectable literary pedigree as the dramatisation of a Somerset
Maugham short story of the same title.8

Of these works, those by Dale Collins and Somerset Maugham were
based on personal observations by the authors. Both made numerous trips
around the world to gather ideas for their writings and both passed through
Singapore in the early 1920s.9 Each chose settings and storylines that echoed
their own experiences. *The Sentimentalists* was set on a long sea journey
that paralleled Collins’ journey round the world in a yacht owned by
American millionaire A.Y. Gowen, reporting on their travels for *The Herald* (of Melbourne, Australia).10 Rather than focus on the liminal experience in
between ports of call, Maugham spent months at a time in specific regions
so as to understand those societies in greater depth.11 *The Letter* was based
on the sensational real-life murder of William Steward, a mine manager, by
Mrs Ethel Proudlock, a Eurasian woman married to an English headmaster
of the prestigious Victoria Institution in Kuala Lumpur.12

In contrast, *Across to Singapore* and *The Road to Singapore* were based on a
fictional setting, whereby Singapore was used in symbolic terms to evoke
certain characteristics of an exotic seaport. *All the Brothers Were Valiant*,
the novel that *Across to Singapore* was based on, was originally set in the
Gilbert Islands in the Pacific Ocean. Like *The Road to Singapore*, the story
was primarily set on a ship in the Pacific, with Singapore appearing only
briefly as a port of call.13 Nevertheless, these romanticised renderings
presented an image of Singapore generally similar to that unveiled by
films based on first-hand research. All the off-location films shot between
1928 and 1933 fell into one of two categories: the seafaring tale (*Across to
Singapore*, *Sal of Singapore*, *Out of Singapore and Singapore Sue*), or the
sultry and often illicit love affair set in colonial society (*The Letter*, *Rich
and Strange*, *Malay Nights* and *West of Singapore*).

*The Road to Singapore* combined both these elements. Singapore acted as
a literary shorthand for a port in the exotic tropics, where passions ran
as hot as the climate. These stories were an extension of a long-standing
trope. Scientific thinking in the 19th century blamed the tropical climate
for all manner of physical and behavioural ills, giving rise to the literary
stereotype of flirtatious girls and adulterous wives in the British Raj.
Gossip newspapers such as *The Civil and Military Gazette* and the stories
of Rudyard Kipling popularised the dramatic potential of such tales,
which were reproduced in a new setting and medium within these early
movies set in Singapore.14

#### **Jungle Documentaries**
The first on-location foreign film made in Singapore emerged from a
very different source of inspiration and was neither set at sea nor about
a passionate romance. Building on the established practice of newsreel
filming, *Bring ’Em Back Alive* was a documentary feature based on the
adventures of Frank Howard Buck, a Texan wildlife collector who had
established his base in Singapore since World War I. The book of the same
title by Buck, already known as a major animal supplier to zoos in America,
became a bestseller in the US when it was released in 1930.15 Backed by
Van Beuren Studios, produced by Buck and director Clyde Elliot, and
distributed by RKO Pictures, the strong reception of the book paved the
way for its cinematic success. Box office takings hit a million dollars within
eight months of its release and the film was one of RKO ’s most profitable
releases in 1932.16 Following its release, Buck travelled to London and the
US , giving speeches to coincide with screenings.17

Ostensibly a documentary, *Bring ’Em Back Alive* was heavily criticised by
audiences in the know, with American naturalist Harry McGuire caustically
calling Buck’s film a “hocus pocus” work of “nature faking” and *The Straits
Times*’ correspondent going “hot under the collar” at the string of inaccuracies
in the film.18 Buck bore the brunt of the bad press but pointed the finger of
blame at Elliott instead. Elliott had readily admitted in public that scenes
of a tiger being shot dead and a python fighting a crocodile had been staged
for the camera.19 Buck said, “To my mind he has been very silly and rather
ridiculous. All pictures are made to entertain people and if a fellow stands up
and deliberately spoils the illusion he is biting the hand that feeds him…. I
don’t mean we want to fool people – as a matter of fact the picture was made
under more natural circumstances than any other of its kind.”20

Such controversies were nothing new in the context of the times. Java expert
Huber S. Banner commented, “The trouble is, though, that after seeing
one of these jungle films that are all the rage nowadays – Frank Buck’s epic
of the Malayan forests, *Bring ’Em Back Alive’*, for instance – nobody will
believe that one doesn’t go about in constant peril.”21 *Bring ’Em Back Alive'*
was quite likely one of the more realistic films of the genre, as Buck asserted,
going by the detailed description in “How Frank Buck Filmed His Tiger-
Python Battle”, an article from the American periodical *Modern Mechanix*
and Inventions. When interviewed, Buck and the main cameraman, Nick
Cavaliere, explained how they capitalised on normal patterns of animal
behaviour around a watering hole by steering a tiger into a forced encounter
with a python.22

Yet there were many different levels of artifice involved in making *Bring ’Em
Back Alive*; the realism of animal behaviour was only one aspect. The other
was the locations where these scenes were shot. Viewers were led to believe that they were watching action from the heart of the Malayan jungle when,
in fact, the close-up scenes were shot at Jurong Road just a few miles away
from downtown Singapore.23 By providing a tropical location for filming,
Singapore was an essential component in creating the illusion of realism
that caught the attention of international audiences. Buck’s emphasis on
a successful “illusion” and that “all pictures are made to entertain” made
it clear that this form of filmmaking was of a different spirit from the
newsreels and documentary films of an earlier era, which news agencies had
continued to shoot.

The criticisms of *Bring ’Em Back Alive* did not hold the Texan adventurer
back from international fame and Buck churned out a constant succession
of books and films in a similar vein: *Wild Cargo* (book, 1932; film, 1934),
*Fang and Claw* (book and film, 1935), *On Jungle Trails* (book, 1936), *Jungle
Menace* (a 15-part film serial, 1937), *Animals Are Like That* (book, 1939),
*Jungle Cavalcade* (film compilation of footage from his first three films,
1941), *All in a Lifetime* (autobiography, 1941), *Jacaré* (film, 1942), *Tiger Fangs*
(film, 1943) and *Jungle Animals* (book, 1945).24

Buck’s success was due partly to his larger-than-life persona but also to
the prolific stream of works that kept him in the spotlight. A strategic
interfacing of his stories in different forms exposed his works to different
audiences and reinforced their impact. For example, in 1930, the book *Bring
’Em Back Alive* became an international bestseller – appealing to audiences
in both Buck’s own America, as well as to the British public, who were
intrigued by the Malayan aspect of the empire. Two years later, the stories from *Bring ’Em Back Alive* were brought to life via moving pictures and the
following year, in 1933, Buck set up a wild animal camp at the Century of
Progress World’s Fair in Chicago, which was visited by two million visitors
in the two years of its existence. In 1939, Buck brought the same camp
exhibit, with thousands of wild animals, to the New York World’s Fair.25

In this respect, Buck’s work made a far greater impact than that of his
contemporary, Ernest B. Schoedsack, a director of travelogues on Persia and
Siam who had travelled to Sumatra to make the orang-utan film, *Rango*
(1931). Despite the fact that Elliot had noted that *Rango* was more authentic
than *Bring ’Em Back Alive*, and that it was regarded by cinema historian
Derek Bouse as possibly the “first fully-realised wildlife film, in the modern
sense”, it failed to achieve box office success.26 *Bring ’Em Back Alive* brought
fame not only to Buck, but also thrust Malaya into the consciousness of
international audiences, with many cinemas even displaying maps. “At last,
many people realised that Singapore is not in South Africa or China, or
anywhere but where it is,” declared Elliott.27
