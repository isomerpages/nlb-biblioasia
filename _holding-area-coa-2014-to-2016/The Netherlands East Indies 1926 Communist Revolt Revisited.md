*[…] In the Dutch East Indies, the demeanour of the native<br>

#### **Introduction**

On 7 October 1926, *The Singapore Free Press* (SFP), a popular Englishlanguage
newspaper in the Straits Settlements, reprinted a long opinion piece
from London’s *The Times*. Entitled “Dutch Policy in Java: Propaganda and
the Native”, the article discussed the ongoing “communist disturbances” in
the nearby Netherlands East Indies (NEI ). A keen observer, the anonymous
author reviewed in great detail the history of the Archipelago and analysed
various immigrant groups in colonial society at that time. He pointed out
that people in the NEI were open to foreign influences, which provided
radical movements – such as Chinese anti-imperialism and Arabian
Islamicism – with fertile grounds on which to grow.

As the Dutch gradually lost their prestige in the natives’ eyes by “perpetrating
acts of injustice and, often, uncontrolled violence”, extremist ideologies such
as communism gained significant support from the indigenous population.3
The author indicated that communist propagandists had successfully worked
their way into schools, trade unions, government departments and military
units. With the growing impudence of the local press and the increase in
disruptive activities, it was evident that extremism had experienced a rapid
upsurge in recent years. The article ended by exhorting the Dutch to take
sterner measures to curb this dangerous communist agitation.4

Printed alongside advertisements on the newspaper’s page six, the opinion
piece probably did not receive the attention it deserved despite its persuasive
analysis and alarmist warnings. A month later, a major communist revolt
broke out in Batavia, followed by similar uprisings in Bantam and West
Sumatra. How could the writer have made such an accurate prediction a
month in advance while the Dutch colonial administration seemed caught
unprepared when the uprising happened? Why did the SFP print the article,
or rather, why did political issues in the NEI even matter to newspaper
readers in British Malaya?

Through NewspaperSG , a digital newspaper database developed and
managed by the National Library Board (NL B) of Singapore, this paper aims to add more nuanced views to the understanding of the 1926/27
communist insurrections in the NEI , especially their broader impact on
Malaya. This paper argues that partly because of the extensive public
discussions surrounding the NEI insurrections, as well as important lessons
learned from their Dutch counterparts, the British administration’s anticommunist
measures predated the formal establishment of the Malayan
Communist Party (MCP) in 1930. As a result of the British authorities’
effective surveillance and policing work, the MCP struggled for its survival
from its inception and never had a real chance to pose serious threats to the
colonial regime before World War II (WWII ).

A few scholars have studied the history of early communist movements
in the NEI and British Malaya.5 Ruth McVey’s *The Rise of Indonesian
Communism* (1965) is by far the most comprehensive account of the origins
of the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI ) until its disintegration in 1927.
Using both Dutch and Indonesian materials, McVey has produced a very
detailed analysis of the 1926/27 revolts and the government’s systematic
suppression of them. The year 1927 is a convenient ending point in McVey’s
narrative because the PKI was forced underground and would not play a
significant role in Indonesian politics until many years later. Yong Ching
Fatt’s *The Origins of Malayan Communism* (1997) investigates the movement
on the British side of the Malacca Straits. Using both English and Chinese
sources, Yong traces the Chinese roots of the early communist organisations
in Malaya. Both McVey and Yong briefly mention the communist
movements of the “other side” in their respective works.

Cheah Boon Kheng (1992) took an important step forward by conducting
preliminary research into the links between the two movements. Besides
an essay-length summary of these connections, Cheah also reproduced a
number of documents that illustrate the MCP’s Indonesian connections
in the early years of the organisation’s establishment (1930), which could
serve as important signposts for further exploration. Despite his interesting
findings regarding the communists’ networks across the British and Dutch
colonies, Cheah’s work does not grapple with the wider socio-political
impacts of these early movements beyond the limited connections of
individuals, which left a gap for further studies.

Many historians consider the PKI uprisings as important precursors of
Indonesia’s nationalist movement, which ultimately led to the country’s
independence.6 When it comes to the actual course of events, however,
existing narratives tend to describe the abortive revolts as ill-prepared, poorly
organised and easily suppressed – and consequently, of limited impact in
shaking the foundation of the Dutch colonial regime.7 It is also commonly
understood that in the aftermath of the rebellions, Dutch authorities dealt
a crushing blow to the PKI and its associated organisations by carrying out
large-scale arrests, imprisonments, executions and banishments. Beyond
these facts, however, very little attention has been paid to the deeper
meanings that the revolt revealed. As the following sections will demonstrate,
the movement created enormous anxiety in the NEI , which forced the Dutch
colonial government to act with a strong hand. Moreover, with frequent
exchanges of information and personnel across the Malacca Straits, the NEI
uprisings also generated considerable uneasiness in British Malaya.


#### **More Than a Source: NewspaperSG as a Method**

Due to communist organisations’ illegal status in both the NEI and British
Malaya, and the fact that many documents did not survive WWII and
the post-independence era that followed, historians have lacked a large
source base to understand early communist movements in the region.8 For
this reason, newspapers can serve as valuable sources and make up for the
shortage of original party documents. Moreover, they also add more nuanced
views to the one-sided narratives that were solely based on official documents
of the colonial archives. Paradoxically, newspapers’ massive information can
also impede the efficiency of historical research as researchers often spend a
lot of time sifting through information to find something significant.

First launched in March 2009, the digital newspaper archive NewspaperSG
presents new possibilities in approaching historical issues in Singapore and the surrounding areas. With its Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
feature, scholars can now perform keyword searches to locate desired
content in 43 newspapers published in Singapore between 1831 and 2006.9
For this paper, newspapers used include the SFP, *The Straits Times* (ST),
*Malaya Tribune* (MT ) and *Malayan Saturday Post* (MSP ).10 The Singapore
press received their information from various sources such as Reuters, its
Dutch counterpart *Aneta* and local NEI newspapers in multiple languages.
ST and SFP also hired their own correspondents, who regularly wrote
reports for the papers’ special NEI columns entitled “The Week in Java”,
“Java Notes” and “Java Press Cables”.11

In addition to the ease of access to the vast amount of information, digital
archives have a lot more to offer than traditional newspapers in many other
regards. For instance, NewspaperSG allows researchers to keep track of events’
developments in a way more similar to how original readers would have
received those messages: breaking news was sometimes based on rumours and
invalidated reports from other sources; reliable details were often not revealed
until much later. With frequent repetitions, corrections, validations, negations,
and more often than not, contradictions in a series of news reports, a reader’s
perception of an event could be very different from its reality. Similarly, how
readers digest news can be influenced by what they read in conjunction with
the news itself. In other words, as far as readers’ impressions were concerned,
the textual context in which the news was reported probably played no less
significant a role than the larger socio-political context in which the event
actually took place. While such nuances are very difficult to scrutinise by
flipping through traditional newspapers, researchers are able to make better
sense of complex issues by tracing the progression of time and capturing
historical moments in the virtual pages of digital archives.

Furthermore, digital newspaper archives open the door for scholars to
conduct quantitative textual analysis in addition to the content-focused “close reading”.12 The latest version of NewspaperSG has a simple yet
powerful analytic tool called the Search Term Visualiser, through which
researchers are able to grasp the changing trends of word use in Singapore
media during the selected period. The following section includes a few
graphs generated from NewspaperSG and illustrates how the Singapore
press responded to communist movements in the mid-1920s in general and
the 1926 NEI communist revolt in particular.

Despite the numerous advantages of using digital newspaper archives,
one should be aware of its shortcomings. For example, the current OCR
technology is far from perfect. Closely associated with the present state of the
original newspapers (or microfilms), the outcome of digitisation may vary
considerably. Even the most advanced digital scanner cannot guarantee the
quality of the digitised materials. The latest version of NewspaperSG has fairly
good coverage of English sources with a relatively high level of OCR accuracy.
Searches in other languages, however, still require further optimisation
due to greater technical challenges to performing OCR for non-romanised
characters. As a result, one should be conscious of the risk of basing their
analysis primarily on a handful of English-language newspapers published
in an extremely heterogeneous colonial society. ST , for example, enjoyed the
reputation of being Malaya’s leading newspaper. Popular only among the
English-educated elites, however, it had a readership of only around 6,000 to
7,000 towards the end of the 1920s.13 This is a low number when compared to
Singapore’s total population – around 400,000 – at the time.14 For this reason,
this research should be supplemented with other materials.


#### **Making Sense of the Numbers**

people commonly associate the origins of communist activity in British
malaya with the ethnic Chinese community and political infl uences from
mainland China. such an association is likely derived from the fact that
the membership of the mCp was predominantly ethnic Chinese. although
the mCp was not formally established until 1930, yong Ching Fatt suggests
that Chinese communists had been operating in British malaya as early as
1921.15 due to contradictions in diff erent sources, the exact founding dates
of malaya’s early communist organisations are diffi cult to pinpoint. it is
generally agreed that the Communist party of China (CpC) established an
overseas branch in British malaya around 1925 to 1926. Th e CpC branch
gradually transformed into the nanyang (or south seas) Communist party
(ssCp) in 1927 with the goal of expanding to all parts of the nanyang
area.16 Following this timeline, one would expect an upsurge in the coverage
of local communist activities in singapore’s print media from 1925 onwards.
Th e search results from newspapersg, on the contrary, show a rather
complex situation:

Th results of keyword search terms “‘communist(s)’ or ‘communism’”
(Fig. 1) indicate that there was indeed a steady growth (of the use of the
terms) that started from 1920. Th e sudden increase in 1925 is also consistent
with the alleged establishment of the early communist organisations in
malaya. however, when consulted, the relevant newspaper articles were
mostly concerned with communist movements outside of British malaya.
Th roughout the 1920s, the ssCp was only mentioned twice in 1928 and once
in 1929. similarly, there were no results for organisations such as the CpC’s
nanyang provisional Committee, south seas Branch Committee, south
seas general labour union, and only one result for the Communist youth
league.18 although it is possible that errors could have distorted the results
due to translation or other technical issues, the diff erence is negligible.
Th e results indicate that early communist organisations had a very limited
impact in the public sphere of British malaya prior to the 1930s.

What contributed to the surge of communism-related discussions in
singapore newspapers in 1925? since communist activities in the nei were
frequently mentioned in the mid-1920s, probably because of the pki revolt,
the keyword search terms “‘communist(s)’ and ‘Java’” are used (Fig. 2).19

From Fig. 2 it is evident that discussions about nei communist activities
surged in 1925 and peaked in 1926. articles that contained both te rms
“communist(s)” and “Java” grew by 545.5 percent, from 14 in 1924 to 71 in
1925. is it possible that the media in singapore coincidentally increased the
coverage of Java and communism as two separate events? in other words,
was the singapore press actually concerned about communist activities in
Java from 1925 to 1927? we can rule out this possibility by using the term
“Java” alone (Fig. 3).

Fig. 3 shows that the term “Java” saw an overall 14.5 percent growth from
6,819 in 1924 to 7,808 in 1925 – a steady increase for sure, but certainly not as
pronounced as the terms “‘communist(s)’ and ‘Ja va’”. understandably, while
the volume of Java-related articles remained constant in the next two years,
news reports on communism in Java reached its peak in 1926 and remained
high in 1927 due to the pki insurrections. Th e media’s growing general
interests aside, it is clear that the communist movement in the nei had
already attracted signifi cant attention a year prior to the outbreak of the revolt.

to better understand the impact of the 1926/27 revolt in British malaya,
we can compare the search results of the terms “‘communist(s)’ and
‘Java’” and “‘communist(s)’ and ‘China’” (Fig. 4). Th is chart shows that
overall, communist activities in China (broadly defi ned) exerted a far
greater infl uence in British malaya than their indonesian counterparts
over the years, with the only exception being 1926, presumably due to the pki revolt. starting from 1927, however, while China’s infl uence
fl uctuated (at a relatively high level) over the years, the impact of the nei
communist movement became signifi cantly weaker.

Technically speaking, this is a highly problematic comparison, which is
due to the inherent shortcomings of digital newspaper archives mentioned
earlier. when performing a search with multiple words (Figs. 2 and 4), a lot
of “noise”, such as inappropriate text encoding or extraction, may interfere
with the desired outcome. For example, some of the search results in Fig. 4
could refer to “China” in one report and “communist(s)” in a diff erent
report, but the two reports are somehow interpreted as being in the same
newspaper article. it is possible that although both reports are unrelated,
such an article might still pop up in a keyword search.

Hence, while newspapersg’s search term visualiser is a useful tool in
illustrating general trends of word use, it is insuffi cient to tell a full story.
But by performing a basic keyword search, we can draw the preliminary
conclusion that the mention of nei communist activities in the singapore
press rapidly increased in 1925 and peaked in 1926, which could be associated
with the pki uprisings. Th e intensive media coverage on nei communism
preceded the rise of the largely Chinese-infl uenced local communist
organisations in British malaya. to better understand the impact of the PKI revolt on Malaya, it is worthwhile to delve deeper into the actual content of
the newspaper articles.

#### **The 1926 PKI Revolt Through the Eyes of the Singapore Media**
***Precursor***<br> 
The situation in the NEI in the first half of 1925 was generally peaceful
except for sporadic clashes between the police and alleged communist
agitators. The NEI colonial authorities managed to arrest a number of
communist leaders for their roles in organising strikes, holding meetings
and delivering “seditious speeches”. The police’s crackdown on communist
activities was effective in major hotbed cities such as Bandung, Surabaya
and Padang.23

From the second half of 1925, there were frequent news reports in the
Singapore press concerning Chinese disturbances in Medan, bomb threats
across Java, labour disputes in Surabaya and various forms of the Islamic
movement.24 These incidents hardly caused the government any serious
consequences. There was also no solid evidence suggesting that the PKI
was behind all these disturbances. The extremists often operated without
coherent party leadership, but their activities were so ubiquitous and
unpredictable that fear inevitably arose among government officials and
the public. For example, at the end of October 1925, the Singapore press
reported several seemingly unrelated acts of unrest that took place in
various locations across Java and Sumatra. Some of these events appeared
to be labour disputes and some were intertwined with politically sensitive
groups such as Chinese coolies, Arabian intellectuals and rebel Acehnese.
Without concrete proof, the authorities and media both conveniently
attributed the widespread disturbances to communist agitation:

   *The strike agitation in Surabaya continues… there are rumours<br> 
   of impending difficulties with the harbour coolies, although the<br> 
   Surabaya press declares that the [coolies have] declined to answer<br> 
   the call of communist leaders.*25<br><br>  
   *The Arabian journalist Alfothak, editor of the Arabian paper<br> 
   Alwivak, which has communist tendencies, is to be deported.*26<br><br>  
   *The strike among the workers of the Tegal Proa Co. was a result<br> 
   of the discharge of six of their number [sic] who had communist<br> 
   tendencies*.27

Consequently, the colonial authorities adopted stringent anti-communist
measures. On top of carrying out numerous crackdowns, the government
promised to imprison or banish communist leaders.28 Not only did the
authorities forbid the PKI and its associated trade unions from holding
meetings, but they also kept a tight rein on the local press.29 The police
captured several editors of non-European newspapers for their alleged
communist tendencies and for publishing anti-government articles. Besides
the Arabian journalist Al-fothak mentioned earlier, other arrests included
Lauw Giok Lam, an editor of the Malay-Chinese daily *Keng Po* in Batavia,
and Gondojoewono, an editor of a native paper named *Njala*.30 The authorities
also seized the Bandung-based Chinese newspaper *Sin Bin* for reprinting an
article that had previously appeared in communist publication *Soerapati*.31
