#### **Episode summary** ####
In the 1950s, Abbess Yang Yincai of Hai Inn See, a temple in Choa Chu Kang, discovered that bamboo plants grew particularly well in the temple grounds and led the effort to make \_soon kueh\_ regularly. The \_kueh\_ became so popular that it was sold at the nearby coffeeshop, at 5 cents apiece, where it quickly became an essential breakfast item for residents.
