#### **Hsu’s Nanyang Studies: Under the Shadow of Siamese Historiography**
Before co-founding Chinese-language Southeast Asian (Nanyang or South
Seas) studies in Singapore in 1940, the Suzhou-born historian Hsu Yun-
Tsiao (1905–81) sojourned as a teacher at Zhong Hua School (1933–36) in
the Malay-Muslim region of Patani in southern Thailand.1

Known mostly for his academic and editorial work in South Seas Journal
(*Nanyang xuebao*, 1940–), the popular *South Seas Miscellany* (*Nanyang zazhi,*
1946–48) and the children’s magazine *Malayan Youth* (*Malaiya shaonian*,
1946–48), Hsu also led his students from Nanyang University (or Nantah)
on ethnographic trips; promoted translations from Burmese, Thai and
Vietnamese; annotated a play about Zheng He; wrote classical Chinese
poems; compiled volumes on the anti-Japanese war effort by Nanyang
Chinese (1938–45) and the war crimes trial (1946); as well as produced
Southern Chinese language glossaries and Malay-Chinese dictionaries.
Working across media to promote Malayan identities in the postwar era, Hsu gave 15-minute-long radio lectures on local histories, later compiled
into *Collected Writings on Malaya* (*Malaiya congtan*, 1961).

In contrast, Hsu’s early, pre-Singapore years have been not as well known
in Nanyang historiography. Recently digitised by the National Library,
Singapore (NLB) in May 2018, Hsu’s five unpublished diaries (1930–38)
provide rare glimpses into his interwar Nanyang studies in Siam (now
Thailand), which anticipate the geopolitics and scholarly politics of Nanyang
studies in Singapore some 20 years later.2

In 1933, in his most detailed 400-page diary, Hsu noted his anticipation
in receiving publications from Shanghai: “Jinan University’s Bureau of
Nanyang and American Cultural Affairs (*Nanyang Meizhou wenhua shiye
bu*) sent over a huge bundle of the *Nanyang Newsletter* (*Nanyang qingbao*).3
According to the subscription form it costs one baht, payable to Kaiming
Press. I ordered 30 numbers, from vol. 1 number 1 through vol. 2 number
10”. [*Diaries* v.2: 131]. Other interwar Chinese publications on Southeast
Asia, such as *Nanyang Research* (*Nanyang yanjiu*, 1928– ), were managed by
this bureau through key figures such as Liu Shimu, Li Changfu and Yao
Nan, who would later co-found the South Seas Society (1940– ) with Hsu
in Singapore.4 Anxious yet excited by Japan’s state-sponsored study of the
Nanyang (or Nanyo) in the 1920s, these Chinese intellectuals founded the
Jinan Cultural Bureau in 1927.5 By producing original work and translating
Japanese and Western writings on Southeast Asia, the Jinan scholars hoped
to redirect intellectual-political energies from Japan, and foster closer ties to
local Chinese newspapers and journals in Penang, Singapore, Malacca and
Batavia (now Jakarta).

Entering the scene slightly later and based in the Nanyang itself, Hsu
transformed the Western- and Japanese-influenced research of Jinan scholars
by drawing on a variety of Thai, Malay and Burmese sources.6 Hsu arrived
in Patani just after the 1932 Siamese Revolution by the People’s Party
of Siam, which had partially overthrown the monarchy to introduce a
constitution. Hsu witnessed the chaotic waves of royalist counter-revolution
against Bangkok that culminated in the Bowaradej rebellion of October
1933. In 1932, the future Prime Minister Phibul Songkhram forced Chinese
assimilation by reviving the Primary School Act of 1921 and the Private
School Act of 1918, requiring Chinese schools, which were then private
schools, to register with the government, effectively placing them under
state control. The Thai language was also made the compulsory medium of
instruction. Hsu joined and negotiated for the Chinese schools’ education
movement (1933–36), which protested against these changes. By 1930, elite
members from Teochew, Hokkien, Cantonese, Hakka and Hainanese
language groups in Siam had agreed to teach in Mandarin and consolidate
a Chinese national identity.7 Lamenting his students’ lack of proficiency,
Hsu had at times taught Chinese using English and *zhuyin zimu* (Mandarin
phonetic alphabet) [v.2: 234]. But now, Chinese language class time had
been severely curtailed and other courses had to be taught in Thai. Hsu had
to learn Thai and pass a language examination within one-and-a-half years of
arriving in Siam [v.2: 172–73].8

Purveying the Chinese Nationalist Party’s (Kuomintang) curricula of
overseas Chinese education based on the civilisational mission of *Zhonghua
huiguan* (c. 1900), the “umbrella” organisation for Chinese affairs, Hsu lobbied for Chinese autonomy and cultural upkeep against the new
regime’s forced assimilation policies, which reversed prior arrangements
whereby Chinese subjects had been protected by the Siamese monarch.9
In 1936, Hsu left Zhong Hua School and taught English at Bangkok’s
National School of Science and Engineering.10 In 1938, Hsu left for
Singapore after the fascist Phibun, now a Field Marshal, forced Chinese
newspapers and schools – those not already closed by the government or
voluntarily – to shut down nationwide.11

In this section of the essay, I examine the oft-overlooked influence of
modern Siamese historiography on Hsu’s Nanyang studies. In Hsu’s
estimation, the three most important scholars of Nanyang histories were
the French Sinologist Paul Pelliot (1878–1945), Sino-Indian historian
Feng Chengjun (1887–1946) and Prince Damrong Rajanubhab of Siam
(1862–1943).12 The latter, though exiled to Penang after the Siamese People’s
Party coup in 1932, had famously inaugurated the study of modern Thai
history (*prawattisat*) by giving a “nationalist reading of the *phongsawadan*”
(dynastic chronicles).13 “By 1930, Damrong had retired and was leading the
effort to build the collection at Siam’s National Library by accumulating
ephemeral texts”.14 As the “Father of Siam History” [v. 2: 275] and “the royal librarian-in-chief” who played a “crucial role in the establishment of the
Thai territorial state during the late 19th and early 20th centuries”, Damrong
gets Hsu’s stamp of approval:

   *Dafa told me: Thai people call the Head of the Royal Library<br>
   the “Father of Siam History” [บิดาของประวัติศาสตร์สยาม bida<br>
   khong prawatisat siam]; he who happens to be the only historian<br>
   in Thailand.<br>
   大发告余，谓暹人称皇家图书馆主任为暹史之父บิดาของประวัติศาสตร์<br>
   สยาม 蓋暹国惟一之历史学家也*。
