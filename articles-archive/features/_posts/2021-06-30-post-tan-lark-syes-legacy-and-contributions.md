#### **Lee Meiyu** looks back at the life of rubber tycoon Tan Lark Sye, long-time chairman of Hokkien Huay Kuan and the founder of the former Nanyang University in Singapore.

In October 2019, a ceremony was held at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) to mark the renaming of a road. Originally called Nanyang Valley, the small road leading to the Chinese Heritage Centre was renamed Tan Lark Sye Walk at an event attended by then Minister for Education Ong Ye Kung.[^1]

The new road name commemorates the efforts of a man who was the driving force behind the setting up of Nanyang University, a predecessor institution of NTU. Nantah, as it was known, was set up as a result of the rubber tycoon’s vision, determination and personal interest. He mooted the idea for the university in the early 1950s, pledged to personally donate $5 million to it, and was the first chairman of the university’s executive committee, a role he held for almost a decade.

The setting up of Nantah was a major point of pride for the Chinese community in Malaya. Thanks to Tan’s tireless efforts on behalf of the university, his name became indelibly linked with the institution. Unfortunately, Tan’s advocacy on behalf of Nantah was one of the reasons that led him into conflict with the government, culminating in his Singapore citizenship being revoked in 1964 following an inquiry into his political activities.

Although Tan ceased to be a citizen, he chose to continue living here. He focused on his businesses until his death from a heart attack about a decade later. Nantah soldiered on until 1980, when it merged with the University of Singapore to form the National University of Singapore. The next year, Nanyang Technological Institute (NTI) was set up on the premises of Nantah, and in 1991, it was renamed NTU.[^2]

##### Building a Business Empire
Although Tan was one of the key figures behind the founding of Nantah, he himself did not have much formal education. Tan was born in 1897 in the town of Jimei, part of Tong’an county, in China’s Fujian province. The sixth of seven brothers, Tan was orphaned as a child. He spent a few years at Jimei School, which had been set up by Tan Kah Kee, a prominent businessman and community leader in Singapore, who had also hailed from the same town.

In 1916, the 19-year-old Tan left China for Southeast Asia and found employment at one of the companies founded by Tan Kah Kee. The capable young man later worked in the latter’s Khiam Aik rubber factory in Singapore[^3], and after amassing enough capital and experience, decided to strike out on his own. In 1923, at the age of 26, Tan started Lian Hoe Rubber Shop with one of his older brothers, which was incorporated as Aik Hoe Rubber Company in the following year.[^4]

Thanks to Tan’s business acumen, Aik Hoe became one of the leading players in the rubber trade and by 1938, the company had business interests throughout Southeast Asia as well as agencies in New York and London. In October 1938, Aik Hoe was reorganised as a private limited company with a registered and paid-up capital of $1 million.[^5]

Apart from rubber, Tan was also involved in the finance, paper and cement industries. He set up Asia Insurance Company and Overseas Union Bank together with Lien Ying Chow, and served as a director of Oversea-Chinese Bank and chairman of Chiyu Banking Corporation Ltd in Hong Kong. Two of his companies, Lima Paper Products Co. Ltd and Tasek Cement Co. Ltd., were listed on the stock exchanges of Singapore and Malaysia.[^6]

##### Citizenship for Foreign-born Chinese
Having spent the first two decades of his life in China, Tan’s initial political allegiance was to the land of his birth.[^7]  However, after the People’s Republic of China (PRC) was formed in 1949, ties between the British colonial government and the PRC were severed and Tan, by then in his early 50s, decided to focus his attention on Singapore where most of his businesses were located.[^8]

In 1950, Tan became the chairman of the powerful Hokkien Huay Kuan, which represented the largest dialect group in Singapore. He had been appointed to this position by the previous chairman, Tan Kah Kee, who was 23 years his senior. In the latter’s opinion, the younger Tan had the requisite determination to lead the clan association.

The Hokkien Huay Kuan under Tan Lark Sye contributed much to social welfare and education in Singapore. During the two decades of his leadership, the association supported the maintenance and expansion of five Chinese-medium schools: Tao Nan School, Ai Tong School, Chong Hock Girls’ School, Nan Chiau School and Kong Hwa School.[^9]

Apart from heading the Hokkien Huay Kuan, Tan was also involved with the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce. He was its chairman from 1950 to 1952 and, in this capacity, pushed for the chamber to be involved in politics. His main concern was to seek the enfranchisement of the Chinese community in Singapore as the majority of foreign-born Chinese residents were not eligible to vote in local elections. “The chamber ought to be concerned with politics and the Chinese people ought to fight for voting rights for the legislature and the City Council,” he argued in 1951. “They should organise themselves and help the less well-informed to register for citizenship and try to get those who care for the well-being of the Chinese elected as legislators.”[^10]

The Chinese Chamber of Commerce thus led the fight in pushing for citizenship to be granted to foreign-born Chinese who had been residing in Singapore for many years. The citizenship issue was finally resolved in 1957 when the Citizenship Ordinance came into force, which granted citizenship to more than 200,000 foreign-born Chinese residents.[^11]

Later, as a committee member of the chamber, Tan also advocated for the use of vernacular languages (Chinese, Malay and Tamil) in the Legislative Assembly and City Council so that non-English-speaking candidates could be elected. In 1955, the chamber submitted a resolution to the colonial government calling for the abolition of the English-only rule and also rallied various local communities to sign a petition that subsequently garnered support from about 140,000 residents. As a result of these efforts, the language restriction was lifted in 1959 when the first fully elected Legislative Assembly was formed.[^12]
