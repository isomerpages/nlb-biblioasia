#### _Ma. Theresa R. Milallos_, a Lee Kong Chian Research Fellow, explores how gender relations in Aceh have changed and continue to be transformed by the dynamism of Islam’s interpretation in Aceh.

#### **Introduction**

The discourse on gender in Aceh has always been a site of tension. This paper seeks to understand how gender relations have changed and continue to be transformed by the dynamism of Islam’s interpretation in Aceh. Considerable research1 has already shown that women in Southeast Asia, including those in Aceh, enjoyed a higher level of economic autonomy and personal freedom prior to the colonisation period compared to those from West, East and South Asia. After the December 2004 tsunami however the discourse included how women may have been responsible for the disaster2, and consequently how they should be controlled. How is it possible to rationalise these seemingly incongruent facts? In what ways and to what extent can this ‘high status’ of women be observed in Aceh historically and at present?

#### **Transition to Islam in Aceh in the Early Modern Period**

While the exact period of Islam’s entry into Aceh is highly contested3, recent discoveries of tombstones in Kuta Lubhok, Aceh Besar district give evidence of a Muslim community as early as the 12th century (McKinnon, 2006, pp. 30–32). The initial stage in this expansion and adoption process had been marked by intense interaction between Islam and local belief systems, culminating in the *wujuddiyah* doctrine of Hamzah and Shamsuddin made popular during the reign of the great Iskandar Muda. Here, Islam provided a powerful rationale for state-building under the authority of a mortal, but Godendowed, sultan. When Iskandar Muda4 died however what followed was a tumultuous era of Islamic renewal and reformism. Aceh as a sultanate under the reign of Iskandar Thani was by then already a consolidated empire that had nothing more to prove. The entry and popularity of a more legalistic and scriptural brand of Islam promoted by Nur al-Din ar-Raniri5 exhibited a more ‘modern’ and innovative sultanate, one that was increasingly intolerant of local influences, and more importantly had the end-view of pacifying the numerous and increasingly powerful foreign Muslim traders in Aceh (Reid, personal communication, 5/09/2008). The culmination of this stage was a ‘fierce heresy-hunt’ led by ar-Raniri against the *wujuddiyah* doctrine (Ito 1979).

By the 17th century, Aceh’s power was waning. The sultanate was shrinking fast following the loss of many of its territories and the weakening of trade in its ports. Traditional power had shifted away from the sultan into the hands of *orang kayas*, who subsequently put four queens on the throne from 1641 to 1699 (Reid, 2005, p. 94–111).6

By 1675, with the death of Safiyyat al-Din, the first of Aceh’s queens, the sultanate was confined only to north Sumatra (Djajadiningrat, 1979, p. 62). A more tolerant Islam, advocated by Abd al-Rauf alSinkili who had supplanted the increasingly unpopular ar-Raniri who had begun to lose favour with the court, characterised the long reign of the four queens. This period was marked by a return to ‘syncretism and inclusiveness’, however with *adat* gaining more ground in the countryside (Reid, personal communication, 5/09/2008).7

These ‘waves’ of Islamic adoption, reformism, and renewal had profound consequences to gender relations in pre-19th century Aceh. They raise some pertinent questions: to what extent had Islam become entrenched in the Acehnese sultanate during the early modern period, and to what degree was Islamic law actually observed? Which segments of the population fell squarely within the ambit of Islamic piety and practice during this time? Answers to these questions will hopefully clarify what it means for women during this period to enjoy ‘high status.’

#### **Patterns in the Adoption of Islam and Their Consequences to Gender Relations**

Following the patterns of intensification and weakening of Islamic influence in Aceh, it is not surprising to encounter observations like those made by Francois Martin, who wrote in 1602 of women who could walk about openly with breasts exposed, or had ears adorned, heads uncovered, and who were even able to bathe naked in the river without fear of being accosted. Adultery received a high penalty — execution or the cutting off of body parts. By 1621, Augustin de Beaulieu noted that caning, a ubiquitous Islamic practice, was also a popular way to administer punishment (Reid (Ed.), 1995, pp. 57–60 & 66–67). Yet, Martin also recorded that sexual promiscuity appeared to have been acceptable in the early 17th century (Reid (Ed.) 1995, p. 58). This was corroborated in the 19th century by Hurgronje, who, even while stressing the social importance of a bride’s virginity before marriage, also noted that there existed “comparative freedom of intercourse between the sexes in Aceh” (1906, pp. 328–346).

The early to mid-17th century was characterised by behaviours that may not have been acceptable to a more legalistic and scriptural interpretation of Islam. There prevailed a relatively permissive environment where ‘hermaphrodites’ abounded and prostitution was tolerated. The king of Aceh could keep more than 300 concubines, and women could literally venture into the masculine ‘outside’ world of commerce and trade. This kind of behaviour was not condoned among the elite classes, however, as notions of morality in their circles would certainly have been much higher.

Regarding the issue of female concealment, contemporary debate has been rife as to whether it is a traditional, and therefore ‘indigenous’, practice8. In many areas in Southeast Asia since the 16th century, the evolution of sovereign states and the economic gains from trade had produced increasingly stratified social structures. In 1602, for instance, the *orang kayas* in Aceh began to sport long fingernails on the thumb and little finger, a sign that they did not need to do work by hand (Lombard, 1991, p. 58). Their women, in turn, were also freed from labour, removed from the ”sexually dangerous and aggressively masculine ’outside’”, and thus concealed from the public gaze (Andaya, 2000, p. 241).

In Aceh, female concealment appears to have acquired a mystical quality during the era of the four queens (c. 641–1699). While Aceh is not unique in having placed four queens on the throne9, it appears to be the only sultanate that had strict requirements for a queen to be “a maiden, advanced in years, and connected by royal blood with the ancient royal line” (see Marsden, 1986, p. 453–454). Unlike Hindu Java in the early 16th century, which Pires observed had numerous unmarried women (1944, p. 177), Aceh certainly did not have a comparable traditional regard for maidens who did not marry (Hurgronje, 1906, pp. 295, 343).

As in many Muslim societies, the notion of ‘outside’ (*keluar*) versus ‘inside’ (*dalam*) to delineate masculine and feminine spheres of activity appears to have been influenced to a large degree by the principles of Islam. Andaya (2000, pp. 231–253) has argued that the higher the social class of a woman and her family, the higher the societal constraints placed on her to withdraw from the ‘outside’. As monarchs, however, the queens straddled both the ‘outside’ world of politics traditionally occupied by men, and the ‘inside’ world of mysticism and the home allotted to the female. While women could never be *caliphs* (the Prophet’s deputy as the Messenger of God) because they belonged to the wrong sex (Mernissi, 1994), conditions of emergency may warrant their political ascendancy. In such circumstances, seclusion acts to balance the already dangerous situation of crisis, which precipitated female ascendancy in the first place. Indeed, this ‘asexualisation’, or the process by which one is rendered virtually sexless, is heightened by the insistence on a queen being an ‘old maid,’ the life stage when a woman is often regarded as least desirable. Having passed the childbearing stage, she is also considered to be wiser and “gender neutral” (Andaya, 2000, p. 236). At the same time, because royal power is held as highly masculine, these queens maintained large harems, like their male counterparts (Andaya, 2000, p. 244). For a male monarch, the possession of a large harem was obviously a symbol of prestige and potency10. A sexless and undesirable female monarch, therefore, assumes mystical power through the display of a large retinue of women under her protection.

These notions about female power however were never static; they signalled the foregoing ideologies of the time. The deposition of sultana Kamalat Syah at the end of the 17th century due to a *fatwa* from the Chief Qadi of Mecca, for example, is very much reflective of the waves of Islamic reformism and renewal and the religious turmoil sweeping across Aceh.
