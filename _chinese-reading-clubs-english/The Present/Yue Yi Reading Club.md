**About**:	We often find that reading alone can be difficult to sustain over time, but reading together as a group—sharing and exchanging ideas—helps maintain enthusiasm and supports long-term commitment to reading. We hope to promote reading culture and encourage more people who love books to join our reading community. Our book selection covers a wide range of topics. Starting with just 3 people in our first session 3 years ago, we have grown into a reading community of nearly a thousand members, and we will continue to champion reading.
