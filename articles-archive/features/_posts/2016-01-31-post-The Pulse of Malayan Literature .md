<div style="background-color: white;"><i>Pulse</i> is notable for being the first published collection of English verse by a local poet and is said to have heralded the start of a Singaporean/Malayan style of poetry. <i>Image

In the early 1950s, two young Malayan undergraduates, Wang Gungwu and Beda Lim, bonded over their shared love for English poetry. They spent hours poring over the 
classic literary works of Shakespeare, W. H. Auden and T. S. Eliot, and in the process were inspired to create their own unique brand of literature.1

Just 19 years old at the time, Wang was inspired to create literary works that were distinctly Malayan in character. Pulse,the first known collection of English poems by a Malayan, was the culmination of his early literary efforts. Lim helped Wang publish his maiden poetry collection,2and the year of its publication, 1950, has been hailed by prominent Singaporean writers like Edwin Thumboo as the defining moment Singaporean/Malayan poetry took root.3

Reflecting its origins as an amateur 
varsity production, Pulse – a modest 
16-page booklet – is stapled together 
with a cover that is adorned with a handdrawn illustration of the first poem, “To 
Tigerland”. The cover design depicts a 
floral wreath lying on the ground beside 
sheaves of lallang and is framed by clouds, 
birds and a rainbow. It contains 12 poems 
on various topics written in a variety of 
styles and forms, ranging from free verse 
to rhymed metrical stanzas.4
