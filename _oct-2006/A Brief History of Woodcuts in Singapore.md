#### In 1966, six local woodcut artists held their first group show at the National Library on Stamford Road. In 2006, works by the same artists take centre stage in an anniversary exhibition at the National Library Building on Victoria Street. This introduces the art of woodcut printmaking, and its history and practice as an art form in Singapore.

#### **Pre War Years**
The practice of woodcut (also known as woodblock prints), as an artistic medium, by our local artists could date back to the 1930s. As early as then, Chinese immigrant artists had held posts as teachers for the local Chinese schools and editors of the main Chinese daily newspapers like *Nanyang Siang Pao* (NYSP) and *Sin Chew Jit Poh*. Followed by the setting up of the Society of Chinese Artists in 1936 and the establishing of the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA) in 1938, the art form was actively and systematically promoted. The main vehicle for the promotion of woodcut was the Chinese newspapers.

NYSP started it frst art supplement, *Wenman Jie*, from May to December 1936 and later *Jinri Yishu* from January to August 1937. During that period, readers of NYSP were exposed not only to woodcut images but also to articles related to the art form. The development of this medium mirrored China's Modern Woodcut Movement, with Lu Xun being its chief promoter from 1929 till his death in 1936. The works of the German expressionist artist Kathe Kolwitz and the Belgian artist Frans Masereel, which were avidly introduced by Lu Xun, were often reproduced here. On top of that, a series of articles aimed at introducing the new art form in a systematic way was also published. The articles involved the discussion of the appropriateness and the objectiveness in the portrayal of scenes and events, the basic understanding of the purpose of the medium in highlighting the plight of the people in the lower strata of society and, of course, on the techniques and materials involved.

By mid-1937, woodcuts moved beyond newspapers and into exhibition halls. Numerous exhibitions were held to promote the art and later as fund-raising events for the war efforts back in China. Woodcuts became an acceptable artistic medium, exhibited alongside the more established mediums such as ink painting, photographic works and cartoons. In the new academic year starting July 1940, a woodcut lecturer was even included in the teaching staff list of NAFA (NYSP, 31 July 1940). This clearly signified the importance of the art form during that era and how through the concerted efforts of many, provided the hotbed for a quick resurgence of the practice of the woodcut medium in the post war years.
