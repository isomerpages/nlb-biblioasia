The founding of Singapore has typically been attributed to the strategic genius of Stamford Raffles. Frequently overlooked is the part played by his superior in the East India Company, the Marquess of Hastings. This book provides an account of Singapore’s founding by drawing on the personal correspondence between these two men. Published here for the first time, these private letters reveal the challenges that Raffles and Hastings faced when manouvering within the Dutch-dominated East Indies. Just as significantly, the letters also reveal the complex relationship between the two men. Historian John Bastin brings rigorous scholarship to bear in this book, while at the same time presents it in a clear, readable style that will engage both specialist and general readers.

*Hands: Gift of a Generation* is a book born from the multi-sensory exhibition of the same name by the Singapore Memory Project (SMP), held between August and October 2013 at the National Library Building, Singapore. By elegantly depicting first-hand accounts from Singaporeans of all walks of life, this book seeks to document their lives and present the stories of Singapore as told by Singaporeans in a personal and evocative way. Comprising 45 individual profiles, mostly verbatim accounts and each accompanied by a striking photograph, this book is a valuable collection of stories that reflects the transformation of Singapore through the years. The memories are rich in their diversity, describing struggles, sacrifice, triumphs and joy.
