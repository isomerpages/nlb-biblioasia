What do burial grounds, secret societies and old photographs have in common? For Lim Yee Hung, co-founder of [Hidden Singapore](https://hidden.sg/) (HiddenSG), they are all fragments of Singapore’s history waiting to be pieced together.

Incorporating materials from the [National Archives of Singapore](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/), HiddenSG is an escape game based in the real world that uses WhatsApp messages and artificial intelligence (AI) to guide players to the hidden gems in Singapore's many neighbourhoods.

Led by Void Deck Cat, the game’s in-house mascot and AI chatbot, players receive clues that bring them on quests around Singapore. As they explore different locations, players can text their answers to the cat or ask for hints if they are lost.

HiddenSG has attracted over 75,000 players since its launch in mid-2022, garnering rave reviews about its interactive and historical elements. The game has since expanded internationally, with Hidden Aotearoa launching in New Zealand in December 2024 in a partnership with one of the country’s largest Māori tribes.[^1] There are plans to bring similar experiences to Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States.

#### **Unearthing the Past Through the National Archives**

Lim returned to Singapore in 2022 after a 14-year stay in the UK. “When I came back, I was trying to reconnect with my roots in Singapore,” Lim recalled. In a bid to get reacquainted with Singapore’s history and heritage, he stumbled upon the National Archives which proved to be a treasure trove.

Fuelled by curiosity about local lore surrounding Holland Village, Lim turned to the archives for evidence. “I knew Holland Village used to be a graveyard so I wanted to find the photos before it became the Holland V \[we know\] today,” he shared. From research, he uncovered historical photographs[^2] and oral history recordings[^3] verifying that the area used to be a Hakka cemetery.

To Lim, different archival mediums highlight different facets of history, each providing pieces of a larger puzzle. “The oral histories give you a lot more nuance”, while photographs reveal places in their former glory. Weaving together both mediums in his game provides players with a glimpse into Singapore’s past. “Because you are standing there, you’re seeing the photo and you’re listening to the \[audio track\], then your imagination kicks in,” he said.

Research often leads to unexpected discoveries. He did not know that Redhill Lim used to be a notorious haven for gangs and secret societies until he chanced upon an oral history interview.[^4] “My god… all the Sa-lak-kau[^5] \[a secret society\] and everything was there, like police don’t even go there.”
