 #### Librarians _Michelle Heng_, _Ng Hui Ling_ and _Mazelan Anuar_ bring us up to speed on what’s new on NewspaperSG, a digital archive of Singapore and Malaya newspapers dating back to 1831.
 
 If you dread spending hours sitting in a dimly-lit room watching a stream of microfilmed newspapers flutter by on a projector screen, you might well become a fan of NewspaperSG (newspapers.nl.sg).
 
A collaboration by the National Library Board (NLB) and Singapore Press Holdings (SPH), the service facilitates more productive research. Where in the past, library patrons had to plough through reams of microfilmed newspapers, now a simple keyword search allows browsing of the digital archive of Singapore and Malaya newspapers published from 1831 to 2006. At present, 23 newspaper titles are available.

Research shows that users are now more likely than ever to turn to search engines when looking for information. To address this issue, newspaper content has been search engine-optimised with the permission of the respective publishers, and been received with enthusiasm by netizens.

Since its official launch in January 2010, NewspaperSG has proved to be tremendously popular — more than 8 million digital pages have been accessed by a total of 1.2 million visitors. Patrons can search 14.8 million articles in these digitised newspapers, from both NLB libraries and also in the comfort of their own homes.

With the addition of Malay-language daily *Berita Harian* and Chinese language newspaper *Lianhe Zaobao* to NewspaperSG’s stable of archived news publications, users who had voiced hopes that plans to include digitised copies of newspapers in other languages were in the pipeline, now see their wish come true. Another proposed development is to incorporate newspaper content from other NLB-subscribed databases with NewspaperSG to form a single seamless service.

One of the significant time-savers that NewspaperSG offers is a citation-saving feature. Conveniently located at the top of the webpage, it allows users to save and email citations for future reference. For a truly rich Web 2.0 experience, NewspaperSG is integrated with social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter, to encourage knowledge sharing.

The recent addition of vernacular language newspapers, user-friendly features such as multilingual user interfaces, translated search terms and search keyword recommendations further enhance users’ experience of this comprehensive digital archive.

*Berita Harian* is the only Malay newspaper published in Singapore today. First published in 1957 in Kuala Lumpur and distributed in Malaya as a rival newspaper to the *Utusan Melayu*, the edition known to Singaporeans today came into being in 1965. This new Berita Harian’s focus was news reports and discussions of issues specific to Singapore. An online version, *cyBerita*, was made available in 1996. Today, the paper is published by the Singapore Press Holdings (SPH), independent of Malaysia’s *Berita Harian*.

*Berita Harian* provides a platform for the Malay community in Singapore to voice their views and has been “a source of Malay leadership” — a number of its former journalists and editors such as Mohamad Maidin Packer, Hawazi Daipi and Zainul Abideen Rasheed have moved on to political careers.

#### **Berita Harian**

*Berita Harian* merupakan satu-satunya akhbar yang diterbitkan dalam bahasa Melayu di Singapura pada masa ini. Mula diterbitkan pada tahun 1957 di Kuala Lumpur, ia diedarkan ke seluruh Malaya sebagai pesaing kepada akhbar *Utusan Melayu*. Selepas 1965, edisi Singapura mula diterbitkan untuk melaporkan dan membincangkan isu-isu berkenaan Singapura. Versi dalam talian, *Cyberita*, diterbitkan sejak 1996. Kini *Berita Harian* yang diterbitkan di Singapura sudah tiada kaitan dengan Berita Harian yang diterbitkan di Malaysia selepas Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) ditubuhkan dan mengambil alih usaha penerbitannya.

*Berita Harian* yang bertindak sebagai wadah untuk masyarakat Melayu menyuarakan pandangan mereka telah menjadi sumber melahirkan pemimpin Melayu. Antara wartawan dan penyunting Berita Harian yang kemudiannya berkecimpung dalam arena politik termasuk Encik Mohamad Maidin Packer, Hawazi Daipi dan Zainul Abideen Rasheed.

With 200,000 copies published daily by Singapore Press Holdings (SPH), *Lianhe Zaobao* is the leading Chinese newspaper in Singapore. The paper is also distributed in mainland China, Hong Kong and Brunei. The result of a merger between *Nanyang Siang Pau* and *Sin Chew Jit Poh*, the paper originated as the *Nanyang Sin-Chew* *Lianhe Zaobao* (or *Lianhe Zaobao*, for short). The former two newspapers were the earliest published in Singapore, in 1923 and 1929 respectively.

In its lifetime, *Lianhe Zaobao* has set a number of firsts. In 1991, it became the first Chinese newspaper in the world to implement fully computerised output typesetting and an industry wide sensation in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Study groups of delegates visited the Singapore offices of *Lianhe Zaobao* to study this new production method from journalist input to layout. In 1993, *Lianhe Zaobao* became the first foreign newspaper to be available in mainland China, on the newsstands of five-star hotels in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and in other major cities. In 1995, *Lianhe Zaobao* launched the world’s first Chinese e-newspaper, zaobao.com, which allowed for the online proliferation of its content. It the beginning, zaobao. com received about 10,000 hits daily. This number has since increased by more than a hundred times to 5 million today. Entering the era of web2.0, SPH launched its bilingual online platform *omy*. Targeting young people between the ages of 18 and 35, this platform introduced the use of vodcasts and podcasts as new ways of presenting news. As part of the SPH stable, *Lianhe Zaobao* continues to provide strong content backing for *omy*’s news and entertainment information.
