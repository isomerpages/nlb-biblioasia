#### **Introduction**
Amid the booming newspaper industry and active Chinese literary scene
in Singapore after the Second World War, two editors of newspaper literary
supplements stood out for their contributions: Xing Ying (杏影; 1911–67)
and Yao Zi (姚紫; 1920–82). The supplements under their editorship were
influential and informed local literary trends in the 1950s and 1960s.
Newspaper supplements played a significant role in promoting literature
and literary aesthetics and developing local literary talent, because they
were published more frequently than literary magazines and had a wider
audience.1 They typically appeared as a half-page section near the end of the
newspaper. For budding writers, these supplements served as a springboard
to the more prestigious literary magazines.2 The arts led to a paucity of reading materials4 and the dampening of the
literary scene.

At the same time, this sociopolitical environment gave rise to a cultural
phenomenon known as “yellow culture” (黄色文化). Yellow culture refers
to activities and behaviour perceived as degenerate, such as dance clubs,
gambling and pornography.5 In October 1953, in what was seen as a tragic
consequence of yellow culture, a 16-year-old girl was raped and killed
at Pearl’s Hill. A public outcry ensued. Cultural institutions, student
organisations and schools organised anti-yellow culture campaigns, and
students from Chinese schools such as Chung Cheng High School and
The Chinese High School initiated the slogan, “Resist yellow culture”
(抵制黄色文化). The anti-yellow culture movement (反黄运动) received
widespread public support.

The movement was another turning point in the development of
Chinese literature and newspapers in Singapore. New compositions such
as songs, dramas, novels and poems emerged, many of which stressed the
importance of a healthy mind,6 in opposition to the corrupting influence of
yellow culture. The number of literary works increased by 25 percent, from
113 before the anti-yellow culture campaign, to 142 in 1955.7 In the same
year, there were 414 Chinese newspapers and publications, more than twice
compared to 163 in the prewar period from 1837 to 1941.8

The vibrant Chinese literary and newspaper scene in the 1950s can be
attributed to three reasons. First, the British colonial government relaxed its editorship of *Wen Feng*, the literary supplement of *Nanyang Siang Pau*, in 1954. Not only was he successful in his journalism career, Xing Ying was a
good prose writer and wrote books such as *While You Are Young* (趁年轻的
时候, 1958), *Books and People* (书与人, 1960) and *Century of the Fools* (愚人的
世纪, 1960), etc. He also contributed regularly to the literary supplements,
*Lü Zhou* and *Shi Ji Lu*, both edited by Yao Zi. Xing Ying passed away in
1967 from illness at Singapore General Hospital at the age of 55.

Yao Zi, whose birth name was Zheng Meng Zhou (郑梦周), was born in
Fujian province, China. As a student, he edited a small newspaper, *Jiang Tao*
(江涛). He subsequently became an editor at *Jiang Sheng Daily* (江声日报)
in China, before coming to Singapore in 1947, where he taught at Tao Nan
School and Jin Jiang School. In 1949, his debut novel, *Miss Hideko* (秀子姑
娘), sold 16,000 copies in a single month; his subsequent novels in the 1950s
and 1960s, such as *The Lure of Coffee* (咖啡的诱惑) and *Storm* (风波), were
also popular. Yao Zi wrote under at least six different pen names in *Shi Ji
Lu*. He was an editor at *Nanfang Evening Post* (南方晚报) from 1952 to 1953,
*Nanyang Siang Pau* from 1953 to 1954, and *Shin Min Daily News* (新明日报)
from 1969 to 1977. Yao Zi passed away in 1982, at age 62.

#### **International Literature and Communication between Editors and Readers: *Lü Zhou* and *Wen Feng***
*Lü Zhou* and *Wen Feng*, edited by Yao Zi and Xing Ying respectively, are
considered the two early literary supplements of the 1950s. The two men had
different editorial philosophies. Yao Zi’s focus on literary aesthetics likely
stemmed from his literary values as a novelist, and under his editorship, *Lü Zhou* published both international and local literature. Xing Ying focused
on developing young writers, and with *Wen Feng*, he created a vibrant
supplement that allowed greater interaction between readers and the editor.
In *Lü Zhou* and *Wen Feng*, Yao Zi and Xing Ying honed their respective
editorial styles, which became amplified in their later supplements.

***Lü Zhou: Bringing Literary Aesthetics into the Nanyang Literary Scene***
Yao Zi was the editor of the literary supplement *Lü Zhou* in *Nanfang
Evening Post* from 15 November 1952 to 3 January 1953, editing a total of 33
issues. *Lü Zhou* published news on regional literature and introduced local
writers, including Xing Ying and Wei Bei Hua (威北华), both of whom later
became renowned writers and editors. *Lü Zhou* was Yao Zi’s first edited
local literary supplement. In his first editorial in 1952, he wrote with palpable *Lü Zhou* usually relied on a few good writers for regular contributions. One of these regulars was Wang Ge (王葛),15 a talented Malayan known
for his novels and essays. *Lü Zhou* published his novels16 such as *Mimosa*
(含羞草), *Sail* (帆) and *Fog* (雾), his
poem titled “Shell” (贝壳), and even
his translation of the English naturalist
Gilbert White’s 1789 essay on swallows.17
Several of the young regular contributors
later became important writers. For
instance, Zhao Xin (赵心), better known
as Zhao Rong (赵戎), contributed many
pieces of literary reviews and criticism,
and Xing Ying’s essays and novels written
under the pen name Li Qi appeared in
almost every issue of *Lü Zhou*.18

Yao Zi broadened the horizons of
local readers by introducing regional
and international literature in *Lü Zhou*.
A column was dedicated to poetry from
Indonesia (Figure 2); featured works
included “Vigil” (守夜), “A Lie” (欺瞒),
“Last Night” (昨夜) and “Palace” (王宫).19
The poems were chosen and translated
by Yue Zi Geng (越子耕), better known
by his other pen names, Wei Bei Hua the 1950s, this column exposed readers to developments in the worldwide
literary scene. Articles covered a wide range of events and topics, such as
“Belgium Issues Stamps Commemorating Writers” (比国发行作家纪念邮票),
“Venice Establishes Literary Award among Nine Countries” (威尼斯创立
九国文学奖), “Children’s Literature in Argentina” (阿根廷的儿童文学) and
“Puppets in Italy” (木偶人在意大利).26 The column also featured articles
on international writers and literary reviews, including “The Experience
of a Reporter cum Writer: François Mauriac” (新闻记者兼作家的莫里亚
克略经历), written by Di Jun,27 and a review, “Turgenev and His Works”
(屠格涅夫及其作品), by the Irish writer Robert Lynd and translated by
Yuan Si (原思). That the review was published in full over three issues of *Lü Zhou* was telling of the significance Yao Zi placed on the Russian writer.
“The works of Turgenev,” he wrote, “are among the greatest in modern
world literature.”28

***Wen Feng: Xing Ying and His Communication Tool with Readers***
Xing Ying was the editor of *Wen Feng* in *Nanyang Siang Pau* from 18
January 1954 to 15 August 1958, during which 828 issues of the supplement
were published. In the first two years, *Wen Feng* was published daily;
after 1956, its publication became less regular, partly because of its narrow
thematic scope – almost half of the works revolved around the lives of
rubber plantation workers, employer-employee relationships, and the
difficulties of finding employment.29

Unlike Yao Zi, who focused on publishing highly aesthetic literary
works, Xing Ying used *Wen Feng* to encourage literature-loving youths
to write freely,30 in line with his belief that journalism was a meaningful been less vibrant, and there would not have been so many youths interested in literature.”36

Xing Ying created an editorial column – Random Notes (补白杂记),
later renamed *Wen Feng* Mailbox (文风信箱) – to express his views and
communicate with the supplement’s readers, who responded well to it.37
One reader, Mian Ti (缅堤), wrote that this column was “a great inspiration”
and his favourite thing to read in *Wen Feng*.38 Xing Ying also used this
column to encourage young writers: “Please write about the issues in life, on contributors becoming well-known writers and editors, for instance Xing
Ying, Zhao Rong, Wei Bei Hua, Xie Ke, Lian Shi Sheng (连士升), Miao Xiu
(苗秀), Wei Yun (韦晕) and Liu Bei An (柳北岸), among others.

The first issue of *Shi Ji Lu* was published four days after the rape
and murder of Zhuang Yu Zhen, the case that sparked the anti-yellow
culture movement (Figure 4). Yao Zi was accused of being a yellow writer
(黄色作家), for his novels such as *Miss Hideko* (秀子姑娘, 1949) and *Ural
Mountains* (乌拉山之夜, 1950) contained descriptions of female body parts
and sex scenes. Some of his poems published in *Shi Ji Lu* hint at the
criticisms he faced. In “A Note to Myself at Age Thirty: A Reply to My
Friends” (三十自题:兼答关怀我的朋友们), he wrote: “Worldly ups and downs
are within my destiny, how can others judge my glory or downfall?”44

During this period, Yao Zi was supported by a group of writer friends.
This further cemented his practice of relying on a small group of trusted
writers for the supplement. *Shi Ji Lu*’s three regular contributors were Xing
Ying, Zhao Rong and Miao Xiu, whose articles formed the supplement’s regular group of contributors supplied *Shi Ji Lu* with articles of literary
merit, it resulted in less diversity of writing styles.

As a consequence of the anti-yellow culture movement, the atmosphere
in the literary scene became more conservative. Yet, Yao Zi remained a
creative and experimental editor. Under his editorship, *Shi Ji Lu* ushered
in a new wave of Western literature to the postwar Nanyang literary scene.
Compared to *Lü Zhou*, *Shi Ji Lu* featured more international content. The
inaugural issue included two American short stories in translation – “The
Cop and the Anthem” (警察和赞美诗) by O. Henry and translated by Jiang
Nan Liu (江南柳), and “The Tax Collector” (给收税员) by J. P. McEvoy and
translated by Zhu Ai (主艾) – and an essay on the American writer Jack
London. Other works of Western literature subsequently published in *Shi Ji Lu* included “L’Aventure” (The Adventure, 艳遇) by the Norwegian writer
Knut Hamsun, translated by Ya Ji (亞玑);50 “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow”
(睡谷的传说) by the American writer Washington Irving, translated by
Jiang Nan Liu (江南柳);51 “A String of Blue Beads” (一串蓝珠) by the
American writer Charles Fulton Oursler, translated by Xi Bang (希邦);52
and the poem “Out of the Night That Covers Me” (夜幕笼罩着我) by the
British poet William Ernest Henley, translated by Shou Ming (受明).53 *Shi
Ji Lu* occasionally also published translations of biographies of well-known
writers, such as “The Life of O. Henry” (奥·亨利的生平), translated by Jia
Sheng (加生).54

Yao Zi also published works by Hong Kong writers such as Lü Lun55
and Liu Yichang (刘以鬯). Liu contributed the short story “Enchanting."
