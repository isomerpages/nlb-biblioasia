**About**:	The reading club is dedicated to fostering reading culture amongst incarcerated individuals, recognising literature as a powerful tool for personal transformation and intellectual development. Through carefully structured reading programmes, participants develop critical thinking skills, cultivate self-reflection, and build confidence in their ability to engage with complex ideas and perspectives.
The initiative seeks to expand participants' knowledge base whilst encouraging them to challenge preconceived notions and develop more nuanced understandings of society.
