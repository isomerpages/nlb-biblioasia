In the 1890s, a group of Peranakan (Straits-born Chinese) intellectuals decided to publish a magazine for the Straits community in Malaya.

 With China in the throes of political 
change, the Straits Chinese in Malaya were 
politically and financially on the rise. The 
magazine’s editors, Lim Boon Keng and Song 
Ong Siang, were educated professionals and 
respected community leaders.1

in British Malaya, but also address the concerns of all who were Straits-born, including 
Malays, Eurasians and Indians.

for 11 years. As the first English magazine
