#### **Due to development and urbanisation, Lim Boon Keng’s last home at Paterson Hill no longer exists today.**
By Patrica Lin

Lim Boon Keng (1869–1957) was undoubtedly one of the most iconic figures in the history of Singapore and a prominent member of the Straits Chinese community. From his youth in the 1880s until the end of World War II, his fame as a scholar, physician, social reformer and legislator had earned him a place in history as the “Grand Old Man of Singapore”, or on other occasions, “Sage of Singapore”.[^1]

Much has been studied and written about Lim’s contributions in the diverse fields he was involved in and mainly served in a leadership position. He was a Chinese member of the Straits Settlements Legislative Council (1895–1903; 1915–21) and a municipal commissioner (1905–1906). He also co-founded the _Straits Chinese Magazine_ (1897), Singapore Chinese Girls’ School (1899), Straits Chinese British Association (1900) and Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce (1906) as well as a number of banks.[^2]

However, the remaining years of Lim’s life between 1946 and his death in 1957 are essentially a blank. Curiously, for an individual with so much in the way of experience in legislative affairs, social organisation and public education, Lim was virtually invisible during Singapore’s birth travails toward independence and nationhood.

What has become known recently from close members of his family, however, is that in his last years, Lim assumed an unexpected role that reflected his key philosophies on humanity and social order. Between 1937 and his death in 1957, Lim lived in an antiquated, 19th-century home and became quite accidentally the head of his own “kampong”.[^3]&nbsp; This kampong, or village, stood right in the midst of the hustle and bustle of the city, an island in itself untouched by Singapore’s emergence into a new era.[^4]

#### **An Attap-roofed Mansion**

Lim’s kampong was located in an area that is today considered as one of the most expensive in the world. The identification of Lim’s old mansion at 1 Paterson Hill and how it evolved into a kampong is one of the hidden chapters of Singapore’s history.

The departments of Chinese Studies and Geography at the National University of Singapore have identified and mapped over 200 kampongs once found all over Singapore.[^5] However, the kampong with nearly a hundred men, women and children that was formerly at 1 Paterson Hill has neither been recognised nor accounted for. With the introduction of public housing in the form of high-rise flats, Lim’s kampong, like other clusters of wooden and attap thatched houses across the island, disappeared from the local landscape. As kampongs made way for concrete buildings, so too went what was known as “kampong spirit”, or _gotong royong_ (”mutual aid”), based on a sense of community and social cohesion.

Central to what eventually morphed into Lim’s village between 1946 and 1975 was a mansion-sized house situated on a triangular lot bordered by Paterson Hill, Paterson Road and Grange Road. The huge, rambling wooden bungalow with an attap roof was a curious two-storied, 7,000 sq ft (about 650 sq m) building standing on a five-acre (20,234 sq m) compound.[^6]

Chong Joo Beng, whose family was Lim’s tenant, was born in an annexed portion of the main house in 1947. According to Chong, there were some smaller houses, mostly wooden and of random design, built within the compound and sited closer to the Paterson Road side. Some of the houses were shack-like with corrugated zinc roofs”.[^7]

Both Chong and Lim’s grandson, Lim Kok Lian, who spent a great deal of his childhood years in the Paterson Hill mansion, recall that there were several long-term Chinese families as well as Punjabi, Malay and Eurasian families living in huts on the compound and in the mansion itself.&nbsp; Members of the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy also rented rooms in the main house from Mrs Lim Boon Keng nee Grace Yin Pek Ha. In residence too were Lim Kok Lian’s father, the legendary auto racer Lim Peng Han, his mother and his two siblings.[^8]

Chong and Lim Kok Lian remember that the sprawling compound had a front garden that “was reasonably maintained”, although “the hedges on the perimeter of the compound facing Paterson Hill were hardly ever trimmed”. Chong also remembers that around the area of the mansion occupied by Lim Peng Han and his family, “disemboweled motor car bodies and engine parts were everywhere to be seen”. The grounds were covered with duck and chicken droppings; the latter being the by-product of the fighting cocks that the ace race car driver bred along with the exotic Siamese fighting fish he kept in rows of earthenware and glass jars.[^9]

(From NewspaperSG). Lim Boon Keng was referred to as “The Sage of Singapore” as far back as the 1920s. In the recollections of Avery Mckenzie, a resident of Gulangyu, an island in Xiamen, when Lim was president of Amoy University (now Xiamen University). It was Lim’s erudition in both Western and Chinese cultures that earned him the sobriquet.

Her brother Chong Joo Seng, in an interview with me in 2019, further described the community’s spirit of “gotong royong” that existed as spirit of mutuality as people game together toward a common good.
