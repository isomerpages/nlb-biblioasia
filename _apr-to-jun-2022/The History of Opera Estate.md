Today, no one buying a home in Opera Estate would bat an eyelid at paying over a million dollars for a place there. This is in stark contrast to the 1950s when developers first began selling homes there. Back then, a one-storey terrace house in Opera Estate would sell for just under $10,000. 

In those days, life in the estate was a bit of a struggle. It was off the beaten track, buses did not ply the area and residents had to deal with constant flooding. However, some six decades later, life is very different.

Opera Estate is a private residential estate bordered by New Upper Changi Road, Bedok South Road, Upper East Coast Road and Siglap Road. The street names in the estate were inspired by European operas and bangsawan (traditional Malay opera). 

The area was part of almost 500 acres of coconut and rubber plantations owned by the Frankel family. Abraham Frankel had arrived in Singapore in 1888 from a poor village in Lithuania to pursue a better life for his family, and eventually became a prominent and wealthy merchant. The Frankels’ sprawling landholdings in Siglap (which was near the sea at the time before land reclamation) included a house in which the family lived until World War II.[^1]

Around 1947, the land was acquired by Crédit Foncier d’Extrême-Orient, a pioneer Franco-Belgian land developer in Singapore, for about $1.1 million. The deal was brokered by Nassim & Co. Limited.[^2] The area was eventually divided into Frankel Estate and Opera Estate.

#### **Private Residential Development**

The development of Opera Estate into a residential area began in the 1950s.[^3] Crédit Foncier d’Extrême-Orient divided up the land and sold the plots to various developers who embarked on different housing projects in the estate. These included Crédit Foncier itself, the Singapore Trading Company and Nassim & Co.
Nassim & Co. in turn sold off a small parcel of land to a developer, Chua Chye Chua, in 1957. Chua recalled: “[T]he environment there… it was a semi-deserted place, jungle-like environment with a lot of rubber trees, ponds for the ducks and… pig [farms]. Then you have small hillocks made of limestone and so on. … [After I purchased the land], I have [sic] to do all this clearance, filling up all the ponds, knocking down the hillocks before I could start building. It took me some time.”[^4] Chua built 12 bungalows with modern sanitation which were sold between $15,000 and $18,000 each. 

According to him, the houses in Opera Estate were not targeted at the wealthy: “They were the usual working-class people who are clerical workers or some semi-professional ones and so on. These are the kind of houses they can only afford to buy. Other houses in the other parts of Singapore would probably cost them well over a hundred thousand [dollars]. A hundred thousand [dollars] in those days were big money.”[^5] 

In addition to bungalows, there were also smaller and cheaper terrace houses. The homes sold by Crédit Foncier were on Dafne and Aida streets and were one-storey terrace houses with asbestos roofs and cement floors. Their prices started at $9,760.[^6] Nassim & Co. sold single-storey terrace houses along Fidelio Street starting from $14,000. Each came with two bedrooms, a utility room, a spacious lounge and dining room, and a front and back garden.[^7] In 1957, Nassim & Co. advertised a “modern two-storey bungalow” with three bedrooms in Opera Estate for $24,900.[^8] 

In a Berita Harian article about Opera Estate in 1989, bangsawan actor Shariff Medan, one of the estate’s early residents, said he bought his single-storey terrace house on Dido Street for only $7,800. He recalled that the area was not popular at the time. “Tetapi ramai orang tak suka tempat ini sebab jalannya berlekuk, berlumpur, tak ada kemudahan dan banyak nyamuk.”[^9] (Translation: But many people did not like this place because the roads were full of potholes and muddy. The area also lacked facilities and was infested with mosquitoes.)
