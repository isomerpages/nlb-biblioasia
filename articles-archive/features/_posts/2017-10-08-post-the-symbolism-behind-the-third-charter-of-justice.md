#### This legal document – issued by the colonial government in 1855 – is an integral part of Singapore’s constitutional history. **Kevin Khoo** explains the significance of its elaborate borders.

The roots of Singapore’s legal system can be traced back to the British colonial era, when English common law was first adopted. English law was first introduced to Malaya through a Royal Charter[^1] of Justice issued in Penang in 1807.

The Second Charter of Justice was issued in 1826 when Singapore, along with Melaka and Penang, became part of the Straits Settlements. The Second Charter extended the jurisdiction of the Court of Penang to Singapore and Melaka, thereby establishing a legal system based on English common law throughout the Straits Settlements.

The Third Charter of Justice of 12 August 1855 reaffirmed the reception of English law, and resulted in the first formally constituted court in Singapore.

As a “letters patent” or public written order issued by the British Crown, the Third Charter of Justice embodied the sovereign authority of the monarchy and was richly adorned with symbolism. We take a look at the design elements decorating the physical charter document, and explore the significance and meaning behind its many symbols.

#### **THE ROYAL COAT OF ARMS OF THE UNITED KINGDOMS, 1855**

This royal coat of arms, which may only be used by the reigning monarch, takes centre stage at the top of the document. At the heart of the royal arms is a shield divided into four quadrants. The first and fourth quadrants each depict the three guardian lions that represent England, Normandy (northern France) and Aquitaine (southwestern France) – territories traditionally associated with the British Crown. The second contains a single lion rearing on its hind legs representing Scotland, while the third has a harp representing Ireland.
Encircling the shield is a garter or belt with the French motto, Honi soit qui mal y pense, which translates as “Shame on whosoever thinks evil of it”. The shield is flanked by a lion crowned with a cross and a chained unicorn, which represent England and Scotland respectively. The lion is associated with Christianity and the virtues of Kingship – dauntless courage, valour, strength, justice and righteous power – while the unicorn symbolises the ideals of purity, grace and power.

A crown, which represents the British monarchy, sits atop the shield with a small lion perched on it. Emblazoned on a banner at the base is a second French motto, *Dieu et Mon Droit*, which means “God and My Right”.[^2]
