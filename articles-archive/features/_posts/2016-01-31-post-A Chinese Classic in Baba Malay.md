Written in the 14th century and set during the last days of China’s Han dynasty and the tumultuous Three Kingdoms period (circa AD 220–280), the *Romance of the Three Kingdoms* is a well-known Chinese classic of epic proportions and a cast of thousands. In the late 1800s, a Baba Malay version of this classic was published in Singapore – making this popular tale more accessible to the Peranakan (Straits-born Chinese) community.1

Titled as *Chrita Dahulu-kala, Namanya Sam Kok, Atau, Tiga Negri Ber-prang: Siok, Gwi, Sama Gor di Jaman “Han Teow”* (henceforth referred to as *Sam Kok*), the series consists of 30 volumes translated from Chinese to Baba Malay. The translation was done by Chan Kim Boon, an administrator at law firm Aitken & Rodyk,2 with the help of two other people, Chia Ann Siang and Tan Kheam Hock.3

Published between 1892 and 1896 by Kim Sek Chye Press, the entire series totalled some 4,622 pages, and a single volume was sold at a $1 each.4 *Sam Kok* is most likely the earliest complete Malaytranslation of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, ahead of Indonesian versions from 
Java published in 1910.5
 The series was 
typical of Baba Malay materials in Malaya 
at the time, where epic stories were serialised into multi-volume publications. This 
facilitated a subscription-based model 
that spurred the growth of the fledgling 
Baba publishing industry in Singapore.6
The majority of the translated Baba 
Malay literary works were heavily illustrated to complement the storyline and 
heighten the visual appeal of the publications. These drawings, rendered in the 
style of traditional Chinese woodcuts, 
usually featured main characters and 
events in the stories.7
Interestingly, Chan encouraged communication between himself and the readers and even among readers themselves 
by publishing letters in English, Chinese 
and Malay containing comments on previous volumes of the book. He also shared 
his trials and tribulations in producing 
the books as well as his financial woes, 
photographs of himself and his assistants 
and other private information.8
