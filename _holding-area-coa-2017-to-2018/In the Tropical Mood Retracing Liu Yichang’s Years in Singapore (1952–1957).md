#### **Introduction**
In 2000, a new generation was introduced to Hong Kong writer Liu
Yichang (刘以鬯, 7 December 1918 – 8 June 2018) through the technicoloursaturated
imagery of Wong Kar Wai’s *In the Mood* for Love and *2046*, two
films inspired by Liu’s seminal novels *Tête-bêche* (《对倒》) and *The Drinker*
(《酒徒》, which was considered the first stream-of-consciousness Chinese
novel) respectively. The films’ protagonist, a cigarette-puffing newspaper
editor and pulp-novelist played by actor Tony Leung, was also loosely based
on Liu himself.

Wong’s films may have been set in Hong Kong in the 1960s, but the prime
of Liu’s life had been a decade earlier in Singapore in the 1950s, where he,
aged 34, experienced the golden era of Singapore’s tabloids, was initiated
into the glitzy *getai* (歌台, live revue) world, fell in love with a beautiful
songstress and married a dancer with a beautiful heart.

The diasporic twinning of Hong Kong and Malaya due to political and
historical events of the time created a wealth of opportunities that prompted
the exchange of commerce, talents and culture. Malaya’s post-war demand
for Chinese talents in the publishing and entertainment industries had made
Liu’s, and his wife’s, brief stint in Malaya possible, thereby shaping his
personal and literary life forever.

In 1952, Liu was headhunted to join the high-profile but short-lived paper
*Ih Shih Pao* (益世报, ISP) in Singapore. He returned to Hong Kong in 1957,
ill and disillusioned, after several false starts at establishing his newspaper
career. From then on, Liu, as a novelist based in Hong Kong, continued
a long and prolific relationship with Singapore’s *Nanyang Siang Pau*,
publishing more than 60 Malayan short stories between 1958 and 1959,
followed by an unbroken serialisation of 55 novels from 1970 to 1985,
out of which three were set in Singapore.

On the occasion of his centenary, my paper retraces Liu’s Malayan years and
attempts to make sense of his life and time here through newspaper archives,
newly unearthed novels and published works, as well as interviews with his
wife and close friends in Singapore.

This paper examines the overlapping influence of the two distinct but
connected worlds that Liu Yichang inhabited in Singapore, specifically the
tabloid industry and *getai* inner circle, which led to the intertwining of the
two personas in his inner world, namely the “newspaper man” (报人, often
featured in his stories and novels) and the “storyteller who entertained the
public” (娱乐大众的小说家). A chronicler of mid-20th-century Singapore
society, Liu created a rich body of Malayan work that, though sadly neglected,
deserves to be preserved and celebrated as part of our cultural heritage.
