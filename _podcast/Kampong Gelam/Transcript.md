<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Hi, everyone. My name is Jimmy, and I’m the Editor-in-Chief of BiblioAsia,
a publication of the National Library of Singapore. Today, Kampong Gelam
is known as a place for hipster cafes, Middle Eastern restaurants and too
many souvenir shops. However, back in the 19th- and early 20th-centuries,
the area was very different. It was a capital of Malay intellectual, political
and religious life in Singapore and as a result became the birthplace for
what has become the classics of Malay cuisine. One writer has called Kampong
Gelam [an] “incubator for the Nusantara kitchen”. That writer is our guest
today. Khir Johari is an educator, food historian and author of an award-winning
book<em> The Food of Singapore Malays: Gastronomic Travels Through the</em>  <em>Archipelago </em>published
in 2021. Since then, the book has won, among other things, the “Best of
the Best Book” at the 28th Gourmand World Cookbook Awards, known as the
Oscars of the cookbook world. Khir was a guest chef on season two of <em><a href="biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg/podcast/kampong-glam-kitchen-malay-world/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">From Book to Cook</a></em>,
the video series produced by the National Library of Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Welcome to BiblioAsia+, Khir. How are you?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>Very well, thank you, Jimmy. Thank you for having me.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>It’s a pleasure. And congratulations, by the way, on winning all these
awards. How does it feel to be famous?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>Well, all I wanted to do right from the start was to document. I didn’t
realise it was going to lead to all of these nice things.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Yeah. You know, your book is beautiful. We’re going to talk about it a
little bit later. But I want to take us back to the video series that you
did. You made something called <em>mee maidin</em>, a noodle dish. Can you
tell us a little bit more about this? What is this dish? What does it look
like?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>The consumption of noodles can be traced back to three different sources:
China, Siam and Persia. So over time they became staple food among the
people, and they are regarded as their own culinary tradition. So, one
such noodle is the yellow <em>mee</em>, the word <em>mee</em> itself is from
the Minnan dialect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pairing of these raw <em>mee</em> with a distinct concoction, say, a
gravy, a broth or a spice mix creates a dish. Such is the case with <em>mee maidin</em>,
the pairing of the yellow noodle, <em>mee</em>, and a unique ragu. I call
it ragu here. I’ll tell you why. Made of krill. So ragu is called ragu
because the sauce is thick. It’s been slow cooked [so] that it’s rich and
flavorful. Well, krill takes centrestage for this ragu. Krill – we call
it locally <em>udang geragau</em>, sometimes it’s <em>udang grago</em>. Or <em>pa-pai</em> or <em>ribbond</em>,
you know, depending on which geography you are located. Now it is served
with lettuce, bean sprouts, hard boiled eggs, tofu, fried shallots, cut
fresh chili and calamansi.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Where does <em>maidin</em> come from?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>This is a very interesting question. This <em>mee</em> was created by someone
by the name of Mamak Hussain. You can tell from the name, Mamak Hussain.
So Mamak Hussain was from India, and he settled in Singapore. You know,
he settled over at number 34 Bussorah Street. So that was his host family,
with some time, it became his adopted family.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, in my study of food history in Singapore, I notice that Indians have
a knack of understanding what the audience likes and what would sell. And
we look at this array of food that’s not from India, but it has been adopted
and adapted, <em>chendol</em> to <em>mee siam</em>, to <em>rojak</em> to <em>popiah</em>.
So, the Indians have actually assimilated and made it their own.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, here comes Mamak Hussain who understands what’s available locally.
And he came up with this particular ragu that became very popular. But
before he passed on, he passed a recipe to this adopted family, a couple
by the name of Nor Din with his wife, Salmah. So, it was originally called
or at least called among the people of Bussorah Street as <em>mee mahdeen</em> because
he popularised it. So, then <em>Mah</em>, because Mah is his wife, Salmah,
and then Deen is his name, but to call it <em>mahdeen</em> requires more
effort, as opposed to <em>maidin</em>. So over time, it morphs from <em>mahdeen</em> to <em>maidin</em>.
But if you look at Haja Asfiah’s book, <em><a href="https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/redir/itemdetails?bid=4080178" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Hidangan Warisan Kita</a></em>,
a monumental cookbook, she recorded it as <em>mee</em>  <em>mahdin.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>That’s so interesting. Did he sell it? How did people encounter it if
you weren’t a friend of his?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>So, he went around on his food cart to sell [the noodles] when he was
taken over by Wak Din. They called him Wak Din. And then with time, you
know, like all good things, you know, ideas proliferate, people try to
copy, to reverse engineer. So, yeah, it got really very popular within
Kampong Gelam and beyond.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Okay, that’s very interesting. But I have to say, I’ve never eaten <em>mee maidin</em>,
and I don’t think I’ve ever seen <em>mee maidin </em>being sold around Singapore.
So, it is a dish that’s still available?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>Well, I’m afraid, commercially, it’s extinct. But, of course, you can
still find it, you know, homes still prepare this. In part, it’s got to
do with the cost of making <em><a href="https://biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg/podcast/belacan/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">geragau</a></em>.
In the past, Clive Street market, which was the equivalent of [today’s]
Jurong fish port, was just a stone’s throw away from Kampong Gelam. It’s
part of the larger Kampong Gelam. So, it was very easy. It was inexpensive.
If you happened to have relatives in areas like Siglap, when <em>geragau </em>was
in season you could just scoop it out of the water. But these days this
gets very expensive.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Ah I see. So, you need fresh <em>geragau</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>You definitely need fresh <em>geragau</em>. And at the same time, you know,
it’s something that requires a bit of work.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>I wish I had, you know, been there when you were making it. Someday I
hope I will be invited. I’m inviting myself to your home to eat <em>mee maidin </em>someday.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>I would be very honoured.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Okay, so this dish is a Kampong Gelam original. And you’ve called in your
book, you’ve called Kampong Gelam an incubator for the Nusantara kitchen.
What does that mean? And how did that happen?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>Well, I think we have to understand what Kampong Gelam was. Kampong Gelam
was, and still is, an urban cosmopolitan space where people from various
backgrounds can mingle and learn and appreciate so much about each other’s
culture. And the other thing about Kampong Gelam, too, is to understand
that when we say Kampong Gelam we are looking at this larger umbrella,
this largest district. Within Kampong Gelam, there are many sub-kampongs.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>I did not know that.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>For instance, there’s Kampong Intan within Kampong Gelam, as the name
implies, that’s where the Bancharis would do the diamond polishing then,
cutting and polishing. We have Kampong Tembaga that’s the Coppersmiths
kampong – that’s lower Bussorah Street. Upper Bussorah Street is Kampong
Haji, lower Bussorah Street is Kampong Tembaga.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, for instance, Arab Street, which is the other high street that we
have – we have High Street by the Parliament House and then we have the
more mainstream High Street, this Arab Street. Arab Street has this vernacular
name called Kampong Jawa. Kampong Jawa is one of the sub-kampong within
Kampong Gelam.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>So Kampong Gelam, was that nexus, maybe.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>Yeah, so because it’s urban, it’s cosmopolitan, there’s some level of
affluence. People, well, you know, a new place calls for a new recipe,
people were experimenting. With affluence you have access to ingredients,
exposure to what other cultures were making, so we see quite a bit of a
hybridization in food and localisation as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A total of four main arteries of food production in Kampong Gelam. First,
we have Bussorah Street, also known as Kampong Haji. Margaret Sullivan,
in her book called <em>Can Survive Lah</em>, she was looking at trades that
were at risk of disappearing. So, she looked at various people making,
say, the wooden clogs, people dealing with basket weaving. And she was
looking at <em>kueh</em> making. When it came to <em>kueh</em>, food production,
she identified Bussorah street as the epicenter of that production, in
part because it was the place that people congregated every year during
Ramadan to buy food, to break their fast and was prepared by the locals.
And yet everybody had their own specialty within Kampong Gelam that they
shared their creation with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Arab Street is this emporium, you know, of textiles, of carpets, of spices
and flowers. Then there’s Kandahar Street. But today you don’t see Kandahar
Street as what it used to be. Imagine the whole line of street – when you
stepped on the street, you could hear people speak in Malayalam, in Tamil,
in Punjabi, in Gujarati. This was the place that you would encounter all
sorts of, this whole kaleidoscope of curries and bread from chapati to <em>roti kirai</em>.
You know it has been adopted by the Indians, to <em>appam</em>, to <em>parata</em> and
then there’s the terracotta yoghurt. Yoghurt in terracotta pots. And then
we also encountered fried quails. All produced by the various Indian communities
all along the stalls lining Kandahar Street.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then we have the <em>nasi padang</em>. We have – at one corner – Pariamman
at the other end of Kandahar Street, we have the Sabar Menanti family and
the spinoff of it is the Rumah Minang that we see today. So, there we have
that. And then there’s also number 51 Sultan Gate. But that is Rumah Jawa.
So, with the advent of the silver screen, all these arts, all these artists,
sort of transformed themselves and created a central kitchen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But central kitchen faces Kandahar Street. The central kitchen will create
a kitchen like a guild house where everybody has a role. So, for instance,
we have Jimmy – “You will go to the market”, and Gek Han – “You will do
the marination”, and then Tony will do the skewering of the meat and then
somebody else will make the gravy. And yet another group will take care
of the satay by 4 pm to sell to either the Alhambra Theater or to Rex.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Wow.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>So that was a central kitchen. So, we have Indian curry shops. We have
the Waroeng Nasi Padang, we have the Javanese Central kitchen, and not
to mention the two Hainanese <em>kopitiam</em> on both ends of Kandahar Street.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Okay, so we have Bussorah Street and we have Kandahar Street.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>And the third one would be Jalan Sultan. That’s the original home of your <em>sup tulang</em>.
When you make your mutton chop, when you don’t discard your <em>tulang</em>.
Somebody came up with this idea. What if we make this broth, this red-colored
broth out of it, and you can enjoy the bone marrow? So, it all started
over at Jalan Sultan. And over at Jalan Sultan as well they were selling
the popular <em>sup kambing</em>. Interestingly directly across there’s
also a Hainanese version of <em>sup kambing</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Really?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>With different spicing. And you’ll know the roles played by the Hainanese
in various, you know, the restaurants and homes. It’s interesting in Jalan
Sultan, as a kid growing up my grandpa would take me to this place, the
only place in Singapore that sold <em>mee odong</em>. And so there’s something
very distinct about this broth that they make to go with [the] <em>mee</em>,
the noodle. So, while working on this project I’ve realised that <em>mee odong</em> –
it’s a Malay corruption of “udon”.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>I see.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>Because the owner had worked with a Japanese family.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>It’s amazing. Okay, so we’ve covered three. Is there a fourth one?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>Fourth one. It has to be North Bridge Road. North Bridge Road is where
the – till today we’re very fortunate to still able to enjoy – the <em>murtabak</em> row,
there used to be three of them. All of them century-old establishments.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>This is Zamzam.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>Zamzam, Singapura and Victory. And then we have <em>briyani</em> houses
– so famous not just in Malaya. And those people from Jakarta would come
to enjoy, to want to enjoy Islamic and Jubilee <em>briyani</em> houses.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>You know, you talking about all this is just making me salivate, and I’ve
had lunch. That’s an amazing sort of food map of that area and I’m really
impressed. I understand why you say like you know it is like the incubator
of Malay cuisine. I mean there are all these influences and all these shops
and all these people that are all living in the area. And, so like <em>mee maidin </em>was
one of the original dishes that came out of Kampong Gelam. But what else
came out of Kampong Gelam? <em>Sup tulang</em>, you mentioned.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>Yes, <em>sup tulang</em> out of Jalan Sultan. There’s <em>mee siam.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Oh <em>mee siam</em> is also a Singapore dish? It’s not a Thai dish?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>It’s not a Thai dish, yeah, this is a long, stringy thing we call noodles.
As I mentioned earlier, it came to the Malay world through China, through
and from Siam. We have an 1820 colonial report by the port master about
how many tonnes of what produce arrived here. And here we have dried vermicelli
from Siam.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Wow. Okay. Okay.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>And you know dried vermicelli, the rice noodle, traveled well. Well, so
that’s <em>mee siam</em>. The raw ingredient. But the <em>mee siam</em>,
that concoction did happen in Kampong Gelam. While digging out material
thanks to our great libraries we have in Singapore, I stumbled upon this
report called <em><a href="https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/redir/itemdetails?bid=4979976" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">The Chemical Analysis of Foods of Singapore</a></em>.
Of course, the title sort of turns you off, the chemical analysis of food.
But actually, it was a colonial project to collate what was sold on the
streets of Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>When was this published?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>1940. So they went around, and they must have brought it to the laboratory.
And, of course, before that there must have been people watching because
judging by the various columns for every entry – let me give one example: <em>Mee siam</em> –
we are talking about <em>mee siam</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>My favorite dish. I love <em>mee siam</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>It is indicated: What would the ingredients involve? How to make, and
who prepared the food? Who makes the food? When is it sold? How much per
bowl?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>That’s very, very detailed.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>So, while we look at <em>mee siam</em>, there is support that it is Javanese.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Well, <em>mee siam</em> is Javanese?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>Made by urban Javanese, Singapore Javanese over in the Kampong Gelam area.
Once they acquired this flavour profile. They use <em>taucheo</em>. So,
the <em>tau</em> has really been introduced to the Malay world very early
on. Indeed, the first record of <em>tauhu</em> can be found in the temples
that lay in Java, dated 10th century.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Wow okay.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>So <em>taugay</em>, <em>tauhu</em>, <em>taucheo</em>, it’s has really been
part of the Nusantara staple you know? So, the Javanese in Singapore must
have experimented with <em>taucheo</em> using chives using this this <em>mee</em> vermicelli
and various other good ingredients. Of course, what turns up would be the
dried shrimp. And <em>tadah</em>, you have <em>mee siam</em> with the gravy.
So popular was this flavor profile that the folks around it created other
iterations and then we have the total of three types of <em>mee siam</em> that
came out of Kampong Gelam.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Which is the...&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>Dry <em>mee siam</em>, with a bit of a touch, you know, just drizzle [of
gravy]. There’s the gravy version. There’s another one. It’s also dry,
but it’s almost like the deconstructed version of <em>mee siam</em>. That
means instead of having the <em>hae bee</em>, the dried prawn, within the <em>mee siam</em>,
it is served as a floss, on the outside.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>That’s amazing. I don’t think I’ve had that one, but I need to maybe go
down to Kampong Gelam to look for it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>The last one that I mentioned, it’s gone, unfortunately.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Okay. So, I’m very sad. You’ve done, obviously, done a lot of research.
This map of Kampong Gelam and all the streets and all that. I mean, of
course, you grew up in Kampong Gelam, didn’t you? I mean, how old were
you? You know, how many years did you live in [Kampong Gelam]?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>Well, I was born in Kampong Gelam, and I was there till 14.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Okay.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>But the family is still there. I was there almost every day until the
building, the house where I lived in got acquired, yeah.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Well, what was it like growing, growing up in Kampong Gelam? You know,
back then?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>You know, I have vivid memories of the yearly Sufi festival over on Kandahar
Street. We have over on Telok Ayer Street, the Nakhor Dargha. But so Nakhor,
it’s a place in Tamil Nadu. So, the Tamil community, the Tamil-Muslim community
here would do an annual celebration of the Sufi saint, Shal Hamid. They
set up the shrine in Penang and in Singapore, but they have this annual
commemoration of this Sufi saint. In order to do that, they needed to raise
money. And I’ve seen with my own eyes how everybody chips in, regardless
of your background, my Chinese launderette would give money yearly to this
gentleman who went around collecting money from, you know, the Hindu neighbors,
and the money would be used to bring musicians from Tamil Nadu. And they
would have for three nights there’s this music festival, so much beautiful
drumming, music, dancing. Just like we see, you know the Sufi-istic kind
of dance.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Where did this happen?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>On Kandahar Street! Right, right on my five-foot way, in the building
that I grew up in.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Wow.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>As kids, we looked forward to every night that food would be given away.
So, me and my best friend, Ah Chong, whose father owned the Hainanese <em>kopitiam, </em>we
would wait so that we would get this packet of food and sweet meats and
so on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is also that, the publishing house. From my bedroom window, I could
see Pustaka Nasional. On Kandahar Street. So as kids, you know, we walked
around Kandahar Street, there’s Al-ahmadiya Press, I didn’t know I was
going to be a book collector. If I had known I would have gone and gotten
every copy, every first run of every book published by Al Ahmadiya Press
on Jalan Sultan. And there’s Haji Hashim Bookshop. But what I encountered
growing up, Jimmy, I think that was the sort of the remnants, the tail
end of this whole <a href="https://biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg/vol-13/issue-3/oct-dec-2017/early-malay-printing/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">publishing and printing business in Kampong Gelam</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Kampong Gelam, you know, it was a center for, you know printing and publishing,
and a centre for Malay intellectual life. And it also published a whole
bunch of books. And as you say, you’re now a book collector. Are there
any particular books that were published in Kampong Gelam that are particular
treasures of yours?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>Every time someone offers me a book from out of Kampong Gelam, I see that
not just as a book, I see that as an artifact. I have a whole stack of
the magazine on fashion. The first fashion magazine in Malay, written in
Jawi, started in 1951 or 1952. I have that, and I have a bunch of other
books that, I mean, it ranges from religious books or theology or religious
treatise. Comics in Jawi, and also classic literature. Persianate literature,
based on classic works by Hikail Amer Hamzah, I have that, and also Hikhail
Mohammed Hanafiah.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>You’re a serious book collector.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong>
<br>I think it’s important because it’s part of writing this book on food.
There’s a whole chapter on looking at food through <em>pantuns</em> and classic
text to understand food. I am really working on getting my hands on the
copy of <em>Hikayat Binatang</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br><em>Hikayat Binatang</em>?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>I was over at the Lenin Library in Moscow, and I saw a copy and I almost
jumped out of my skin, because it says Singapura 1840-something.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Where was it published?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>In Singapura, published in Kampong Gelam! So, I checked. I checked Ian
Proudfoot’s book on early printing in Singapore, and it was printed in
Kampong Gelam.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Well, I’ve never even heard of <em>Hikayat Binatang</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>So I thought it would be something like the Aesop’s Fables or something.
No, no, it’s a book on zoology.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Really? Wow. So, do you have a copy yet? Hopefully the library will have
a copy. Well, let me turn to your amazing book, <em><a href="https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/redir/itemdetails?bid=205498204" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">The Food of the Singapore Malays</a></em>.
I mean, it’s obviously a labour of love. I know it’s like 600 pages long.
It’s got amazing photographs, recipes. And maybe what’s more important,
the stories, right? &nbsp;Why did you want to put this book together? What
was so important about this that you spent many years on this?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>I spent 11 years on this. I lived in the Bay Area for 12 years, and each
time I came back to Singapore, for summer break and Christmas – I felt
– because when you are here, you don’t see the differences, the changes
– so, I felt there was a need to document, to do something serious, not
just a cookbook, not that a cookbook is not serious. There’s a place for
that. But I wanted it to be food ethnology. I wanted to use food to explain
a people. So, let’s take a look at the food of this group of people. That
was my main motivation, Jimmy.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>But I mean, like 11 years. What did you enjoy most about putting that
book together?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>I think what started off as a documentation project became a project to
celebrate the lives of the people, the custodians of these recipes and
[their] wisdom and knowledge. And, of course, it requires quite a bit of
research and I enjoyed doing that. Whether going to the library – you know
I traveled all the way to Leiden. I made three visits to Leiden. Leiden,
the Dutch library, is the largest repository of material from the Malay
world and, of course, the British Library, the Royal Asiatic Society, not
to forget our own National Library.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>The National Library. Yes, our own library. Wonderful place. I hope my
bosses are listening to how much I love the place. What was the research
process like? I mean, you said it’s under-researched and it can’t be easier
because people eat food. They don’t typically write about food.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>That’s the challenge because you don’t have it down in print. So that
requires you to interview as well. So, when you start doing that, you need
to have a certain methodology, right? How do you go about interviewing
who you interview, what exactly [do] you want to interview [about]? This
whole project can be divided into four parts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first part I wanted to talk about was people, space and place. So,
while you can talk about food and history – history is always debatable
– food and geography, <em>aha</em>! It is something that is hard for you
to argue. So, let’s look at geography. Let’s take a look at people, space
and place. So, the book is about the food of Singapore Malays. I thought
it’s really important to unpack right from the start what is a Malay, who
is a Malay? We’re not looking at sort of ethno-racial geography, but we’re
looking at a fluid space where so many diverse cultures come together.
And hence that is what we call the Malay world culturally.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>I realise that I know very little just sitting there and listening to
you. I realise the depths of my ignorance.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>This is something that I think we all know. We all know somehow. But what
I’ve done is actually make it, you know, make it more palatable. So, we
have this fourth section. There's a chapter on kitchen accoutrements and
implements. So, I need to interview because some of the objects have gone.
Take one example. <em>Putu piring</em>. So, we know a commercial version
of <em>putu piring</em>, big aluminum, but was <em>putu piring</em> ever served
at home? What would it look like? So, I needed to go down and interview,
and when you talk about interviewing people, elders, you are racing against
time.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>It is. You are right.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>The passing of an elder, of a grandmother, is like the closure of a library.
I go around interviewing libraries. Of course, these days we are very fortunate
to have digital searches.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Right.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>Thanks again to the NLB I can do research on Singapore newspaper archives.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Yeah <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">NewspaperSG</a> is
an excellent resource. Yes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>Go to the Australian University Malay concordance project. I type in <em>belachan</em> or <em>bungah</em>  <em>telang</em> and
out comes all the <em>bungah telang</em> information that you need to know.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Yeah, that is remarkable. If you want to check out what Khir’s done, <em>BiblioAsia</em> has
actually published the chapter on <a href="https://biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg/vol-17/issue-3/oct-dec-2021/theroleofforaging/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">foraging</a> in
an earlier issue of <em>BiblioAsia</em>. We’re very grateful you were able
to take time out to come to do this interview with us. What are you working
on now?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>Well, this project has been sort of my “lifetime project”. Some people
call it my baby. So, if it’s a baby, okay, the baby’s already out. But
what I want to see is the baby grow. I’m enjoying this growth. I’m enjoying
the discourse that’s happening right now. I’m seeing a change in how people
look at Malay Food.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the past, you tended to link, to associate Malay food with, maybe the
hawker center and suddenly you realise there’s a lot more to Malay food.
There’s so much sophistication; it’s multilayered. I think the book is
no longer a book, there is a movement. People now are ready to showcase
Malay food as a fine dining affair, people experimenting with new things.
People are remixing, not only experimenting to see. They retained the flavour
profile, the character.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Wow. Okay. Khir’s book is a joy. It is. It belongs on everybody’s bookshelf.
We’ve come now to the part of the interview where we ask questions that
are not necessarily related to the book, but, you know, more about Khir
himself. You know, if you lived in Kampong Gelam, if this was the 19th
century, what do you think you’d like to be? Would you like to be a writer,
a bookshop owner? What would you like to do if you weren’t doing what you’re
doing now?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>Well, let me see. Can my answer be related to what I’m doing now?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Absolutely.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>Let me think. What would I be doing if I had lived in Kampong Gelam in
the 19th century? I’m a collector, too. I collect musical recordings, I
collect textiles, I collect old books. There’s something about collecting
them in the 19th century. How about this? You know the expression. Cairo
writes, Beirut prints and Baghdad reads. So, Kampong Gelam in Singapore.
I want to be a collector. Singapore collects and preserves.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Okay, so you want to be a librarian?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>I want to be a librarian.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Okay, very good.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>I want to be a librarian. I want to collect and preserve. Yes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Wonderful. Wonderful. Let me ask you, you know, I love Malay food, by
the way. What do you think is the most maligned ingredient in Malay cooking?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>It has to be the poor coconut. The poor coconut that we enjoy so much.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Why?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>You know there’s all this notion about being unhealthy, about coconut
milk and yet look at the line for Katong <em>laksa</em>. Look at the line
for <em>nasi lemak</em>. There’s something that’s amiss. Here we are thinking
that it’s very bad, but you cannot make your <em>laksa</em> with soybean
or your cow’s milk or almond milk, you can’t do it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What makes it <em>laksa</em>? It’s the <em>lemak</em> that comes from the <em>santan</em>,
from the coconut cream and folks would also need to read this article great
that came out of the <em>New York Times</em> some time back. It’s called
“Once a Villain, Now a Hero”. So, the industry at one time told you that
coconut oil is bad. Look at the price of coconut oil now – the size of
your peanut butter jar – is 36 bucks. I don’t know. Or thereabouts? I grew
up trying everything in coconut oil. Until the industry tells you this.
There’s something else. It’s called vegetable oil, which is actually palm
oil. So, I think it’s been so maligned for coconut. But is it again, the
coconut? It’s just so wonderful. This from coconut oil, to coconut cream
and the coconut pulp itself, the kernel, there’s so much you can do.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>I wouldn’t have thought that coconut was maligned at all because I’m very
fond of it actually. When people buy your book, what is the one recipe
you would tell them to try out?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>Wow, that’s a tough one, Jimmy. Very, very, very hard. It’s like you have
10 kids and I ask you, Jimmy, which kid do you love most?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Okay, what if it’s for someone who, like, you know, has – I won't name
names – fried an egg and managed to burn his foot. What recipe would you
recommend to them to try?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>Well, let me see. Let me think. So, no frying involved. Now that you have
rephrased the question then I got to think of what would be easy to make… <em>mee siam</em>.
I mean it’s fairly easy. That’s not because you talked about <em>mee siam</em> already
earlier. So, let’s talk about something else.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br><em>Nasi lemak</em>. Another one of my favorites.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>So, lots of them. This bit. Quite a bit of dexterity and practice.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Okay, you know what? I think you’re too much of a perfectionist. I will
never be able to make any kind of good Malay food because clearly whatever
you know, your bar is very high.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>No, no. It’s not that my bar is very high. But I’m just trying to think
of something that, you know – I keep telling people the recipes have been
tested, retested and retested such that if you give it to anyone, give
it to a teenager, he or she should be able to cook and produce the food
the way it should be.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Okay. I will take you at your word, Khir, and I will allow your book in
my kitchen and I will make <em>mee siam</em> or <em>mee maidin</em> then and
if it doesn’t work out well, you know, I’ve got your number here. I’m going
to be knocking on your door.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>You feel free to do that.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Okay, last question. Complete this sentence. Food is...?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Khir</strong> 
<br>Hmm... Food is nourishment for the body and soul. A universal language
that brings people together and tells stories of culture and tradition.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong> 
<br>Okay, that’s beautiful. Yeah. You know, thank you Khir for joining us
