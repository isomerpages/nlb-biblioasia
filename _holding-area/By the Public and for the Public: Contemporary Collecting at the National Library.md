To&nbsp;put together an account of the past, historians typically go through things like manuscripts, letters, diaries, memoirs, documents and photographs. These primary sources provide the raw material from which historians reconstruct the past, which is why these items are carefully preserved by libraries, archives and museums all over the world.&nbsp; &nbsp;

However, these days, people document their lives using new media. While vivid and immediate, new media is also digital and ephemeral, which means libraries and archives need to find new ways to collect and preserve content and information.

The National Library, Singapore (NL) aims to address this through an initiative called Contemporary Collecting. This initiative looks at the acquisition and preservation of materials that represent not only our distant past, but also our recent history. These materials can be collected and contributed by individuals, organisations and institutions to capture the essence of life in the 21st century as we know it.

As part of this initiative, on 1 October 2023, NL launched a new online platform, “Singapore Memories: Documenting Our Stories Together”, where the public can contribute videos, audio clips, photographs and even social media accounts of present-day Singapore for posterity. It uses crowdsourcing – harnessing the collective efforts of the public – to quickly gather and build up a diverse record of the present.

#### **“Documenting Covid-19 in Singapore”**

The value of contemporary collecting can be readily appreciated through the National Library’s Covid-19 collection, comprising crowdsourced materials about the pandemic in Singapore.

Singapore saw its first case of Covid-19 on 23 January 2020, marking the start of stringent measures to contain the spread of the disease. Between 7 April and 1 June, the government imposed a “circuit breaker” period to pre-empt further transmissions. Schools, offices and most retail outlets were closed, and social gatherings prohibited.

To record and document the impact of&nbsp; Covid-19 on everyday life, NL partnered with the National Museum of Singapore on a project called “Documenting&nbsp; Covid-19 in Singapore” from 22 May 2020 to 30 June 2021. This was a collection drive for the public to contribute photographs, personal stories, videos, ephemera, web material and objects on their experiences during the pandemic.

More than 5,700 items were received, mainly digital photographs accompanied by brief descriptions or personal anecdotes, from some 470 individuals and organisations. It was timely to launch the collection drive during the partial lockdown as it enabled people to record and contribute scenes that were unique to that moment. There were many photographs depicting changes that people observed around them, such as shuttered retail shops and restaurants, deserted streets, and empty buses and trains, as well as the appearance of safe-distancing markers to guide people to keep at least one metre from each other to reduce the risk of virus transmission.&nbsp;

There were also shared snapshots of daily life reflecting how people adapted to the restrictions, how they found creative ways to spend time at home, and how they kept in touch with family and friends. Notably, the submissions also covered how the pandemic affected festive celebrations and important events such as weddings and births.&nbsp;

Yvonne Cheng and her husband welcomed their first child during the circuit breaker in May 2020. Cheng wote: “In doing our part to stay safe and stay home, even my husband’s mother (a first-time grandma) couldn’t visit and cuddle with him. The postpartum period has always been a time when family and emotional support are important, yet we can only connect virtually and be there for one another in a very different way than we have imagined.”
