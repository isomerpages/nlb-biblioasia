**About**:	Graceful Life Reading Club was founded with the vision of fostering collective growth amongst association members through the transformative power of literature, whilst simultaneously building bridges with other reading communities through shared literary experiences. Our book discussions encompass a thoughtfully diverse range of subjects, spanning literature, business, history, culture, economics, and technology, amongst other disciplines. Through these rich and varied reading experiences, we seek to help members discover and appreciate the inherent beauty of life in its many dimensions.
