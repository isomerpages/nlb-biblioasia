#### Singapore has emerged as a leading Asian fashion capital in recent years. **Zoe Yeo** tracks its evolution through fashion publications from the Legal Deposit Collection.

Among other things, Singapore’s multicultural and multi-ethnic society is reflected in the clothing we wear. The first ever official census conducted in 1824 recorded 10,683 residents, comprising 74 Europeans, 15 Arabs, 4,580 Malays, 3,317 Chinese, 756 Indian natives and 1,925 Bugis.[^1] When the intrepid 19th-century travel writer Isabella Bird first stepped foot in Singapore in 1879, she was amazed at how the city was “ablaze with colors and motley with costume” and how the attire worn by locals made up “an irresistibly fascinating medley”.[^2]

The fashion scene in Singapore today is starkly different from what Bird witnessed in the 19th century but one thing hasn’t changed: the Singaporean woman’s penchant for dressing well and keeping up with the latest fashion. Looking through the National Library’s Legal Deposit Collection of fashion magazines and books published in Singapore over the past several decades, one is able to study changing trends not only in dress, but also hair and makeup.

#### **Traditional Costumes**

Up until the 1950s, traditional attire was a common sight on the streets of Singapore. Wearing Western-style clothes was the preserve of those who had studied or travelled overseas, or who were wealthy enough to buy imported fashions sold at a handful of high-end boutiques.[^3]

<br><br>
	One of the statutory functions of the National Library Board Act is Legal Deposit. Under the act, all publishers, commercial or otherwise, are required by law to deposit two copies of every work published in Singapore with the National Library within four weeks of its publication. The Legal Deposit function ensures that Singapore’s published heritage is preserved for future generations. Legal Deposit also acts as a repository for published materials, providing exposure via the online catalogue, PublicationSG: catalogue.nlb.gov.sg/publicationsg. For more information, please visit www.nlb.gov.sg/Deposit.</span>
