On 26 September 1943, a team of Australian and British commandos and sailors launched a daring raid on Japanese ships in Singapore’s Keppel Harbour. The covert attack, called Operation Jaywick, has been retold in a comic book titled <i>[The Victor Book for Boys: The Commandos at Singapore](https://biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg/vol-19/issue-2/jul-sep-2023/operation-jaywick-comic-book-victor/)</i>.

Professor Yu Chun Yee previously taught at the Royal College of Music in London. At age 18, he won the prestigious Singapore Musical Society’s pianoforte competition in 1955 judged by Julius Katchen. Here, Yu plays on the recently refurbished Chappell grand once used by international pianists at the Victoria Memorial Hall. A cheaper replacement for the Memorial Hall’s old Steinway grand, the piano has a chequered history and was widely criticised for its tone. It is now a public piano at the National Library Building.
