#### From the first smallpox vaccine introduced in 1819 to the nationwide Covid-19 vaccination programme now underway, **Ong Eng Chuan** provides a quick history of vaccination efforts in Singapore since colonial times.

The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has cast vaccination into the spotlight as it helps to prevent the disease and reduce its spread. Being vaccinated is not a new concept in Singapore though. Most children here routinely get vaccinated against diseases such as measles and mumps.

Vaccinations for children are done under National Childhood Immunisation Schedule which is overseen by the Ministry of Health (MOH). It covers diseases such as tuberculosis, diphtheria, hepatitis B, measles, pertussis (whooping cough), pneumococcal infection, poliomyelitis, rubella (German measles) and tetanus. It does not stop with children either. Many adults take the influenza (flu) vaccine, especially before travelling to colder climates, as well as the pneumococcal and hepatitis B vaccines. The elderly and people with certain chronic conditions are strongly advised to have the flu jab regularly.

The highly organised way in which the Health Ministry handles the schedule for childhood vaccinations makes it seems like a very modern medical practice. However, vaccinations in Singapore actually have a long history. The very first vaccine – for smallpox – was introduced as early as December 1819.

##### **Smallpox and Vaccination in Early Singapore**
Until fairly recently, smallpox, which is caused by the variola virus, was a much-feared disease. It was highly contagious, had a high mortality rate and those who survived were often disfigured for life. Thanks to a concerted global campaign of vaccination, smallpox was eventually eradicated, and in October 1979, the World Health Organization (WHO) finally declared the world free of the disease.[^1] 

The first step towards eradicating smallpox began in 1796 when English doctor Edward Jenner used cowpox (a milder form of smallpox) to induce immunity against the more virulent smallpox.[^2] This smallpox vaccine was the first vaccine to be introduced in Singapore. 

In December 1819, Resident of Singapore William Farquhar wrote to officials in Penang to request for supplies of smallpox vaccine.[^3]  The vaccine was sent to Singapore and a Vaccine Department set up to administer the vaccination. However, this early attempt at a vaccination programme failed, and the Vaccine Department was abolished in 1829. Subsequent efforts also produced erratic outcomes and as a result, smallpox remained prevalent in Singapore, periodically breaking out into epidemic proportions, such as the 1838 episode which claimed hundreds of lives.[^4]  

These early vaccination programmes faltered due to the resistance from the local population.[^5]  Few residents came forth to be vaccinated and parents were also unwilling to send their healthy children to be vaccinated for fear of putting them at risk.

In its early form, vaccination was done using arm-to-arm transfer, getting pustular material from one vaccinated person to directly inoculate another person by scratching the material into the recipient’s arm.[^6]  This method needed a constant stream of people to help propagate the vaccine.

It was hard to obtain fresh vaccine lymph or material when the supply ran out. As Penang and Singapore did not produce the smallpox vaccine, fresh material had to be shipped from Calcutta.[^7]  However, the tropical climate made it difficult to maintain the shelf life of the vaccine so by the time the vaccines arrived here, their effectiveness would be compromised. 

The authorities made attempts to obtain vaccine lymph from other sources such as Batavia (now Jakarta) and the Royal Jennerian Institute in London (which would take six weeks to reach Singapore by ship), in the hope that these would give better results.[^8] 

In 1863, when the incidence of smallpox increased again, the government was urged to implement tougher measures, including making smallpox vaccination compulsory by law, following in the footsteps of the Dutch who had successfully introduced compulsory vaccination in the Dutch East Indies (present-day Indonesia).[^9] 

Stricter public health control measures were finally introduced after the Straits Settlements became a Crown Colony in 1867. The Quarantine Ordinance was passed by the Legislative Council in June 1868, followed by An Ordinance to Extend and Make Compulsory the Practice of Vaccination, which came into effect on 1 May 1869.[^10] 

The latter legislation led to the Ordinance for Registration of Births and Deaths of 1868. A register was necessary to keep track of the number of children to be vaccinated, and it was the responsibility of the Registrar to send notification to parents of newborns to vaccinate their children. It was also important to track deaths and their causes to gauge the success of the vaccination programme.[^11]

Smallpox continued to be a problem in Singapore up until the 1950s. After WHO declared the virus eradicated, Singapore amended the law so that from smallpox vaccination would no longer be required by law from March 1982.[^12]

##### **BCG and the Battle Against Tuberculosis**
At the end of World War II, Singapore found itself in another battle, this time against tuberculosis (TB). TB is an infectious disease caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria. There are two types of TB infections – latent TB infection and TB disease. People with the former show no symptoms and cannot spread the bacteria to others whereas people with the TB disease may spread the bacteria to others. If left untreated, TB can be fatal.[^13] 

In the aftermath of the Japanese Occupation (1942–45), the incidence of tuberculosis increased sharply, especially among young children. It was the number one killer disease right up to the 1960s.[^14]

The anti-tuberculosis vaccine, *Bacillus Calmette-Guérin* (BCG), had been developed by French scientists, Albert Calmette and Camille Guérin, in 1919. However, the vaccine only gained wider acceptance after studies began to appear in the 1940s providing evidence of its efficacy.[^15] 

The first large-scale BCG vaccination in Singapore was not carried out by government health authorities though. Instead, it was conducted by the Singapore Anti-Tuberculosis Association (SATA), a charity organisation. The idea of forming an organisation to fight TB had originated from a group of prisoners-of-war interned at Changi Prison and Sime Road Camp during the Japanese Occupation. Eventually, a group of doctors and philanthropists banded together to form SATA in 1947.[^16]

While government health officials were still reviewing the BCG vaccine, SATA, under its first medical director, G.H. Garlick, believed that providing children with protection against TB was an urgent task which could not wait.[^17]

After obtaining a small consignment of the BCG vaccine from the Pasteur Institute in Paris, SATA launched its immunisation programme on 28 June 1949, with the vaccination of 21 children.[^18] As new consignments of the vaccine began to arrive more regularly, SATA ramped up its vaccination drive.[^19]

Two years later, the government’s pilot BCG vaccination programme under the auspices of the United Nations International Children Emergency Fund (UNICEF) began. A UNICEF team started conducting tests on pupils of the Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus at Bras Basah Road in June 1951, with the aim of eventually vaccinating the majority of the 130,000 school children in Singapore within four months. That same year, inoculations of newborns began but these were discontinued in 1952 due to the “lack of staff to do follow-up work”.[^20] 

By 1956, the Singapore government realised that administering the BCG vaccine to children at school entrance age was too late as statistics showed that many children had been infected even before starting school. In December that year, the Health Ministry announced that all babies in Singapore would be given the BCG vaccine soon after birth. SATA’s Garlick approved. “The younger a child is inoculated the better,” he said. “T.B. is so rife here that many children become infected at a very early age.”[^21]

By 1972, after a period of 16 years, over one million vaccinations had been performed. It was estimated that more than 90 percent of infants and primary school students, and 75 percent of secondary school students had been inoculated against TB by 1972.[^22]

Students used to get booster jabs at age 12 or 16 but from 2001, this was discontinued as there was no scientific evidence that this was effective.[^23]

TB remains a global public threat and is still endemic in Singapore, with a higher proportion of the elderly contracting the disease. In 2020, there were 1,370 new cases of active TB among Singapore residents, slightly lower than the 1,398 cases in 2019.

##### **Polio, Diphtheria, Measles and Rubella**
During the post-war period, Singapore also had to deal with poliomyelitis, or polio, a crippling and life-threatening disease caused by the poliovirus. The virus is highly contagious and can infect a person’s spinal cord resulting in paralysis and can even lead to death. Although the disease affects people of all ages, infants and children are particularly vulnerable.[^24]

A major polio outbreak between August and December 1958 killed 12 and caused 404 infants and children to be crippled by the disease.[^25] As the number of polio cases continued to surge, there was added pressure on the government to act. Eventually, the Health Ministry decided to offer free polio vaccination on a voluntary basis to children between three months and 10 years old. 

In roughly four weeks from November to December that year, over 200,000 children were immunised using the oral Sabin vaccine (named after its developer, Albert Bruce Sabin) in vaccination centres set up across the island.[^26] However, this did not stop another outbreak from happening just two years later which resulted in 196 cases of paralytic poliomyelitis.

After the first outbreak, the government convened a committee to address the problem. The committee recommended vaccinating all children from birth to school entry age. The government approved the recommendation and the immunisation programme began with a mass campaign in 1962, when children up to 6 years old were vaccinated.

This led to a significant decline in the incidence of paralytic polio and polio cases in the following decade.[^27] By 1975, a large segment of the population had been immunised. This reduced the circulation of the poliovirus among the community to such a low level that the chances of any person being infected and developing paralytic poliomyelitis had been “reduced to vanishing point”.[^28]

Although Singapore was officially declared polio-free in 2000, vaccination against polio continued as the disease had not been eradicated worldwide. In 2019, some 1,000 Singapore athletes and officials headed to the Philippines for the SEA Games had to be vaccinated against polio when new cases of polio were reported in there, 19 years after the country had been declared free of polio.[^29]

Another potentially dangerous disease is diphtheria. This infectious disease is caused by the Corynebacterium diphtheriae bacteria. Diphtheria patients experience common symptoms such as sore throat and fever but in severe cases, infection can lead to difficulty in breathing, heart failure, paralysis and even death.[^30] Vaccination against diphtheria was developed in the early 1920s and was introduced in Singapore before World War II. After the Japanese Occupation, the government offered free vaccinations against diphtheria and other diseases such as pertussis (also known as whooping cough).[^31]

However, the response to the government’s voluntary immunisation programme was lukewarm. Despite having no diphtheria epidemics, the government decided to make diphtheria vaccination compulsory to reduced the number of increasing cases.
In 1961, the Legislative Assembly passed the Diphtheria Immunisation Ordinance making immunisation against diphtheria compulsory for all children under the age of 1. Parents or guardians who failed to comply with the law would be liable to a fine not exceeding $500 for the first offence and $1,000 and/or jail of not more than a year for subsequent convictions. Free vaccination was offered at 27 maternal and child health care clinics.[^32]

Today, diphtheria has been eradicated from Singapore although the disease is still endemic in many countries.[^33] In 2017, an isolated case of diphtheria occurred in Singapore in which a Bangladeshi construction worker died of diphtheria, the first local case in 25 years.[^34]

By 1970, the Maternal and Child Health Services was providing a comprehensive programme of vaccination against tuberculosis, smallpox, poliomyelitis, diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus through its network of 52 centres. In July that year, the government announced a new requirement that all children seeking admission to primary one in 1971 would have to be immunised against these infectious diseases.[^35]

During the 1970s, due to frequent outbreaks of measles and rubella (also known as German measles), inoculation against these two diseases was introduced into the childhood vaccination programme.[^36]

Measles is caused by the measles (rubeola) virus. Its symptoms include high fever, cough, watery eyes, and spots and rashes. However, measles is not just a little rash. It can be dangerous, especially for babies and young children as it can lead to serious complications such as pneumonia and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain).[^37]

Rubella is caused by its namesake virus. Most people who are infected develop a mild illness, but as with measles, rubella can result in serious complications. It can cause infected pregnant women to miscarry or their babies to develop serious birth defects.[^38]

Measles vaccination was introduced in October 1976, while rubella vaccination for female primary school leavers was introduced in November that year. However, many parents were still reluctant to vaccinate their children against measles because many held the traditional belief that it is good for children to get it since it rids the body of “heat” or “cold” that cause rashes.[^39]

Vaccination against the disease became compulsory by law on 1 August 1985. In January 1990, the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine replaced the single jabs for measles and rubella. Although the three-in-one vaccine was more expensive, Acting Minister for Health Yeo Cheow Tong said that “for the child, having one shot is better than having three shots”. This injection would be administered to infants who were at least a year old.[^40]

##### **Hepatitis B Vaccine and Foray into Biotechnology**
In the 1970s, hepatitis B was a serious public health problem. It was a disease that was endemic in Singapore and countries in the Asia-Pacific.[^41] The hepatitis B virus was first identified in the 1960s by American physician and geneticist Baruch S. Blumberg, who also developed the first vaccine for the disease. It soon emerged that this vaccine could help prevent a type of liver cancer called primary liver cancer.[^42] Studies showed that chronic hepatitis B carriers had a high risk of developing primary liver cancer, which was a common type of cancer in Singapore at the time. In 1979, it was reported that Singapore had the highest incidence of primary liver cancer in the world.[^43]

The association between hepatitis B and primary liver cancer fuelled a global race to produce the vaccine on a commercial scale. The Singapore government was also interested in the commercial production of the hepatitis B vaccine as the biotechnology industry was seen as an economically viable new industry. Unfortunately, the vaccine production plan was eventually scrapped because the projected returns did not justify the $20 million investment required for the project. 

Although the scheme to produce the hepatitis B vaccine in Singapore was derailed, the fight against hepatitis did not stop. As early as 1983, 600 medical staff from MOH and NUS became the first to receive the anti-hepatitis B vaccine as the government waged an all-out-war against the disease. Due to the high cost, the vaccination programme targeted selected population groups who were at higher risks of acquiring the disease, such as babies of infected and carrier mothers, health care workers and national servicemen.[^44]

On 1 September 1987, a vaccination-at-birth service was rolled out to vaccinate all newborns in Singapore at a reduced fee. At the time, there were 140,000 hepatitis B carriers in Singapore, and the government wanted to ensure that the disease would not spread to the rest of the population. Singapore was also one of the few countries in the world to make the hepatitis B vaccination available to all newborns.[^45]

By 2000, more than 90 percent of infants had received the hepatitis B vaccination. While this age group was well protected against hepatitis B, about half of Singapore’s adult population had no immunity against the virus. In 2001, MOH launched a four-year hepatitis B immunisation programme for students in secondary schools, junior colleges, centralised institutes, the Institute of Technical Education, polytechnics and universities.[^46]

Since the introduction of the hepatitis B immunisation programme in Singapore, the annual incidence of acute hepatitis B infection has declined from eight cases per 100,000 population in 1987 to 3.6 per 100,000 population in 2000. The nation’s research findings and experience on implementing a national hepatitis B vaccination programme were shared internationally. In 2001, WHO also endorsed the long-term safety and effectiveness of the hepatitis B vaccine and recommended that it be implemented in all endemic countries and for all newborns.[^47]

##### **Vaccinating Against Covid-19**
As Singapore, and the world, struggles to contain the spread of Covid-19, vaccination has emerged as a key weapon in the fight.

Singapore has already begun vaccinating its population, having approved the emergency use of vaccines by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. Vaccinations began in December 2020 and as at 14 June 2021, close to 2 million people have been fully vaccinated while 2.7 million have received at least one dose.[^48]

On 31 May 2021, the government announced that vaccines that have been approved for emergency use by WHO against Covid-19 can also be used in Singapore as well. At the moment, the list includes the vaccines by Johnson & Johnson, Sinovac and Oxford-AstraZeneca. This move will increase the pool of vaccines available for use here.[^49]

As Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in his address to the nation on 31 May 2021, when a large proportion of Singapore’s population is vaccinated, more restrictions can be lifted safely and gradually so that a semblance of normal life can return even as the virus becomes endemic here. [^50]
