#### **The Singapore Youth Orchestra’s practice of commissioning and performing the works of local composers was instrumental in the growth of Singapore music.**
By Vivien Goh

When the Singapore Youth Orchestra (SYO) was formed in 1980, part of its mission was to be a feeder to the Singapore Symphony Orchestra which had been set up the year before. However, in addition to nurturing young musicians, the orchestra’s other major contribution to Singapore was to feature the works of local composers. The founding chairman of the board of SYO, Bernard Tan, noted that the intention of the orchestra was to “show our support for Singaporean composers and to build up a body of Singapore works. No other music group, as far as I know, was doing this at the time.” This allowed Singapore composers to get their works performed while also exposing SYO members to local composers.[^1]

“I would like to think that our policy acted as a strong catalyst for Singapore composers to write orchestra works, and also served as an important showcase for them,” he added. “It also encouraged other music groups to perform the works of Singapore composers.”[^2]
