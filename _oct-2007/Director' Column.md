It has been two years since we moved to the new National Library Building at Victoria Street. In the last two years, the National Library had played host to several overseas distinguished guests. These include her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II; Japanese Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko; the former Crown Prince of Bhutan, His Royal Highness, Trongsa Penlop Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, and Mrs Laura Bush, First Lady of the United States.

I am happy to say that we have done reasonably well in a short span of time. To commemorate the re-opening of the National Library, we first published the inaugural issue of *BiblioAsia* in August 2005 and this is now the 10th issue. We also launched two permanent exhibitions at the National Library in November 2005. The first exhibition, *The Singapore Literary Pioneers Gallery*, pays tribute to the literary achievements of prominent Singapore writers. The second exhibition, *From Books to Bytes: The Story of the National Library*, visually celebrates the history of the National Library from 1823 to the present. Do come and visit these exhibitions if you have not done so!
