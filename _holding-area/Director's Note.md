As some of you would’ve noticed, we recently installed a public piano in the lobby of the National Library Building and it’s been a wonderful addition to the space. Every day, someone will slide up to the concert grand to play a tune, whether it’s a classical piece or a pop song. There’s just something about music that makes us want to sing and dance. This remarkable ability of music to move us goes a long way to explain why [Talentime](/vol-19/issue-4/jan-mar-2024/talentime-history-singapore/), the local talent show, struck a chord with Singaporeans between the 1960s and 1980s. Jamie Lee and Mark Wong’s duet is a fitting tribute to a show that once ruled the airwaves.

Back in 1973, Karen Carpenter sang about how she’d listen to the radio waiting for her favourite songs while Elton John remembered when rock was young. That was also the year that Patricia Chan, Heather Merican and Glory Barnabas helped everyone stand taller thanks to their exploits at the [7th Southeast Asian Peninsular Games](/vol-19/issue-4/jan-mar-2024/seventh-seap-games-1973/) that were held in Singapore. Lim Tin Seng’s account of their achievements is a commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the games as well as a fitting way to mark Shanti Pereira’s amazing performance at this year’s Asian Games in Hangzhou.

On a more sombre note, it was 60 years ago that a car bomb exploded in Sennett Estate, killing two bystanders. The two men who died were the first victims of the bombing campaign in Singapore that was part of [Konfrontasi](/vol-19/issue-4/jan-mar-2024/singapore-malaysia-indonesia-konfrontasi-confrontation/). Unfortunately, more innocents would perish before a peace treaty was signed in 1966. Alvin Tan uncovers the gruesome details of this undeclared war.

While even undeclared wars have armies, not all armies fight literal wars. One well-known army that sees a different kind of battle is the [Salvation Army](/vol-19/issue-4/jan-mar-2024/salvation-army-singapore/), a Protestant church and charitable organisation whose roots in Singapore go back to the 1930s. Lee Geok Boi recces the situation to trace how the Army fought to provide a better life for young men and women in need, and how the Army reacted when faced with an actual hostile army during the Japanese Occupation.&nbsp;

This issue also looks at what happened when officials of the [Qing Imperial Court](/vol-19/issue-4/jan-mar-2024/qing-ambassadors-guo-song-tao/) visited Singapore in 1876, the achievements of footballer [Chia Boon Leong](/vol-19/issue-4/jan-mar-2024/chia-boon-leong-football-soccer/), the challenges of [restoring classic Asian films](/vol-19/issue-4/jan-mar-2024/restoring-asian-films/), a history of [Malay comic books](/vol-19/issue-4/jan-mar-2024/early-malay-comics/), the life of the late architect [William Lim](/vol-19/issue-4/jan-mar-2024/william-lim-archictect-w-associates/), and what inspired Rachel Heng to write her critically acclaimed novel, [_The Great Reclamation_](/vol-19/issue-4/jan-mar-2024/interview-rachel-heng/).

As you can see, we spare no effort to unearth great stories for your reading pleasure. Enjoy!











_Emily of Emerald Hill_ by playwright Stella Kon has touched the hearts of thousands who have watched it performed on stage over the last 40 years. Even though it is one of Singapore’s most popular plays, there is still much about it that many people don’t know. Few people, for instance, know that Stella almost named the monodrama _Betty of Balmoral Road_.&nbsp;

This fact only came to light recently thanks to research done by academic Eriko Ogihara-Schuck who wrote about the play for this magazine. She was able to discover this, and other nuggets of information, because Stella had donated the older drafts of her play to the National Library in 1987. Eriko’s article showing how [_Betty of Balmoral Road_ evolved into _Emily of Emerald Hill_](/vol-20/issue-2/jul-sep-2024/emily-of-emerald-hill-stella-kon/) amply demonstrates why it is vital for writers to donate their works to the National Library (hint, hint).

Resources available at the library (and the archives) enable us to rediscover things that have largely been forgotten. Everyone is familiar with the Causeway linking Singapore and Johor of course, and its infamous jams. But how many people know that the Causeway was built with a channel on the Malaysian side to allow small ships to pass through? An enormous bridge was erected over the channel that could be raised to allow ships to gain passage. To celebrate this year’s 100th anniversary of the land link, see wonderful photos of this bridge (and channel) in our excerpt from a book about the Causeway, published by the National Archives of Singapore and the National Archives of Malaysia in 2011.

There are too many interesting stories in this issue for me to do all of them justice here. I would like to highlight just three others. Beloved by punters and popular with the ladies, Tan Teng Kee, more popularly known as Battling Key, was one of Singapore’s earliest boxing stars. Alas, his story had a tragic ending, which researcher Abhishek Mehrotra vividly recounts in his fascinating piece on local boxing in the 1920s.

I’m also pleased that this issue delves into the life of Hajah Asfiah Haji Abdullah, a teacher who helped preserve Malay heritage by conducting classes on traditional crafts and writing a book on Malay cooking. An amazing woman who began teaching classes at the age of 10, she dedicated herself to keeping Malay traditions alive. Her story deserves to be better known and librarian Toffa Abdul Wahed’s profile of her goes a long way in ensuring that Hajah Asfiah’s memory lives on.

Finally, as this note is being written, Southeast Asia is experiencing a heatwave. You might then be interested to read about the history of ice-making in Singapore. Just imagine not being able to indulge in ice kacang or ice-cream, or going to a market and buying fish that hasn’t been put on ice. The thought of living without ice is enough to send shivers down my spine.
