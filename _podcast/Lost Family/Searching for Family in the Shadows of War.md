<p>Jan Beránek sets out to find out what happened to his granduncle, Silvestr
Němec, who left his Czech village for Singapore in 1938 and died as a volunteer
during WWII. He finds Silvestr’s story woven with that of the Bata Shoe
Company, the Czechoslovak community and volunteer forces in Singapore.</p>
