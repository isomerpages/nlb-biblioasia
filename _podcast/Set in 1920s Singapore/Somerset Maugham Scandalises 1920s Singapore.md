---
<p>Sharing the literary landscape with contemporaries like D.H. Lawrence
and Virginia Woolf, W. Somerset Maugham (1874–1965) travelled to Singapore
in 1921. Though he was already well-known as a writer then, it was his
stay in Singapore that inspired some of his most celebrated short stories.
Crime fiction writer&nbsp;Tracey&nbsp;Morton tells us how Singapore inspired
his works, why they remain relevant, and whether the Menendez brothers
deserve their sentence.</p>
