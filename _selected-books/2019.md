The book showcases 28 historically significant documents, records and artefacts in Singapore’s early development, tracing its history from the earliest records of the island up to its establishment as a British Crown Colony on 1 Apr 1867. Complemented by insightful essays, this rich collection of materials from the National Library and National Archives of Singapore, and various international institutions invites us to not only appreciate the diversity of Singapore’s documentary heritage, but also challenge us to interrogate the personalities, societies and political forces behind the items.

This book — written by Dr John Bastin, a leading authority on the study of Sir Stamford Raffles — offers an alternative biographical account of Raffles, as seen through his relationship with some of his closest friends and contemporaries. Examining Raffles and his social circle presents an original perspective of the man and of the colonial world in which he lived, and his correspondence with his friends and scientific colleagues reflects his attitude and opinions on a range of issues, including his desire to extend the benefits of education.
