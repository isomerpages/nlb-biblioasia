#### **Episode summary** ####
You’ve most likely eaten _otak-otak_ wrapped in banana leaves, but have you tried _otak blangah_ – fishcake cooked in a clay pot? _Blangah_ in Malay means “clay cooking pot”, hence the name of the dish.

Join Tanya Pillay-Nair and Aunty Danam as they cook up a storm to make this unique Peranakan dish. Learn more about the Chitty Melaka community and how food is prepared for _Parachu_ (ancestral worship). Watch as Tanya and Aunty Danam show us how to prepare an _ikan parang_ (wolf herring) for the fishcake. It involves a minor tug-of-war!
