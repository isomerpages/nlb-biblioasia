#### **Lee Meiyu** looks back at the life of rubber tycoon Tan Lark Sye, long-time chairman of Hokkien Huay Kuan and the founder of the former Nanyang University in Singapore.

In October 2019, a ceremony was held at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) to mark the renaming of a road. Originally called Nanyang Valley, the small road leading to the Chinese Heritage Centre was renamed Tan Lark Sye Walk at an event attended by then Minister for Education Ong Ye Kung. [^1]

The new road name commemorates the efforts of a man who was the driving force behind the setting up of Nanyang University, a predecessor institution of NTU. Nantah, as it was known, was set up as a result of the rubber tycoon’s vision, determination and personal interest. He mooted the idea for the university in the early 1950s, pledged to personally donate $5 million to it, and was the first chairman of the university’s executive committee, a role he held for almost a decade.

The setting up of Nantah was a major point of pride for the Chinese community in Malaya. Thanks to Tan’s tireless efforts on behalf of the university, his name became indelibly linked with the institution. Unfortunately, Tan’s advocacy on behalf of Nantah was one of the reasons that led him into conflict with the government, culminating in his Singapore citizenship being revoked in 1964 following an inquiry into his political activities.

Although Tan ceased to be a citizen, he chose to continue living here. He focused on his businesses until his death from a heart attack about a decade later. Nantah soldiered on until 1980, when it merged with the University of Singapore to form the National University of Singapore. The next year, Nanyang Technological Institute (NTI) was set up on the premises of Nantah, and in 1991, it was renamed NTU.[^2]

##### Building a Business Empire
Although Tan was one of the key figures behind the founding of Nantah, he himself did not have much formal education. Tan was born in 1897 in the town of Jimei, part of Tong’an county, in China’s Fujian province. The sixth of seven brothers, Tan was orphaned as a child. He spent a few years at Jimei School, which had been set up by Tan Kah Kee, a prominent businessman and community leader in Singapore, who had also hailed from the same town.

In 1916, the 19-year-old Tan left China for Southeast Asia and found employment at one of the companies founded by Tan Kah Kee. The capable young man later worked in the latter’s Khiam Aik rubber factory in Singapore[^3], and after amassing enough capital and experience, decided to strike out on his own. In 1923, at the age of 26, Tan started Lian Hoe Rubber Shop with one of his older brothers, which was incorporated as Aik Hoe Rubber Company in the following year. 

Thanks to Tan’s business acumen, Aik Hoe became one of the leading players in the rubber trade and by 1938, the company had business interests throughout Southeast Asia as well as agencies in New York and London. In October 1938, Aik Hoe was reorganised as a private limited company with a registered and paid-up capital of $1 million. 

Apart from rubber, Tan was also involved in the finance, paper and cement industries. He set up Asia Insurance Company and Overseas Union Bank together with Lien Ying Chow, and served as a director of Oversea-Chinese Bank and chairman of Chiyu Banking Corporation Ltd in Hong Kong. Two of his companies, Lima Paper Products Co. Ltd and Tasek Cement Co. Ltd., were listed on the stock exchanges of Singapore and Malaysia.
