#### **Introduction**
Amid the booming newspaper industry and active Chinese literary scene
in Singapore after the Second World War, two editors of newspaper literary
supplements stood out for their contributions: Xing Ying (杏影; 1911–67)
and Yao Zi (姚紫; 1920–82). The supplements under their editorship were
influential and informed local literary trends in the 1950s and 1960s.
Newspaper supplements played a significant role in promoting literature
and literary aesthetics and developing local literary talent, because they
were published more frequently than literary magazines and had a wider
audience.[^1] They typically appeared as a half-page section near the end of the
newspaper. For budding writers, these supplements served as a springboard
to the more prestigious literary magazines.[^2] 

This paper discusses the editorial styles of Xing Ying and Yao Zi
and their contributions to the literary scene in Singapore, such as the
multicultural elements they introduced to the supplements, and their
nurturing of young writers. The first section describes the postwar Chinese
literary scene and the two editors’ backgrounds. Section two focuses on Yao
Zi’s early newspaper supplement, *Lü Zhou* (绿洲, *Oasis*, November 1952–
January 1953), and Xing Ying’s *Wen Feng* (文风, *Literary Trends*, January
1954–August 1958), analysing their differing editorial styles and literary
approaches. The third section compares their mature literary supplements:
Yao Zi’s *Shi Ji Lu* (世纪路, *Century Road*, October 1953–January 1954) and
Xing Ying’s *Qing Nian Wen Yi* (青年文艺, *Youth Literature and Arts*, July
1960–February 1967). The last section focuses on the literary supplements,
*Zhou Mo Qing Nian* (周末青年, *Weekend Youth*, November 1952–December
1952) in *Lü Zhou*, and *Xin Miao* (新苗, *New Sprouts*, March–August 1958) in
*Wen Feng*. This section will also elaborate on the creation of new platforms
for amateur writers and compare the editors’ responses to young readers. 

#### **The Postwar Singapore Chinese Literary Scene, 1945–60**
In the early postwar period from 1945 to 1948 – known as the initial
period of peace or recovery (和平初期/光复初期) – the Singapore Chinese
literary scene flourished.[^3] Newspapers such as *Sin Chew Jit Poh* (星洲日报),
*Nanyang Siang Pau* (南洋商报) and *Min Pao* (民报), as well as literary
supplements like *Chen Xing* (晨星) and *Feng Xia* (风下), were revived.
Literary organisations and drama groups resumed their publications and
performances, adding to the vibrant arts scene.

A turning point came in 1948. In a bid to fight the communists in
Malaya, the British colonial government declared a state of emergency.
Newspapers such as *Min Sheng Pau* (民生报) and *Nan Chiao Jit Pao* (南侨
日报) closed down, many books from China were banned, and publications
in Malaya and Singapore were censored. The number of newspapers and
publications in Singapore dropped by about 14 percent, from 140 between
1945 and 1948, to 121 between 1949 and 1954. The control of literature and the arts led to a paucity of reading materials[^4] and the dampening of the
literary scene.

At the same time, this sociopolitical environment gave rise to a cultural
phenomenon known as “yellow culture” (黄色文化). Yellow culture refers
to activities and behaviour perceived as degenerate, such as dance clubs,
gambling and pornography.[^5] In October 1953, in what was seen as a tragic
consequence of yellow culture, a 16-year-old girl was raped and killed
at Pearl’s Hill. A public outcry ensued. Cultural institutions, student
organisations and schools organised anti-yellow culture campaigns, and
students from Chinese schools such as Chung Cheng High School and
The Chinese High School initiated the slogan, “Resist yellow culture”
(抵制黄色文化). The anti-yellow culture movement (反黄运动) received
widespread public support.

The movement was another turning point in the development of
Chinese literature and newspapers in Singapore. New compositions such
as songs, dramas, novels and poems emerged, many of which stressed the
importance of a healthy mind,[^6] in opposition to the corrupting influence of
yellow culture. The number of literary works increased by 25 percent, from
113 before the anti-yellow culture campaign, to 142 in 1955.[^7] In the same
year, there were 414 Chinese newspapers and publications, more than twice
compared to 163 in the prewar period from 1837 to 1941.[^8]

The vibrant Chinese literary and newspaper scene in the 1950s can be
attributed to three reasons. First, the British colonial government relaxed its regulations on publications. Except for those championing extreme anti-government
views, all other publications could be registered with licences.
This led to a resurgence of publishing activity, including materials with
“yellow” elements. Second, the increased rigour in Chinese education in the
1950s led to a larger readership for Chinese newspapers, which were more
affordable for the masses. Third, the import ban on publications from China
and Taiwan meant a scarcity of reading materials for Singapore’s Chinese
intellectuals, who thus turned to local Chinese newspapers.[^9]

The 1950s also saw local Chinese beginning to reassess their affiliation
with Singapore vis-à-vis China. In 1955, the People’s Republic of China
announced that overseas Chinese would not be allowed to hold dual
nationalities. Local newspapers reflected the shifting sentiments of the day,
with interest clearly moving from China affairs to local developments.[^10] 
Articles on issues in China accounted for 69.7 percent of news coverage
in 1946, but declined to 22.5 percent by 1950, while articles related to
Singapore and Malaya rose from 19 percent in 1946 to 84.3 percent in 1959.[^11] 
During this period, the newspaper literary supplements edited by Yao Zi
and Xing Ying began to publish discussions on local issues and feature
multicultural elements.

#### ***Xing Ying and Yao Zi***
Xing Ying was the pen name of Yang Shou Mo (杨守默; birth name
Yang Fang Jie 杨芳洁). Born in Sichuan province, China, in 1911, he was
exposed to several different cultures in his youth. He received his secondary
education in Japan and studied English literature at Waseda University
in Tokyo. At 30, he was employed by the Allied Forces headquarters in
India, on account of his fluent Japanese, and wrote articles published
in the *Calcutta China Times*.[^12] After the war, he moved to Singapore in
1946, working as a translator at *Nanyang Siang Pau* and as a teacher at The
Chinese High School. Prior to joining *Nanyang Siang Pau*, Xing Ying had
little experience in editing and translation, and had rejected an offer to be
the editor of the literary supplement, *Lü Zhou*. He eventually took over editorship of *Wen Feng*, the literary supplement of *Nanyang Siang Pau*, in  1954. Not only was he successful in his journalism career, Xing Ying was a
good prose writer and wrote books such as *While You Are Young* (趁年轻的
时候, 1958), *Books and People* (书与人, 1960) and *Century of the Fools* (愚人的
世纪, 1960), etc. He also contributed regularly to the literary supplements,
*Lü Zhou* and *Shi Ji Lu*, both edited by Yao Zi. Xing Ying passed away in
1967 from illness at Singapore General Hospital at the age of 55.

Yao Zi, whose birth name was Zheng Meng Zhou (郑梦周), was born in
Fujian province, China. As a student, he edited a small newspaper, *Jiang Tao*
(江涛). He subsequently became an editor at *Jiang Sheng Daily* (江声日报)
in China, before coming to Singapore in 1947, where he taught at Tao Nan
School and Jin Jiang School. In 1949, his debut novel, *Miss Hideko* (秀子姑
娘), sold 16,000 copies in a single month; his subsequent novels in the 1950s
and 1960s, such as *The Lure of Coffee* (咖啡的诱惑) and *Storm* (风波), were
also popular. Yao Zi wrote under at least six different pen names in Shi Ji
Lu. He was an editor at *Nanfang Evening Post* (南方晚报) from 1952 to 1953,
*Nanyang Siang Pau* from 1953 to 1954, and *Shin Min Daily News* (新明日报)
from 1969 to 1977. Yao Zi passed away in 1982, at age 62.

#### **International Literature and Communication between Editors and Readers: Lü Zhou and Wen Feng**
*Lü Zhou* and *Wen Feng*, edited by Yao Zi and Xing Ying respectively, are
considered the two early literary supplements of the 1950s. The two men had
different editorial philosophies. Yao Zi’s focus on literary aesthetics likely
stemmed from his literary values as a novelist, and under his editorship, *Lü Zhou* published both international and local literature. Xing Ying focused
on developing young writers, and with *Wen Feng*, he created a vibrant
supplement that allowed greater interaction between readers and the editor.
In *Lü Zhou* and *Wen Feng*, Yao Zi and Xing Ying honed their respective
editorial styles, which became amplified in their later supplements.

***Lü Zhou: Bringing Literary Aesthetics into the Nanyang Literary Scene***

Yao Zi was the editor of the literary supplement *Lü Zhou* in *Nanfang
Evening Post* from 15 November 1952 to 3 January 1953, editing a total of 33
issues. *Lü Zhou* published news on regional literature and introduced local
writers, including Xing Ying and Wei Bei Hua (威北华), both of whom later
became renowned writers and editors. *Lü Zhou* was Yao Zi’s first edited
local literary supplement. In his first editorial in 1952, he wrote with palpable optimism that “hope brings light and joy to life”, and “one can hope for a
better tomorrow”.[^13]

<img src="/images/COA%202021/Chinese%20Newspaper%20Literary/L__Zhou_____9_December_1952_.jpg" style="width:80%;">
 <div style="background-color: white;">   <i>Lü Zhou</i> 绿洲, 9 December 1952, 3. (Microfilm NL3714) </div>

Yao Zi was responsible for publishing a variety of genres in a single
issue. For example, the 9 December 1952 issue of *Lü Zhou* (Figure 1) contains
(1) a short story by himself, (2) a serial novel by local writer Yu Sha (余莎),
(3) a translated review of works by the Russian writer Ivan Turgenev, (4) a
regular column featuring Indonesian poems in translation, (5) a poem by
Wei Bei Hua, (6) an essay by Li Qi (里奇) (one of Xing Ying’s pen names),
and (7) international literary news.[^14]

*Lü Zhou* usually relied on a few good writers for regular contributions.
One of these regulars was Wang Ge (王葛),[^15] a talented Malayan known
for his novels and essays. *Lü Zhou* published his novels[^16] such as *Mimosa*
(含羞草), *Sail* (帆) and* Fog* (雾), his
poem titled “Shell” (贝壳), and even
his translation of the English naturalist
Gilbert White’s 1789 essay on swallows.[^17]
Several of the young regular contributors
later became important writers. For
instance, Zhao Xin (赵心), better known
as Zhao Rong (赵戎), contributed many
pieces of literary reviews and criticism,
and Xing Ying’s essays and novels written
under the pen name Li Qi appeared in
almost every issue of *Lü Zhou*.[^18]

Yao Zi broadened the horizons of
local readers by introducing regional
and international literature in *Lü Zhou*.
A column was dedicated to poetry from
Indonesia (Figure 2); featured works
included “Vigil” (守夜), “A Lie” (欺瞒),
“Last Night” (昨夜) and “Palace” (王宫).[^19]
The poems were chosen and translated
by Yue Zi Geng (越子耕), better known
by his other pen names, Wei Bei Hua and Lu Bai Ye (鲁白野).[^20] Such columns introducing Indonesian and Malay
literature to Chinese readers were quite a common sight in the newspaper
literary supplements of the 1950s..[^21]

in <i>Lü Zhou</i> 绿洲, 5 December 1952, 3. (Microfilm NL3714)</div>

Each issue contained translated Western literary works, such as the
poem, “A Slave’s Dream” (一个奴隶的梦), by the American poet Henry
Wadsworth Longfellow and translated by Lin Qiu (林酋), and “The
Petrified Forest” (大自然的反攻) by American playwright R. E. Sherwood
and translated by Ai Li (艾骊)..[^22] The 26 November 1952 issue featured an
excerpt of a short story by French writer Henry Bordeaux, and an article,
“Centenary of Gogol’s Death” (果戈里百年祭) translated by He Lan
(河兰)..[^23]

*Lü Zhou* also introduced readers to contemporary writers from around
Asia. In the issue of 19 November 1952, an article was published on the
Korean writer Jang Hyeok-Ju and his new poem “Alas, Korea”..[^24] Works
by Lü Lun (侣伦; 1911–88; birth name Li Lin 李霖), a famous novelist and
screenwriter in Hong Kong, were featured prominently in the column,
Honeyed Notes (蜜叶记语); they included pieces such as “The Sign of a
Book Owner” (书主的标志), “Memory of the Moon” (月之忆) and “Black
Tea” (红茶)..[^25]

Yao Zi introduced a column, International Literary News (国际文坛消
息), edited by Di Jun (谛君). Rare for a Chinese newspaper supplement in the 1950s, this column exposed readers to developments in the worldwide
literary scene. Articles covered a wide range of events and topics, such as
“Belgium Issues Stamps Commemorating Writers” (比国发行作家纪念邮票),
“Venice Establishes Literary Award among Nine Countries” (威尼斯创立
九国文学奖), “Children’s Literature in Argentina” (阿根廷的儿童文学) and
“Puppets in Italy” (木偶人在意大利)..[^26] The column also featured articles
on international writers and literary reviews, including “The Experience
of a Reporter cum Writer: François Mauriac” (新闻记者兼作家的莫里亚
克略经历), written by Di Jun,.[^27] and a review, “Turgenev and His Works”
(屠格涅夫及其作品), by the Irish writer Robert Lynd and translated by
Yuan Si (原思). That the review was published in full over three issues of Lü
Zhou was telling of the significance Yao Zi placed on the Russian writer.
“The works of Turgenev,” he wrote, “are among the greatest in modern
world literature.”.[^28]

***Wen Feng: Xing Ying and His Communication Tool with Readers***

Xing Ying was the editor of *Wen Feng* in *Nanyang Siang Pau* from 18
January 1954 to 15 August 1958, during which 828 issues of the supplement
were published. In the first two years, *Wen Feng* was published daily;
after 1956, its publication became less regular, partly because of its narrow
thematic scope – almost half of the works revolved around the lives of
rubber plantation workers, employer-employee relationships, and the
difficulties of finding employment.[^29]

Unlike Yao Zi, who focused on publishing highly aesthetic literary
works, Xing Ying used *Wen Feng* to encourage literature-loving youths
to write freely,[^30] in line with his belief that journalism was a meaningful profession because journalists “can effect change in society with a pen”.[^31]
*Wen Feng*’s emphasis on youth writing marked a clear change from the
direction of its predecessor, *Shi Ji Lu*, under Yao Zi’s editorship. Xing
Ying welcomed all writers, accepted articles based on the strength of their
content, and proscribed personal attacks. The contributors came from
different backgrounds, bringing a diversity of perspectives to *Wen Feng*.
Some were professional writers, teachers and civil servants, while others were
factory workers, gardeners, students or unemployed amateur writers.

Like *Lü Zhou*, *Wen Feng* published works across a wide range of literary
genres, including poems, novels, essays, literary reviews and social criticism,
often accompanied by woodblock prints.[^32] Translated works were also
frequently featured, such as the short story “The Selfish Giant” (自私的巨
人) by the Irish writer Oscar Wilde and translated by Wei Ding (惟丁).[^33]
Under Xing Ying’s initiative, *Wen Feng* published special issues dedicated
to individual writers. The 19 October 1954 special issue commemorating
the Chinese writer Lu Xun (魯迅) featured poems and literary criticism on
his works, and a woodblock print inspired by his novella, *Ah Q*. Lu Xun’s
portrait was featured in *Wen Feng*’s title plate for that issue (Figure 3).[^34]

<div style="background-color: white;"><i>Wen Feng</i> 文风, Special commemorative issue on Lu Xun, 19 October 1954. (Microfilm NL2706)</div>

Despite his lack of prior experience in editing a literary supplement,
Xing Ying took care to develop writers and also became very popular
with readers. Singaporean writer Lin Zhen (林臻) recalled that Xing Ying
reviewed all contributions seriously and fairly – it did not matter if he knew
the author personally, or if the author was not famous. He returned his
edited articles to the writers with comments on how they could improve
their work.[^35] Another Singapore Chinese writer, Xie Ke (谢克), who was
also a prominent local editor in the 1970s and 1980s, recalled the lack of
youth writing platforms in the 1950s: “Without *Wen Feng* and Xing Ying’s
nurturing role, the Chinese literary scene in 1950s Singapore would have been less vibrant, and there would not have been so many youths interested
in literature.”[^36]

Xing Ying created an editorial column – Random Notes (补白杂记),
later renamed *Wen Feng* Mailbox (文风信箱) – to express his views and
communicate with the supplement’s readers, who responded well to it.[^37]
One reader, Mian Ti (缅堤), wrote that this column was “a great inspiration”
and his favourite thing to read in *Wen Feng*.[^38] Xing Ying also used this
column to encourage young writers: “Please write about the issues in life, on matters that are down to earth, with less exaggeration. Write naturally and39
add your personal opinions. With that, you will become a better writer.”[^39]


The editorial column also shows Xing Ying’s commitment to
maintaining *Wen Feng* as a literary platform for writers of all stripes.[^40]
When a reader, Peng Long Fei (彭龙飞), criticised the quality of the poems
published in *Wen Feng*, Xing Ying replied: “*Wen Feng* does not have articles
from professors, famous writers or scholars. Our writers are students
from secondary and primary schools, or even workers or hawkers who are
uneducated, so their works will not be impressive. That said, I do not see a
major problem in the two lines you mentioned.”[^41] After a contributor was
caught for plagiarism, Xing Ying asked readers to forgive the contributor,
who had apologised: “I believe this unfortunate case of plagiarism will not
tarnish the reputation of the literary supplement. Such a thing happened
because of *Wen Feng*’s openness. We should give a second chance to those
who admit their mistakes.”[^42] The column became an intimate space for him
to share his thoughts with readers.

#### **Professionalism and Cosmopolitanism: *Shi Ji Lu* and *Qing Nian Wen Yi***

The later supplements edited by Yao Zi and Xing Ying – *Shi Ji Lu* and *Qing
Nian Wen Yi*, both in *Nanyang Siang Pau* – were more developed, as the
editors were more experienced after editing *Lü Zhou* and *Wen Feng*. Like in
*Lü Zhou*, Yao Zi focused more on literary aesthetics and relied on a small
group of talented writers, while Xing Ying focused on nurturing writers,
accepting many contributions from amateurs.

***Shi Ji Lu: Maintaining Literary Aesthetics in a Literary Supplement***

Yao Zi edited a total of 65 issues of *Shi Ji Lu* from its inception on 8 October
1953, to its end on 16 January 1954.[^43] In that short span, *Shi Ji Lu* became
one of the most influential literary supplements in Singapore, with many contributors becoming well-known writers and editors, for instance Xing
Ying, Zhao Rong, Wei Bei Hua, Xie Ke, Lian Shi Sheng (连士升), Miao Xiu
(苗秀), Wei Yun (韦晕) and Liu Bei An (柳北岸), among others.

The first issue of *Shi Ji Lu* was published four days after the rape
and murder of Zhuang Yu Zhen, the case that sparked the anti-yellow
culture movement (Figure 4). Yao Zi was accused of being a yellow writer
(黄色作家), for his novels such as *Miss Hideko* (秀子姑娘, 1949) and *Ural
Mountains* (乌拉山之夜, 1950) contained descriptions of female body parts
and sex scenes. Some of his poems published in *Shi Ji Lu* hint at the
criticisms he faced. In “A Note to Myself at Age Thirty: A Reply to My
Friends” (三十自题:兼答关怀我的朋友们), he wrote: “Worldly ups and downs
are within my destiny, how can others judge my glory or downfall?”[^44]

<img src="/images/COA%202021/Chinese%20Newspaper%20Literary/Anti_Yellow_Culture.jpg" style="width:80%;">

cameraman shooting a yellow film, and a yellow-film actress fleeing the scene. (Microfilm NL2702)</div>

During this period, Yao Zi was supported by a group of writer friends.
This further cemented his practice of relying on a small group of trusted
writers for the supplement. *Shi Ji Lu*’s three regular contributors were Xing
Ying, Zhao Rong and Miao Xiu, whose articles formed the supplement’s core, in addition to those by Yao Zi himself.[^45] Xing Ying wrote under two
other pen names, Li Qi and Gongsun Zhe (公孙哲). Li Qi’s articles were
about the writing life, such as “A Mature Writer” (成长了的作家) and “Notes
Under the Light” (灯下笔记), while Gongsun Zhe wrote essays criticising
unfairness in society, such as “Fear of Death and Others” (怕死及其他) and
“Along the Road” (在马路旁边). Under the pen name Xing Ying, he wrote
essays on Western literature, for instance “An Occasional Read of Mark
Twain’s Novel” (偶读马克吐温的小说), and an essay on Western philosophy,
“Live, Dead, Eternity (生· 死·永远).[^46] Zhao Rong wrote articles on literary
history under the pen name Zhao Xin, such as “The Direction of Malayan
Chinese Literature and Arts” (马华文艺底路向), and articles on morality
under the pen name Bi Nu (笔奴), such as “Robbery and Morality” (盗与
道) and “To Reprimand the Liars” (斥文骗).[^47] The third regular contributor,
Miao Xiu, wrote literature reviews such as “Lu Xun’s Former Residence
and Zhou Zuoren” (鲁迅的故家与周作人) and “A Discussion on Literary
Criticism” (谈文艺批评) under the pen name Shi Jin (史进).[^48] His novel
*Hanging Red* (挂红) was written under the pen name Miao Yi (苗毅) and
published over several issues of *Shi Ji Lu*.[^49] While Yao Zi’s reliance on a regular group of contributors supplied *Shi Ji Lu* with articles of literary
merit, it resulted in less diversity of writing styles.

As a consequence of the anti-yellow culture movement, the atmosphere
in the literary scene became more conservative. Yet, Yao Zi remained a
creative and experimental editor. Under his editorship, *Shi Ji Lu* ushered
in a new wave of Western literature to the postwar Nanyang literary scene.
Compared to *Lü Zhou*, *Shi Ji Lu* featured more international content. The
inaugural issue included two American short stories in translation – “The
Cop and the Anthem” (警察和赞美诗) by O. Henry and translated by Jiang
Nan Liu (江南柳), and “The Tax Collector” (给收税员) by J. P. McEvoy and
translated by Zhu Ai (主艾) – and an essay on the American writer Jack
London. Other works of Western literature subsequently published in *Shi Ji
Lu* included “L’Aventure” (The Adventure, 艳遇) by the Norwegian writer
Knut Hamsun, translated by Ya Ji (亞玑);[^50] “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow”
(睡谷的传说) by the American writer Washington Irving, translated by
Jiang Nan Liu (江南柳);[^51] “A String of Blue Beads” (一串蓝珠) by the
American writer Charles Fulton Oursler, translated by Xi Bang (希邦);[^52] 
and the poem “Out of the Night That Covers Me” (夜幕笼罩着我) by the
British poet William Ernest Henley, translated by Shou Ming (受明).[^53] *Shi
Ji Lu* occasionally also published translations of biographies of well-known
writers, such as “The Life of O. Henry” (奥·亨利的生平), translated by Jia
Sheng (加生).[^54] 

Yao Zi also published works by Hong Kong writers such as Lü Lun[^55] 
and Liu Yichang (刘以鬯). Liu contributed the short story “Enchanting Building” (迷楼),[^56] and under the pen name Linghu Ling (令狐玲), wrote
reviews of Western literature, including “The Prejudices of Shakespeare”
(莎士比亚的偏见) and “Roger de Coverley’s Style” (罗杰·考浮莱型).[^57]  Yao
Zi further broadened cultural discourse in *Shi Ji Lu* by publishing pieces
on Indonesian music, which was rare for a literary supplement in the
1950s. Articles included “A Forgotten Indonesian Artist: The Composer of
‘Bengawan Solo’, Martohartono” (被遗忘的印尼艺术家: “梭罗河颂”的作者
玛尔多尼亚佐) by Mo Da (莫达), “The Attempt to Collect Indonesian Folk
Songs” (搜集印尼民歌的尝试) by Sun Bin Lin (孙彬琳), and “My Views on
Indonesian Music” (印尼音乐之我见) by Wei Zhi (微知).[^58] 

*Shi Ji Lu* also had a column for young writers called Youth Square
(青年广场). The article “Eradicating the Perverts” (扫荡色情狂), written
by Bai Xu (白絮), a student from Nanyang Girls’ High School, advocated
the eradication of yellow culture in Singapore.[^59] Another contributor, Bin
Bing (斌冰), discussed “The Future after Graduation” (毕业后的出路问题),[^60] 
while in “Preferential Treatment for Some Students” (优待学生), Huang Yi
(黄裔) wrote that a movie company gave free tickets for American movies to
students in English-medium schools, but not to students in Chinese schools.
In contrast to Xing Ying, whose replies emphasised values and morals,
Yao Zi replied sarcastically that Huang’s anger seemed misplaced: it suited
English-school students to watch substandard American movies.[^61] Despite
their different editorial philosophies, both editors promoted social justice for
students in their own way.

***Qing Nian Wen Yi: Nurturing Writers and Promoting Multiculturalism***


In July 1960, Xing Ying became editor of *Qing Nian Wen Yi* in *Nanyang
Siang Pau*, which became one of the longest-running literary supplements
of the 1960s, when some newspapers
supplements did not last even a month.[^62]
It ran for 729 issues over nearly six and a
half years, from 20 July 1960 to 6 February
1967.[^63] *Qing Nian Wen Yi* was the last literary
supplement edited by Xing Ying, and with
his death, the supplement ended too. The
tagline in *Qing Nian Wen Yi*’s title plate
(Figure 5) was a clear statement of its mission:
“Published every Wednesday, a writing
platform for the youth”.

Wen Yi</i> taken from the inaugural issue, 20 July 1960, 14. (Microfilm NL2758)</div>

*Qing Nian Wen Yi* published poems,
essays and literature reviews by students.
Compared to Xing Ying’s prior literary
supplements, *Wen Feng* and *Xin Miao*, *Qing
Nian Wen Yi* featured more articles on world
literature; in this sense, it was more similar
to Yao Zi’s *Lü Zhou* and *Shi Ji Lu*. Notable
Western works appeared in translation, such
as the essay “On National Prejudices” (爱国的偏见) by the Irish writer
Oliver Goldsmith, and Mark Twain’s essay on writing technique, “How I
Start Writing Essays” (我怎样开始写文章).[^64]

This international perspective was partly due to Xing Ying’s love for
foreign literature and exposure to Japan as a teenager. It can also be seen as
a move to introduce world literature to young readers. Some of Xing Ying’s
favourite foreign writers were Bernard Shaw, Anton Chekhov, Alexander
Pushkin, Friedrich Schiller, William Somerset Maugham, Romain Rolland, Leo Tolstoy and Mark Twain. In 1960, Xing Ying was invited by Radio
Singapore to give a series of 10 lectures on Japanese culture.[^65]

Besides foreign literature, *Qing Nian Wen Yi* published writings related
to international affairs. For instance, in the issue of 8 March 1961, the
supplement ran a special column of student poems dedicated to Congo,
in commemoration of the innocent lives lost during the ongoing Congo
Crisis.[^66] Compared to *Wen Feng*, which focused on literary news, *Qing Nian
Wen Yi* offered broader world news coverage.

*Qing Nian Wen Yi* also published translated articles on Malay literature,
including M. Zain Salleh’s “The Mission of Literature during Nation
Building” (建设时期的文学的任务), and an essay titled “An Outstanding
Malay Poet: Tongkat Warrant” (东革·华兰: 杰出的马来诗人), introducing
the poet who was better known by his pen name, Osman Awang.[^67] There
were also original writings in Chinese on Malay literature, including an
essay by Bi Cheng (碧澄), who praised Ishak Haji Muhammad for his
persevering attitude towards writing (依萨哈芝穆哈末: 一位勤于写作的
马来作家).[^68] Such articles show that Chinese readers then were interested
in Malay literature.

#### **The Need for an Additional Supplement: Zhou Mo Qing Nian and Xin Miao**
The literary supplements edited by Yao Zi and Xing Ying were so popular
with readers and contributors that new literary supplements – *Zhou Mo
Qing Nian* in *Nanfang Evening Post*, and *Xin Miao* with *Qing Nian Wen Yi* in *Nanyang Siang Pau* – were created to accommodate the increasing
number of contributions from young writers. While both editors were
concerned about the youth of Singapore, Yao Zi focused more on the
social problems that students faced, while Xing Ying offered the students
writing advice.

***Zhou Mo Qing Nian and Youth Square***


Yao Zi was the editor of the weekly literary supplement *Zhou Mo Qing
Nian*, producing eight issues during his tenure from 1 November 1952
to 27 December 1952. He created *Zhou Mo Qing Nian* in response to
aspiring young writers who could not get published in* Lü Zhou*. In an
editorial, Yao Zi wrote that the articles in *Zhou Mo Qing Nian* might not
be “up to standard”, but they focused more on content and less on writing
technique.[^69]

While *Lü Zhou* was more literary, *Zhou Mo Qing Nian* was targeted at
the youth.[^70] The articles dealt with issues that concerned this demographic,
such as education and social justice. Writings on observations about
society included “Rubber Tappers” (割胶的工人) by Lin Jian (林建) and
“Unemployment” (失业) by Yuan Yuan (媛媛).[^71] Other articles gave tips and
encouragement to young writers who wanted to have their works published
in newspapers, such as “How to Practise Writing” (怎样练习稿子) by Bu
Dong Shi (不懂事),[^72] and “My Experience with Manuscript Rejection” (投稿
失败给我的经验) by Qin Kai (秦凯).[^73]

As he would later do in *Shi Ji Lu* as well, Yao Zi created a column in
*Zhou Mo Qing Nian* called Youth Square (青年广场), to allow students to
give voice to injustices they suffered or observed (Figure 6). Yao Zi made
it clear that the column was not a place to vent one’s personal anger; its
purpose was to improve Chinese education in Malaya, by providing a forum
for those treated unjustly to speak up, so that the school authorities could not turn a blind eye to abuses of power.[^74] In one case, a student had to
put his studies on hold for a semester, but the school continued to charge
tuition fees;[^75] in another case, a principal was called out for being partial
in his selection of articles to be published in the school journal.[^76] The issues might seem immature and trivial, but they were serious matters for the
supplement’s young readership. Hence, *Zhou Mo Qing Nian* was more than
a literary supplement for the youth; it was a publication that concerned itself
with youth welfare.

Besides Youth Square, *Zhou Mo Qing Nian* had another regular feature:
a poetry column that showcased about five to seven poems by young writers
in each issue. This demonstrates that Yao Zi was keen to encourage poetry
writing among the youth, despite his overall emphasis on literary aesthetics.
The poems tended to revolve around youthful aspirations and experiences,
such as “Hope” (期待) by Xue Zi (学子), “If” (假使) by Wang Shao Quan
(王绍全), “Awaking from a Dream” (梦醒) by Fa Yuan (发源), “Forced to
Move” (迫迁) by Li Yin (李音), and “Laughter by the Seashore” (海滨的
笑声) by Xiao Ling (小绫).[^77]

***Xin Miao: Music Meets Literature***


Xing Ying was the editor of *Xin Miao*, the “brother supplement” of *Wen
Feng*. The publication of these two literary supplements in *Nanyang Siang
Pau* overlapped by six months, from March to August 1958, which was also
the lifespan of *Xin Miao*. *Xin Miao* did not have a fixed publication schedule
– it was initially published thrice a week, but the frequency later dropped to
once a week. Like Random Notes in *Wen Feng*, *Xin Miao* Mailbox served as
a forum for readers and Xing Ying to communicate with one another.[^78]

In creating *Xin Miao*, Xing Ying hoped to give secondary school
students a platform to publish their writings. Ever the nurturer of writers,
he wrote in his first editorial: “If you keep writing, the article gets better.
If you keep using the pen, it gets sharper.”[^79] Singaporean writer Liu Shun
(柳舜), who used to contribute to *Xin Miao*, recalled that Xing Ying was
approachable and kind to younger writers, and listened to their concerns.[^80]

*Xin Miao* published fiction, poems, essays, playscripts, illustrations and
woodblock prints. Similar to *Zhou Mo Qing Nian*, the topics and themes
were relevant to the lives of younger readers, with articles like “My First Overseas Trip” (我的第一次旅行) by Yang Zhi (杨之).[^81] The issue on 15
March 1958 (Figure 7), for example, included contributions such as “The
First Test” (第一次测验), “Mango” (芒果), “Rabbit, Wolf, Elephant, Fox”
(兔子·狼·大象·狐狸) and “In the Rubber Plantation” (在胶林里).[^82] Writings
on local conditions were also popular, such as “Life in the Lower-income
Class in Singapore and Malaya” (新马的一部分底层生活) by Xue Li Si
(学裏思), “To the Wet Market” (上巴刹) by Xiao Yun (小韵), “My Village”
(我的乡村) by Zhu Ying (竹影), “A Fire in Geylang” (芽笼的火灾) by Hong
Xing (红星), and “Queenstown” (女皇镇), a poem by Gao Bang (高邦).[^83]

*Xin Miao* was also a platform for music education and appreciation,
with several of the issues featuring musical scores and music-related writing.
*Xin Miao* published four scores, all composed by Huang Hun (黄昏), with
lyrics by Hu Yang (湖洋): “Lullaby” (摇篮曲), “Midnight” (子夜), “A Nursery
Rhyme My Mother Taught Me” (母亲教我一首儿歌) and “Idyllic Fields”
(田园芳草) (Figure 7).[^84] Articles with musical themes included “Learning
Music with Friends” (与友人学音乐) by Gao Xiu (高秀), “Music and Life”
(音乐与人生) by Yu Si Yi (余思毅), and “My View on ‘Running Donkey’:
Chinese Folk Dance” (我看《跑驴》:中国民间舞蹈) and “The New School
Song” (新校舍歌) by Shan Ba Zi (山芭子).[^85]

<img src="/images/COA%202021/Chinese%20Newspaper%20Literary/Xin_Miao.jpg" style="width:80%;">
<div style="background-color: white;"><i>Xin Miao</i> published music scores (middle) and satirical comics (left) alongside the usual
literary contributions. The scores were presented in Chinese-style numerical notation, rather than
Western-style notation. 15 March 1958, 19. (Microfilm NL2736)</div>

#### **Conclusion**
Both* Nanyang Siang Pau* and *Nanfang Evening Post* had significant
readerships, which contributed to the influence of their literary supplements.
As an editor, Yao Zi focused more on literary aesthetics, relying on a group
of regular contributors, while Xing Ying focused more on developing
writers and engaging readers. However, in *Zhou Mo Qing Nian*, Yao Zi, too,
accepted amateur works from young writers.

Given their positions of influence, Yao Zi and Xing Ying played an
important role in promoting local literature and writers, many of whom
later became established figures in the Chinese literary scene. In addition,
both editors brought world literature and new ideas to local readers,
including Western writing techniques, translations of foreign classics,
and international literary news. They also promoted multiculturalism
by publishing translations of Malay literary works and original essays
in Chinese discussing Malay literature. Vibrant, cross-cultural and
multilingual, the literary scene in the 1950s and 1960s is an area that
deserves further study.
