---
<p>Hedwig Anuar was the first Malayan to head the National Library, a position
she held for 23 years until 1988. She was also involved in the setting
up the Singapore Book Council, National Archives of Singapore and Association
of Women for Action and Research. Her daughter, Shirin Aroozoo, tells us
about Anuar as a mother and a person, and about how her convictions about
books, children's education and women empowerment were shaped by her upbringing
and life events.</p>
