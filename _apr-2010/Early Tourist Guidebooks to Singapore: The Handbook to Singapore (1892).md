#### The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 along with advances in steamships, saw a boom in travellers visiting the East. Senior Librarian _Bonny Tan_ explores travel guides for visitors seeking a leisurely but safe journey to the mystical but demystified Far East.

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*“No part of the world is now to be sacred from the intrusive foot of the tourist*<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*and where the traveler goes, guide-books will ultimately follow….”*<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;G. M. Reith, Padre in partibus, p. 1.

Travellers from Europe saw their journey to the East cut down by as much as half when the Suez Canal opened in 1869. Steamships, helped along with advances in their engine development, were preferred over sailing ships as they proved faster and more efficient. Beginning as mail services dispatching post, ships from companies like the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company soon became vessels for ferrying passengers. In turn, travelogues written by the adventurous sojourner who happened to be sailor, civil servant or missionary soon evolved into travel guides published by travel companies for the paying tourist seeking a leisurely but safe journey to the mystical but demystified Far East.

#### **A Useful Vade-Mecum**

At a time when guidebooks for the Western hemisphere were being churned out by such publishers as Murray and Badaeker, Rev. George Murray Reith, resident minister of the local Presbyterian Church, took it upon himself to write a handy guide to Singapore for visitors to the town.

 &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*“It is intended to supply a felt want in Singapore; to give in a <br> handy form some notes historical, descriptive, scientific, &c, <br> in regard to the town and island; to afford what information is necessary <br> to guide visitors during their stay, and to obviate some <br> of the difficulties which travelers always encounter in a strange  <br>place.”* (Reith, 1892, p. iii).
