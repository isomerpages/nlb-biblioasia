Loke Wan Tho (1915–64) was a man with wide interests; he was a film magnate, a support of local sports, a photographer and an ornithologist. His niece, Choo Meileen, chairwoman of Cathay Organisation, called him a renaissance man.[^1]

<h4>A Pioneer in Local Film Production </h4>
 In 1953, Loke Wan Tho set up Cathay-Keris with Ho Ah Loke, expanding the Cathay film distribution business into film production. Cathay-Keris was Singapore’s second film studio and was a competitor to Shaw’s Malay Film Productions. These were the only two film studios in Singapore for the next 20 years, which was known as the golden age of the studios.[^2]

Cathay-Keris focused on Malay films, as Malaya had a fast-expanding film market. In 1951, the Cathay’s International Associated Theatres generated twice as much revenue from Malaya compared to Singapore.[^3]
