#### The grandeur and opulence of Eu Villa on Mount Sophia was unrivalled in its heyday.
By Patricia Lin

Eu Villa, the home of Eu Tong Sen (1877–1941), was perhaps the most spectacular mansion to be built in Singapore in the early years of the 20th century that was owned by a Straits Chinese. Nicknamed “the King of Tin”, Eu was also the man behind traditional Chinese medicine retailer Eu Yan Sang.

Eu was born in Penang on 23 July 1877 but received his early education in Foshan, China. His father Eu Kong, who left his hometown of Foshan for Penang in 1873, was a self-made millionaire. The elder Eu had the foresight to later venture into business in the then remote town of Gopeng in the Kampar district of Perak.[^1]&nbsp;

He took over his father’s business at the relative early age of 21 following the latter’s untimely death in 1890. He parlayed his father’s concerns into mining, rubber, banking, traditional Chinese medicine, entertainment and hotels. Like many of the Chinese entrepreneurs of his time, Eu’s wealth was also accrued through the acquisition of British monopolies for opium, alcohol and gambling.[^2]&nbsp;

**An Opulent Mansion**

Eu Villa on Adis Road was the third mansion to be built at the site on Mount Sophia. The first home belonged to Municipal Engineer W.T. Carrington, who had purchased the two-acre property from merchant Charles Robert Prinsep and built Carrington House sometime around 1873 (by 1840, Prinsep had established a huge nutmeg and coffee plantation on the hill and in the surrounding areas). Little is known as to who owned the property following Carington’s death in 1878.[^3]

In 1903, the house was purchased by Nissim N. Adis, the Calcutta barrister and businessman. Adis demolished the Carrington edifice and built a luxurious mansion that came to be known as Adis Lodge. It had a steel and concrete construction, and a commanding view of Singapore.&nbsp; The mansion had eight bedrooms and boasted a bathroom for each bedroom, with hot and cold running water.[^4]

The Adis family occupied their lodge for less than 10 years before the property was purchased by Eu Tong Sen. Evidently unimpressed by the elegance and opulence of Adis Lodge, he proceeded to demolish the building and built the villa that would be unrivaled for decades.[^5] Eu Villa would be only one of a string of luxurious mansions that he commissioned to be built in Singapore, Hong Kong (where he had two palatial homes), Gopeng and Kuala Lumpur.[^6] Rumour has it that Eu had been told by a seer that he had to keep building if he wished to live a long life, and build he did.

Eu Villa, which commanded a panoramic view of the town and harbour, was designed by the architectural firm of Swan &amp; Maclaren for a million dollars and completed in 1913. “Eu Villa has the mark of a millionaire in all its commodious premises. It is built like a chateau – the French influence is strong – and its dull-white exterior shines like a pearl under the burning tropical sun” reported the _Straits Times_ in 1934.[^7]
