#### The mere mention of the Malay Archipelago conjures up images of amazing rare things and nature’s paradise. During the 17th century, the term “natural history illustration” came into use as artists created images of plants and animals for documentation and study. Early Europeans who had studied the flora and fauna of the region include Stamford Raffles, William Farquhar, William Marsden and Alfred Russel Wallace.

To the early naturalist, the mere mention of Malay Archipelago conjures up images of amazing rare things and nature’s paradise. Interest in natural history in this region corresponded with the energetic intellectual climate in early modern Europe. During the 17th century, the term *natural history illustration* came into use as artists created
images of plants and animals for documentation and study. Many European ships set sail for journeys of discovery
during that period. The travelling naturalists responded to the flora and fauna and to the landscapes, in which they worked.

Rendering the nature’s elegance and beauty has a long history. Dating as early as 30,000 years ago, the oldest "scientific” records can be seen from the French caves.
Pictures of ancient Egyptians sacrifice and Leonardo da Vinci’s sketches of human bodies are notable forms of early scientific drawing. There are also vivid descriptions of
exotic flowers in the South East Asia including the Rafflesia arnoldi, the world’s largest flower and the Orchideous plant,
discovered by Sir Stamford Raffles.
