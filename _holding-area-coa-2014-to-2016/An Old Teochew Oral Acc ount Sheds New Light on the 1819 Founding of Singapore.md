#### **Introduction: The Chinese in Singapore Before Raffles**

The landing of Sir Stamford Raffles at the Singapore River on 28 January
1819 is often seen as the turning point of Singapore’s history, marking
its modern era. To no small extent, this has been influenced by the
Englishman’s writings back home, which included his famous declarations
to the Duchess of Somerset of Singapore as “my new colony” and “a child
of my own and I have made it what it is”.1 Other luminary patrons were
briefed that the settlement’s original population “scarcely amounted to 200”
before it surged to “not less than 3,000” in three months, and that in over a
year, the “insignificant fishing village” had been transformed into a “port…
surrounded by an extensive town” with “ten or twelve thousand souls,
principally Chinese”.2

These testimonies invariably aggrandised Raffles’ personal role in the founding
of Singapore. However, a recently published private correspondence dated
8 January 1819 between Raffles and East India Company (EIC) Governor
General Lord Hastings, reveals his possession, at least nine days before sailing
from Penang to Singapore, of intelligence that his intended destination
already had “about 2,000 inhabitants upon it (new settlers) under a respectable
Chief” [text in parentheses in original].3 Conspicuously, all his known
communication to England excluded this information; for instance, Raffles
had later told Hastings that “when the British flag was first hoisted, there were
not perhaps fifty-three Chinese on the island”.4

Within two days of his arrival, Raffles had the written agreement of the
local ruler, Temenggong Abdul Rahman, to set up an EI C trading factory.
This was formalised by a treaty with the former Johor Sultanate crown
prince Tengku Long (whom he assented to recognise as Sultan Hussein
Shah) and the Temenggong on 6 February 1819.5 Exactly a week later, Raffles
prepared an official report to the EIC Supreme Government in Calcutta that
contained, among other insights, a full description of ongoing economic
activities in Singapore. In his own words:
