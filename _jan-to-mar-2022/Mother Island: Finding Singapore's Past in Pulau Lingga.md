####  Singapore’s history is closely intertwined with that of Lingga’s. The kings that once reigned from its shores played a pivotal role in the fate of the Malay world, including the birth of modern Singapore, as **Faris Joraimi** reveals.

In a half-forgotten corner of Telok Belanga (officially rendered as Telok Blangah), sandwiched between Bukit Purmei and Kampong Bahru Road, lies the tomb of the last king of the Riau-Lingga Sultanate, Sultan Abdul Rahman Mua’zzam Shah II (r. 1883–1911). Deposed by the Dutch in 1911 after refusing to sign a treaty that would effectively strip him of all power, he fled to Singapore where he lived in exile until his death in 1930.

Today, many Singaporeans associate the Riau islands, now part of Indonesia,
with Batam’s massage parlours and Bintan’s more sanitised resorts. Fewer,
though, have any inkling of just how much Singapore is bound to this archipelago by ties of history, economics and culture. Who remembers, for instance, that both Singapore and the Riau-Lingga archipelago were once part of the same maritime empire: the old Sultanate of Johor that emerged after the fall of Melaka to the Portuguese in 1511? Modern Singapore came into being ultimately with the dismemberment of this realm in 1824, when the Anglo-Dutch Treaty divided the Malay World between the British and the Dutch.[^1]

<b>SPY MUSIC</b>
<br><br>
The music[^2] for <i>Five Ashore in Singapore</i> was composed by renowned French composer Antoine Duhamel, who had just begun his career by scoring French New Wave films by legendary directors Jean-Luc Godard and François Truffaut. At the request of <i>Five Ashore</i>’s director Bernard Toublanc-Michel, he composed <i>Somewhere in Singapore</i> (also known as the Marines’ March – “La marche des Marines” in French) with lyrics by Jimmy Parramore.

<br><br>
Quite brazenly, the song was directly based on the melody of the now iconic <i>[Yellow Submarine](https://google.com)</i>, the Beatles’ number one hit in 1966. Indeed, Toublanc-Michel had asked his actors who played the five Marines to stride out of Clifford Pier with the Beatles’ song playing in their heads, so as to lend a certain rhythm to their swagger.
<br><br>
Other melodies with no lyrics composed by Duhamel include <i>Paradise Limited</i> for the club scene and <i>Thème de la drogue</i> (the drug theme) for the opium den scene. </span>
