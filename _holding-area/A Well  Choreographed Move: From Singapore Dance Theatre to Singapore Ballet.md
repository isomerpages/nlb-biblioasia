One of Singapore’s oldest professional dance companies has become one of its newest. On 10 December 2021, Singapore Dance Theatre (SDT) announced that a little over 30 years after it was first unveiled to the public, it was jettisoning its old name and embracing a new one – Singapore Ballet.

The new name is perhaps the most potent symbol of how much the company has changed and grown since its public debut at the Singapore Festival of the Arts in 1988. At the time, the company was unknown; it had just seven dancers and its future looked uncertain. Today, the company has grown to 35 dancers and apprentices of various nationalities, with a loyal following locally and an international profile as well. Janek Schergen, its artistic director, receives applications from aspiring dancers daily.1

The company has made a name for itself in numerous festivals and events such as Le Temps d’Aimer la Danse in Biarritz, France; Mexico’s Festival Internacional Cervantino; Chang Mu Arts Festival in Korea; and the Philippines Festival of Dance. 

#### **From the Get-Goh**

While many individuals have played an important role in the company’s journey, no retelling of its history would be complete without considering the contributions of the Goh siblings – Goh Soo Nee (also went by Goh Soonee and Soonee Goh), Goh Soo Khim and Goh Choo San. The three siblings played vital roles, though in very different ways: Soo Nee prepared the ground by starting an important predecessor institution to SDT; Soo Khim, on the other hand, led the company during its fledgling years; and although Choo San died prematurely, he was, and continues to be, spiritually influential, as can be seen by the fact that the company continues to restage his ballets, even till today.

Although the company was founded in the late 1980s, the seeds of the company were planted four decades earlier when Soo Nee followed her ballet teacher to Australia to train at the Francis Scully Ballet School, before moving to London where she auditioned for the highly competitive Royal Ballet School. In her oral history interview with the Oral History Centre, she recalled strongly the exhilaration then. “It was very exciting for me because the training is very intensive,” she said, “and I like[d] it very much.”2

When Soo Nee returned to Singapore in 1958, she founded the Singapore Ballet Academy (SBA) with local dance aficionados Vernon Martinez and Frances Poh. It soon became the home for Singapore’s aspiring dancers, including Soo Nee's younger siblings.

The SBA soon gained a reputation as an excellent dance school, but its dancers faced a dilemma: as Singapore did not have a local professional dance company, any student who developed a deeper interest in dance had to go abroad for further studies or to pursue a career in dance, as Soo Nee herself had done.
