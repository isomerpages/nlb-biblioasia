Founded in 1820 by Arab philanthropist Syed Omar Ali Aljunied, Masjid Omar Kampong Melaka is Singapore’s oldest mosque. The book traces Syed Omar’s travels from Yemen to Palembang and finally to Singapore, where he built a *surau* (prayer hall). Sharing their stories in this book are the community of Muslims, the founder’s family, Singapore’s leaders and town planners, and heritage buffs.
