#### **Introduction**
It did not take long for the London Missionary Society (LMS ) to arrive in
Singapore after Stamford Raffles of the British East India Company signed
a treaty with Sultan Hussein Mahmud Shah on 6 February 1819 to establish
a trading post on the island. The first missionary arrived a few months later,
on 18 October 1819. Samuel Milton set up a mission house on Bras Basah
Road and was subsequently joined in 1822 by Claudius Henry Thomsen,
who had transferred from the mission in Malacca.

Raffles had already had contact with the LMS missionaries in Malacca,
describing Reverend William Milne as “a liberal, well-informed, excellent
man”.[^1] He thought less of several other missionaries he had met there and,
presumably questioning their effectiveness, wrote, “Had I been a Missionary
myself I think I could have evangelised the whole island by this time”.[^2]  He
was nonetheless interested in their printing presses, seeing the potential of
the presses for secular use. He engaged the LMS missionaries in Singapore
to print his first proclamations – 50 copies in English and 50 copies in
Malay. Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir, who had been Raffles’ Malay teacher, secretary and interpreter, was now working with the missionaries and
described the laborious process and the pressure they were under:

   *For two days I sat making types… At last at three o’clock in the<br> 
   morning all was finished, for the same morning, which was the<br> 
   first day of the new year, they wanted to publish the laws. Work<br> 
   went on and on and the perspiration poured off us. Eyes drooped<br> 
   and stomachs felt the pangs of hunger, all because the task had to<br> 
   be finished that night. For Mr. Raffles had insisted that it be ready<br> 
   by the next morning. And the next morning the notices were posted<br> 
   in every quarter of the town*.[^3]

By February 1823, Thomsen had written to London noting that “we are now
printing in English &amp; Malay &amp; have a small Type-Foundery &amp; are doing
bookbinding. Government has been pleased to honour our little Press…
with printing all public Documents both in English and Malay”.[^4]

In this early entanglement of Empire and religion, I would like to explore
the motivations of these missionary printers, the challenges they faced and
their contributions to early printing in Singapore. What brought them from
Britain to the other side of the world? And what did they achieve?

#### **On a Mission**
The last years of the 18th century saw a surge of evangelical Protestant
revival in Britain. This was triggered by a range of complex social and
economic changes, which included the rise of a comfortable middle class
with money to spend on charity and good works; an aspiring working
class with a desire for self-improvement through adult education; and the
expansion of commerce and influence abroad, largely through the growing
markets of the British East India Company.

The successful expeditions of Captain James Cook to the Pacific added to
this sense of economic expansion at home and abroad, and, for Christian
evangelists, an optimism about the possibilities of spreading the gospel to far-flung lands – particularly urgent for those who believed in a forthcoming
millennium when Christ would return to earth and all would be judged.
Several missionary societies, set up to send forth Christian missionaries,
were formed within a few years of one another – the Baptist Missionary
Society in 1792, the London Missionary Society in 1795, the Church
Missionary Society in 1799 and the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society
in 1813.[^5]

The public meeting held in September 1795 to formally establish the LMS
attracted such fanfare that many people started arriving an hour before the
appointed time, and thousands more had to be turned away.[^6] Most were
from non-conformist or dissenting churches, believing in a simple style
of worship based on the scriptures. They had come to hear about plans to
spread Christianity “among heathen and other unenlightened nations”.[^7]

It is easy to read these words today as evidence of a sense of racial
or cultural superiority. Yet we need to understand them through the
evangelical prism of the time, bound up with the belief of salvation – that
is, only those who believed in Christ could be “saved” and go to Heaven.
Thus the duty of the evangelical Christian was to spread the gospel widely
across nations, so that as many souls as possible might be saved. As one
preacher put it, “Ye were once pagans, living in cruel and abominable
idolatry. The servants of Jesus came from other lands… And ought you
not… to send messengers to the nations which are in like conditions to
yourselves of old”.[^8]

Another preached that:

   *Possessing, as they do, the same feelings of nature as ourselves,<br> 
   the same moral wants, the same faculties of improvement, the<br> 
   same dread of misery, the same desire of happiness, and the same<br> 
   capacity of enjoyment, ought we not zealously to endeavour that<br> 
   they may also become partakers of like precious faith with us, and<br> 
   sharers in the same common salvation*.[^9]

While some individuals might have felt themselves racially superior, the
evangelical doctrine was egalitarian in the belief that the gospel could save
*all* who embraced it. Brian Stanley has argued that:

   *For most of the nineteenth century, if the missionary movement can<br> 
   be accused of racism, the racism was of a “soft” kind. It was based,<br> 
   not on any notion of permanent biological inequality between<br> 
   races, but on obstinately deep-rooted convictions about differences<br> 
   between “civilized” and “uncivilized” peoples, which were<br> 
   explained in terms of a causal connection between Christianity<br> 
   and the regenerative process of “civilization”*.[^10]
	 
Translating scripture into local languages was considered crucial and for this
they needed printing presses and people skilled enough to operate them.
Volunteers came forward and the first mission was despatched in late 1796
to Tahiti. Although this was not a success,[^11] further missions were sent to
Africa and the West Indies, with China – and its huge population – viewed
as the big prize.

A mission to China had been considered at the very first meeting of the
Society. Trade with China was burgeoning during this period, with tea
in high demand. In London, shops were selling Chinese silk, porcelain,
lacquerware and furniture, yet it was an ambivalent relationship: David
Porter has suggested that the 18th-century consumer was infatuated with
Chinese and Chinese-styled goods, “even as they were amused, perplexed, or troubled by the alien aesthetic sensibility these goods embodied”, finding
these Chinese objects and aesthetic ideas “at once alluring and repulsive,
charming and grotesque, strange and strangely familiar”.[^12]

This was also a time when Britain made new efforts to make official
diplomatic connections with China – Lord Macartney had undertaken
his embassy to the imperial court in China from 1793 to 1794.[^13] The
Emperor’s rejection of his gifts and requests to permanently station a British
ambassador in Peking, and thus open up Chinese ports to British trade,
reinforced views of the differences between East and West. It also meant,
as Ross Forman has argued, that China was “one place where Britain was
forced to recognise… the agency of a people and culture that they were
actively trying to control, classify, or otherwise contain”.[^14]

The LMS founders were keen to get to China to preach the gospel but,
besides the practicalities of getting missionaries there, it was difficult to
find dictionaries or teachers of Chinese languages. William Milne, who
would eventually be sent to China and then Malacca, wrote that “there were
no helps in English, to assist in the acquisition of the Chinese language –
England knew, and cared little about China, beyond its commerce”.[^15]

Nonetheless, their first missionary to China, Robert Morrison, arrived in
1807, but the imperial restrictions on foreigners meant that he was limited
to Canton (now Guangzhou) in the trading season and to Macao at other
times. It was forbidden to teach Chinese languages to foreigners and by the
time the second missionary, William Milne, arrived in 1813, an imperial
edict had made it a capital offence to publish Christian texts in Chinese.
Clear that the mission could not expand beyond Morrison’s presence,
a decision was made for Milne to explore other locations in the region, where a base could be established while waiting for China to open up to
foreign missions.

Malacca was chosen because it had a sizeable Chinese population and
was along a busy trade route. Milne relocated there, together with printer
Liang A-Fa, and was joined shortly after by Claudius Henry Thomsen,
who concentrated on Malay, and his language tutor, Abdullah bin
Abdul Kadir. This was a more successful enterprise: they established
small schools, procured land for what was to become the Anglo-Chinese
College and, by the end of 1820, had produced some 140,000 books and
periodicals in Chinese, and over 20,000 items in Malay.[^16] In 1819, bases
were also established in Penang, Singapore and Batavia (now Jakarta) –
together with Malacca and their small China presence, they formed the
Ultra-Ganges Mission.

The Singapore mission started well. Milton concentrated on translations
into the Chinese and Siamese languages, while Thomsen focused on the
Malay and Bugis languages. They were sufficiently well-regarded that Raffles
was keen for the Society’s successful Anglo-Chinese College in Malacca to
move to Singapore as part of his planned Singapore Institution, with the
missionaries taking key teaching roles. Despite the laying of the foundation
stone in 1823, the transfer of the College did not materialise. Nonetheless,
the arrival of more printing presses in 1822 enabled Milton and Thomsen to
begin printing the evangelical texts that they had been translating, as well
as undertake printing for commercial firms and the government as a way
of earning income for the mission. In this way, Mission Press became the
printer for Singapore’s first newspaper, the *Singapore Chronicle*, from 1824
to 1830.[^17]

The missionaries handed out their Christian tracts during rounds of house
visits in the town and the interior of the island, with “each perambulation
taking up to 6 to 8 weeks and renewed at uncertain intervals of 3 or 4
months”.[^18] The tracts were also distributed on ships in the harbour, partly in the hope that some would ultimately reach China. The 1830 report of
the Singapore Christian Union (composed mainly of the LMS missionaries
and the Anglican chaplain) described how they distributed 60 Bibles, 200
testaments and 4,000 tracts on board junks and small boats.[^19]

There were ups and downs. Printing work in Singapore was disrupted for
some years when an LMS delegation “discharged” Milton in 1825 – he had
gotten carried away with grandiose schemes, offended the Resident, and his
colleagues in Malacca thought him “insane” – leaving the mission without
a Chinese focus for a period of more than 10 years. Another LMS delegation
visited the next year and this time concluded that Thomsen was someone
“destitute of missionary talent”, who had concentrated on his own commercial
interests, leading to “the most complete inactivity as to all missionary duties”.[^20]
He was included in a list of “troublemakers” for the Society, described as
“perpetual blisters” that the Society “seem(ed) destined to carry”.[^21]

The LMS directors in London resolved at this point to abandon a permanent
mission in Singapore, but subsequently rescinded the decision. Thomsen
remained and produced some key works during this period, including a
Malay translation of the *Sermon on the Mount* and the *English-Malay-Bugis
Vocabulary*. Nonetheless, he left in 1834 after some seemingly unfounded
rumours that he had taken up with local women. He maintained that he
owned the presses and some of the land, and sold them to the American
Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM), controversially
leaving the LMS without an effective printing set-up.[^22] The mission was
largely vacant until January 1838, except for two short periods of occupation
by Samuel Wolfe.[^23]

The ABCFM ran the press until 1843, doing some printing for the LMS ,
particularly after the arrival of further, more capable members of the LMS
mission: the Stronach brothers in 1838; Benjamin Keasberry in 1839 (to
whom they loaned a press); and Samuel Dyer, who transferred from Malacca
in 1842. When China at last “opened up” to foreigners after the First Opium
War, the Board closed its mission in Singapore and the press and land were
given back to the LMS . The “wait for China” was over.

By 1847, the LMS had also formally closed its mission in Singapore.
Keasberry elected to remain and continue his work, with some limited
assistance from the London headquarters, running a successful school for
Malay boys, preaching in his Malay chapel and continuing translating
and printing. He died in 1875 and the presses were sold commercially, thus
ending any lingering LMS presence in Singapore.

There are some physical reminders in Singapore today of the LMS presence:
Prinsep Street Presbyterian Church (where Keasberry had his Malay Chapel,
now a National Monument); Glory Presbyterian Church, formerly the Bukit
Timah church established by Keasberry; St Margaret’s School, which had its
beginnings in Maria Dyer’s school for Chinese girls; and Zion Road, named
for Keasberry’s Mount Zion mission station. To consider the intangible
impacts of their time in Singapore and the region, it is useful to first look at
the practical challenges they faced and how they approached their mission,
before assessing their legacy.

#### **Celebrity and Reality**
By the 1840s, LMS meetings in London were still attracting large crowds of
supporters, sometimes up to 4,000 to 5,000.[^24] Susan Thorne has described
the May missionary meetings as “a signal event in the Congregational social
calendar, equivalent perhaps to the London season itself”.[^25] Such public
missionary meetings, held annually or biannually throughout Britain, heard
reports from the foreign missions and were often addressed by missionaries
themselves, who had completed their mission or returned on leave.

Thorne notes that they returned “as conquering heroes of an unchartered
heathen wilderness and were greeted by receptions not unlike those that would be accorded the military heroes and monarchs later in the century”.[^26] 
David Livingstone famously returned from Africa in 1856 to a celebrity
reception, but missionaries such as Robert Morrison also undertook the
lecture circuit. Morrison was even presented to the King in 1824, with
Morrison giving the monarch a copy of his Chinese translation of the Bible
and a map of Peking.[^27]

This emphasis on the heroic missionary overcoming trials in faraway
lands has been described as “muscular Christianity”, a term first coined in
1857 to describe the ideal male missionary attributes of Christian virtue,
physical prowess and morality.[^28] As Anna Johnston has noted, “muscular
Christianity… [provided] a masculine complement to the evangelical
view of women’s innate piety: it provided men with equal opportunity
for religious sanctity”.[^29] The LMS had initially only recruited single men.
Emily Mantekelow has suggested that this was for a range of reasons:
“pre-embarkation marriage was extremely costly; including women in a
potentially dangerous enterprise threatened the propriety of a respectable
institution; and women and families were burdensome, requiring expensive
and inconvenient material and physical concessions… while at the same
time potentially distracting male missionaries from their spiritual work”.[^30]

There were also concerns about their financial support if they were
widowed, or their children orphaned. Far better to send out single men
who could potentially marry local converts. Soon, though, it was resolved
that married men and their wives would be accepted, as the presence of
women and children at the mission could act as a model of Christian
domesticity, provide a means of outreach to local women and act as a
counter to the temptations of illicit sexual liaisons.[^31] As Silvester Horne, in
his history of the LMS , wrote, “the spectacle of a true Christian home [is]

appreciation by the common people”.[^32]

It was understood that the wifely role would also include running
schools, taking in orphans and boarders and organising prayer meetings
and Bible classes – that is, acting as an unpaid helpmate. The 1811 LMS
Candidates Papers stated that the qualities of the wives would be taken into
consideration and that, although the wife’s role would primarily be to take
care of the household, “the time which can be spared from domestic affairs,
shall be devoted to Missionary Purposes, more especially among the female
heathen and their children, both in promoting their civilisation… and their
religious instruction”.[^33]

The exciting picture painted of missionary life abroad omitted the practical
challenges of life in the foreign missions. John Darch, writing about the
hardships of life in the tropics for missionaries, has argued that isolation and
loneliness “should be seen as the key determining factor underpinning, and
to a large extent exacerbating, all the other hardships of missionary life”.[^34]
Life in Singapore was not as isolated as that of missionaries in the remote
areas of Africa or the Pacific – by 1823, Raffles had written that Singapore
“has become a great Emporium” and “a fine field for European speculation,”[^35]
and by the following year the population was already over 10,000.[^36]

Nonetheless, the settlement in the early years was small and not without
some dangers, since “the flipside to the successful emporium was an
underbelly of piracy, injustice and… secret societies, vice and opium”.[^37]
There is no suggestion that it was in this sense inherently *dangerous* for the LMS missionaries – unlike for the first resident Catholic priest, Father
Albrand, who arrived in Singapore in 1833. His attempts to convert Chinese
workers led to him being regarded by the secret societies as the “Head of the
Devil” – his catechist was followed daily and converts were threatened with
having their clothes removed and pigtails cut off.[^38]

Still, Singapore was a long way from England and life was very different.
Europeans were vastly outnumbered by the Chinese, Malay, Indian, Bugis
and other inhabitants, and learning their languages to a standard where
translations of texts could be done was a major undertaking. Letters took
months to send and receive, and the long delays in receiving approvals,
directions and support from the LMS directors in London often caused
additional stress. Samuel Milton wrote despairingly of his “great distress”
that he had only received one letter from the directors in three years.[^39]  The
East India Company tolerated missionaries as long as they did not interfere
with trade, and realised that they could be useful in providing services such
as schools that the Company did not want to fund itself.

Yet, while they were accepted in British colonial society, it was a very small
community, and that of the missionaries even smaller – getting along on a
personal level was crucial but sometimes difficult, and differences in opinion
were at times challenging, as in the Malacca mission where some felt that
there was an over-emphasis on Chinese translations and printing at the
expense of Malay. Overall, it seems likely that all of the missionaries felt
some measure of linguistic and cultural isolation. Johnston has suggested
that missionary figures were “anomalous in a colonial environment” and
“always conscious of their liminality”.[^40]

Along with this, there was the overarching and ongoing task of seeking
converts. In Singapore, the missionaries handed out their Christian texts free-of-
charge and proselytised where they could. They were consistently critical
and disparaging of what they regarded as the veneration of idols in temples, but there were no instances of attempting to remove or damage them, unlike
some other mission fields such as the Pacific. There, as Ann Colley has noted:

   *The early missionary literature is replete with passages relishing the<br>
   conflagration of maraes (idol temples), the driving of large herds<br>
   of pigs into sacred enclosures, the hanging of gods disrobed of their<br>
   apparel, the public burning of idols, the drowning of ritual mats,<br>
   the throwing of the gods made of coral into the sea, and the forced<br>
   eating of food thought to contain the spirit of a god*.[^41]

Instead, Morrison and Milne, in particular, tried to approach mission
through the prism of cultural exchange – opening schools on auspicious
days, writing in the style of Confucian “morality books” and including
Christian themes in lessons on Confucian ethics.[^42] Milne often preached
in Chinese temples: on a visit to Penang in 1816, he wrote in his diary that
he “went to the temple of the goddess Kwan-Yin, whither a great number of
Chinese followed. I stood up on the altar, addressed them, and gave away
many tracts”.[^43]

The Singapore missionaries were generally politely tolerated in the Chinese
and Malay communities, with tracts being accepted and at times discussed.
It seems likely, though, that at least to some extent, they were also regarded
as strange beings.[^44] When the Anglican church was being built in 1838,
there were rumours that trespassers were being killed and their heads put
into a hole in the church to feed the devils that lived there.[^45] In the Malay
community, Thomsen found it hard to retain pupils and believed that this was because the Sultan’s men claimed that the children were being taught
English so that they could be enslaved and taken to England.[^46] 

Despite the missionary efforts, there were no conversions in the early years.
Baptisms were likely to have been of babies born to existing Christians –
three from 1826 to 1830, four from 1836 to 1840 and five from 1841 to 1845.[^47]
Thorne, noting that the 1830s and 1840s were the high point of LMS
popularity in Britain, has commented on the paradox that foreign missions
enjoyed their greatest metropolitan support during their* least* successful
period in the field.[^48]

Along with the stresses of continuing their work without seeing the
conversions they sought, premature death, illness and incapacity were
always risks. In Alexander Wylie’s *Memorials of Protestant Missionaries to
the Chinese*, he lists the causes of violent deaths as being by: the Battak
cannibals in Sumatra; pirates on the way from Shanghai to Ningpo; pirates
on the Min river; (two) by the *neen fei* rebels in Shantung; and the natives
in Corea.[^49] Others died by a fall off a horse in Canton during a typhoon; a
fall through a bridge while on horseback into a canal in Ningpo; drowned
in the river Menam in Siam; drowned in a wreck off the coast of China;
died during a typhoon on the passage to Hong Kong; and by the capsizing
of a schooner between Canton and Hong Kong. Eight others died of natural
causes while on board ships.

For wives, childbirth was another potential danger. On the voyage from
Macao to Malacca in 1814, Rachel Milne gave birth to premature twins.
There was no doctor on board the ship and they had no servant with them
(to save money). She suffered from a severe fever after birth, but still had to
nurse the twins and care for her other child.[^50]

By 1818, the LMS directors had introduced a series of resolutions
consolidating and defining the status of missionaries’ wives, particularly
what would happen to them and their children in the event of their
husbands’ deaths. Given that the women were not considered missionaries
in their own right, it is surprising that the directors had resolved that the
engagement was not dissolved upon the death of a husband, rather “[the
wife would] be expected to remain at her station, or exert herself according
to her ability in the maintenance of her self and family, and generally to
promote the objects of the mission”.[^51]

These widows had to apply to leave the mission, were given one year’s “frugal
maintenance”, and had to take measures to “procure a subsistence”. Orphans
were not to be sent back to Europe unless friends had agreed to cover their
costs. Manktelow has argued that this reflected the ongoing ambivalence in
the LMS toward women in mission and their fear that women and children
would be a drain on resources. Public support nonetheless eventually led to
the establishment of a Widows and Orphans Fund in 1824.[^52]

In these difficult circumstances, missionary wives juggled their domestic
and (unpaid) mission roles, taking on tasks such as running small schools
for children, often in their own homes. In Singapore, various schools were
started by LMS missionary wives. Mrs Thomsen, for example, ran a school
for Malay girls in 1823. It offered both day classes and boarding, and classes
in reading, writing, arithmetic and sewing.[^53] Most schools, though, were
short-lived, failing for a range of reasons, including language difficulties
and, no doubt as Christine Doran has surmised (and which could apply to
both genders and to their work generally), “the missionaries were intruders
in a cultural milieu they did not fully comprehend”.[^54]

While reports from male missionaries often contained brief mentions of
the number of children attending the schools, the history of LMS missions
has been based on reports of male missionaries to male directors, resulting in the wives’ contributions being largely overlooked. Doran has noted the
absence of women from the accounts of the Strait Settlement missions, and
argued that “missionary women have been stranded in something of an
historiographical lacuna”.[^55] Interestingly, this lack of recognition has been
countered to some extent today in Singapore with the inclusion of Maria
Dyer in the Singapore Women’s Hall of Fame.[^56] 

Maria came to Singapore in 1842 with her missionary husband Samuel
Dyer, and started a small day and boarding school for Chinese girls. When
her husband died the next year and she left Singapore, the school could
easily have closed like so many others. In this case, the school was taken
over by the Society for the Promotion of Female Education in China, India
and the East and evolved into St Margaret’s School, which still exists today.

#### **Printing Challenges**
Translation of Christian texts into local languages as well as printing and
distributing texts were at the core of the LMS approach to mission. Today
this seems a simple matter but in the early 1800s, it was an enormous
challenge. The LMS missionaries first had to learn the languages; Milne,
perhaps exasperated, wrote: “To acquire the Chinese is a work for men with
bodies of brass, lungs of steel, heads of oak, hands of spring-steel, eyes of
eagles, hearts of apostles, memories of angels, and lives of Methuselah!”[^57]

Thomsen’s Malay tutor was clearly frustrated with his pupil who insisted
that he knew best how to speak Malay, with Abdullah writing that “he
does not want to learn the language but to ruin it”, and “people quickly
recognise the work done by Mr Thomsen, the words only being in Malay,
the construction in English which does not resemble Malay style”.[^58] They
also often published in romanised Malay which was difficult for many
Malays to read, as they were used to Jawi, an Arabic language adapted for use in writing Malay. Added to this were the difficulties inherent in
translating some Christian concepts, such as the Holy Spirit and Son of
God, into other languages.[^59]

Printing presses and types had to be procured or made by hand – which
was no easy task. Printing was done by xylography (carved wooden blocks),
letterpress or lithography but acquiring the right equipment was a continual
challenge, often requiring repeated requests to London. The press used for
the printing of Raffles’ proclamations in 1823 was a small hand press that
Thomsen brought from Penang – his report to the directors told them of
its successful use and included the plea, “the little travelling Press is merely
provided with a small quantity of Malay types &amp; old Engl. Types barely
enough to set up 4 pages smo [*sic*] which will be nearly worn out in 12
months – regular Bookprinting must be deferred ’till the Directors supply
our wants”.[^60]

It also meant that the missionaries had to be resourceful and innovative.
Samuel Dyer, who worked in Malacca, Penang and Singapore, pioneered
the printing of Chinese characters by metallic types, rather than
xylography. This was a major undertaking. He first prepared a list of the
most common characters, then a list of how many would be needed for
missionary printing, and finally, through trial and error, determined the
best way to make the metal types, eventually using punches and matrices.
He is acknowledged as being the first to create a Chinese font of useful
cast type.[^61] Despite these challenges, it is estimated that between 1810 and
1836, the combined output of the Ultra-Ganges Mission was 751,763 books
and tracts (of which 66,000 were printed in Singapore) – almost eight
million pages.[^62]

Yet, even when material was successfully printed, was it read? In early colonial
Singapore, literacy levels were low and it is unknown just how many of the
printed tracts, books and magazines could be read or were read. Low literacy
levels, problems with translation, the use of romanised Malay – all of these
factors added to difficulties. Many of the works were fragile, with paper covers
and held together by cotton thread. They were also free until Keasberry later
insisted on distributing them only to those who were literate. The writer
of a letter published in the *Singapore Chronicle* in 1830 complained that “I
occasionally observe these said Tracts used for the purpose of protecting the
Fruit on the Vines in some of the Chinamen’s gardens”.[^63]

It is also possible that some were taken for subsequent sale – Thomas
Beighton in Penang complained that he sometimes met his own books
for sale at the door of the mission, and Milne discovered that a Catholic
missionary was gathering up his books and burning them.[^64] Some could
have also been read with interest. Beighton had developed a friendship
with Sultan Ahmad of Kedah and gave him a copy of the New Testament,
writing that the sultan had “so far sanctioned it as to say that part was
received by the Islams but not the whole”.[^65] Similarly, Walter Medhurst was
asked by the Sultan of Trengganu to explain “what our books said about
the judgement day and the world to come”.[^66] Significantly, several students
at Keasberry’s boarding school were members of the Johore Royal family,
including Abu Bakar, who later became the Sultan of Johore.

#### **Printing Legacies, Imagined Communities**
There had been some isolated early printing in the region before the arrival
of the LMS . In 1545, the Catholic priest Francis Xavier translated several
prayers and commandments into Malay in Malacca.[^67] Later, in 1629, the Dutch East India Company financed a Malay translation of the Bible.[^68] It
is the LMS , however, that has been credited with having introduced mass
communication to Peninsula Malaya and Singapore through its book and
journal publishing, and through its dictionaries and school texts that were
used long after its formal demise in Singapore.[^69] In the early period, there
were key achievements, particularly from the Malacca mission.

The *Chinese Monthly Magazine* (1815–21) was the first Chinese magazine
produced in Malaya and, besides evangelical material, contained articles
on general knowledge and science. It has also been credited with being the
beginning of modern journalism in China as it inspired writers there.[^70] *The
Indo-Chinese Gleaner* (1817–21) was the first completely Western periodical
produced in the peninsular, and included “miscellaneous notices relative
to the philosophy, mythology, history, and literature of the Indo-Chinese
nations; drawn chiefly from the native languages”.[^71] Milne and Morrison’s
1823 translation of the Bible into Chinese was the first in Southeast Asia and
the second anywhere.[^72] In Singapore, Thomsen produced *Bustan Arifin* from
1821 to 1822, the first Malay magazine to be published in the peninsula, and
he has been described as “a forgotten pioneer of Bugis translated works”.[^73] 

Significantly, too, although printing in Jawi had been done earlier by
Medhurst in Batavia, Keasberry perfected the technique of lithographic
printing in Jawi. Among these were Keasberry’s magazine, the *Cermin
Mata* (*The Eye-Glass*), “crafted in beautifully decorated multi-coloured
lithography”, and Abdullah’s books, considered to be the first printed works that could be comfortably read by literate Malays.[^74] This has been described
as a major initiative in Malay publishing. Ian Proudfoot has been critical of
earlier missionary efforts that he considered as difficult for Malay readers
to read or understand, being often printed “in clumsy jawi typefaces” or
“in an alien Roman script”, and in “sometimes nonsensical Malay idiom”.
In contrast, he admired Keasberry’s works as “beautifully decorated multicoloured
lithographs, giving a creditable imitation of the rubrication and
illumination found in superior manuscripts”.[^75] 

Yet, Proudfoot also contrasted these printed works, designed for individual
reading, with the practice of the Quran schools where texts were read aloud.
He described this transition from recitation to individual silent reading as
“the silencing of texts”, so that printing turned texts into products.[^76] He
argued that the publication of material in Malay and the fact that many
missionary works were printed in roman script, was “able to influence Malay
literate culture, drawing it in the direction of the West”, so that “the new
printing technology… had, in the Muslim world, an impact comparable to
that of Gutenberg’s typography in the West”.[^77] 

Benedict Anderson famously proposed that nations are a social construct,
that they are “imagined communities”.[^78] He argued that this was historically
brought about by the introduction of the printing press, which enabled the
circulation of many copies of books and other printed works at an affordable
cost. As newspapers were developed and widely disseminated, people read
the same information and in the process, came to think of themselves as
part of a broader shared community. I suggest that this is part of the larger
significance of the introduction of the printing press into the region by the
LMS . As missionaries, they would have liked to have seen an “imagined” Christian community – but that was not to be. Yet perhaps they did help to
bring about a more literate community with new ideas of the larger world,
and one that could begin to think of “Singapore”, and the region, and its
place in that world.


#### **Agents of Empire?**
Historians are still debating the role of missionaries in the British Empire:
were they insensitive agents of empire, imposing their views of civilisation,
or did they improve people’s lives with their values, schools and medical
programmes – or both?[^79] I argue that the LMS missionaries in the Straits
Settlements were not overtly imperialistic, but it is fair to say that, through
their evangelical efforts, and by undertaking government and commercial
printing, they helped to enforce colonial rule and ideas of modernity.

Interestingly, there has been a similar debate about Abdullah, who was
Muslim but worked closely with Raffles and then the LMS missionaries
(as well as Alfred North of the ABCFM). He admired western technology
such as the camera and wrote favourably of Raffles and Farquhar – although
neither mentioned him in print or in their letters[^80] – and neither Milne nor
Thomsen referred to Abdullah by name in their reports to the directors.[^81] 
Abdullah has been described as both the “Father of Malay literature” and
as a mouthpiece for the British, invoking, as Amin Sweeney put it, “the
double-headed formula of Father vs Stooge”.[^82] 

John Roxborogh has argued for a balanced evaluation of the LMS in
the region, which neither undervalues nor overestimates their work. He
noted that it was the missionaries who published Abdullah’s writings, who
recorded aspects of local religious practice and culture that might otherwise have been lost, and argued that “if some missionaries were not especially
competent, others like Milne and Keasberry were able and sensitive”.[^83] 

Amid this debate, what is clear is that the LMS missionaries were an
important part of the early history of colonial Singapore and the region, and
made a significant contribution to early printing in the Straits Settlements.

(From JSTOR via NLB’s [eResources](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/) website). Tony Ballantyne has estimated that, amongst missionaries to New Zealand, missionary wives died significantly earlier that their husbands – on the North Island, wives died on average in their early 40s, compared to husbands in their early 70s; and on the South Island, husbands outlived their wives by an average of 9 years – see Tony Ballantyne, _Entanglements of Empire: Missionaries, Maori, and the Question of the Body_ (Durham: Duke University Press, 2014), 179.

On a broader level, the field of “missionary linguistics” has grown up in recent years to study the grammars and dictionaries written by missionaries, since how a language is described and translated operates to establish norms, potentially influencing the way the language is understood and taught, as well as the cultural perception of the language.
