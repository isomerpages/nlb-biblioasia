My wife Esther reminded me that it was a miracle, considering what she did in Bali in June 1975. It was our first visit to the famed island and we chose to stay in Kuta. It was all sea, sand, waves and coconut trees. We even asked a boy to climb a tree to pluck coconuts for us to drink the water. There were no buildings on the beach.

The surfing waves were not suitable for swimming but we found ways to enjoy ourselves. We allowed the waves to toss and roll us onto the sand, taking repeated tumbles, sometimes all shook-up and even painfully so. We did this twice a day over three to four days.

We loved one particular item and bought it, a beautifully carved full-length 1½-foot sculpture of the Hindu goddess Sita, made from tree bark and which weighed 10 pounds. On the way home, I was feverish and Esther had to carry the piece back to Singapore all by herself. Back home, she too became feverish a few days later and discovered she was pregnant. Wow, we thought, how lucky she was, what with all the tumbles she took in Kuta and carrying a heavy piece of sculpture, that nothing happened to her baby, our baby!

I became a father on 15 February 1976. My daughter Sha Min was born in Kandang Kerbau Hospital. There were two facts remarkable about her birth: the first that it was long and difficult, needing 20 hours of labour; and second, at the time of her birth, the government public maternity hospital held the record of delivering the most number of babies per year in the world. This record, which the hospital held from 1966 to 1976, may have later contributed to the government’s fear of overpopulation and prompted it to regulate birth as an official policy.

In the midst of her long labour when her pain became unbearable, my wife asked a nurse about epidural intervention and was confronted by the cold question from one of the nurses, “Who told you about epidural?” So the birth was natural, but the experience certainly did not make her feel she would like another baby in the near future.

Sha Min (善敏) means kind and alert. Esther was adamant that she did not want her first daughter to have a name that has a *Nonya* syllable, such as Gek, Geok, Poh, Neo, as my mother had lined up traditional names for her first grand-daughter. I agreed and so we consulted a Chinese almanac that took into account time, date of birth and gender, a process managed by Esther’s late father, who is Cantonese.

What was it like to be a father for the first time and a daughter as the firstborn? 1976 was the year of the dragon and a traditional Chinese father would expect a boy who could continue to bear the Yeo surname.

I wrote a poem about it.

<b>A Dragon for the Family</b>
<br><br>
<b>For My Daughter Sha Min</b>

Hushed, we hovered between rabbit
and dragon,<br>
Between a whitish squeak and
flaming breath.<br>
When you declined to be a rabbit, like<br>
Your father, the hush dissolved,<br>
and I was pleased<br>
Knowing how auspicious the dragon is.<br>
I was prepared to wait, but it’s lovely<br>
To be scorched so soon, as long<br>
as you will<br>
Promise not to burn our house to<br>
the ground<br>
<br><br>
Girl or boy, your sex didn’t really matter.<br>
I’m not the traditional Chinese father<br>
Who needs a son to continue his line<br>
And swell his clan. My brothers may <br>
	line up,<br>
And my clan of two-and-a-half million,<br>
Though small, is big enough for me,<br>
for us.<br>
I don’t know whether small is beautiful,<br>
But since we have no choice, let’s<br>
make it so.<br>
<br><br>
Sha Min, sweetheart, you know<br>
this prayer<br>
I offer you is really not a prayer as<br>
You are born in a good year in a good place,<br>
The prospect of water-rationing<br>
notwithstanding…<br>
Say rather that I’m offering you a hope,<br>
One of the many hopes; and so as<br>
not to seem<br>
Arbitrary, let there be three, yes three,<br>
As this is the year of the three-<br>
clawed dragon.<br>
