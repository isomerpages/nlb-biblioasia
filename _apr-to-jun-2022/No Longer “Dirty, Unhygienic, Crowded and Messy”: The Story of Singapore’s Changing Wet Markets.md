#### Wet markets have existed in Singapore since 1825. **Zoe Yeo** looks at how these markets have changed over time.

To most people in Singapore, the wet market is so much a part of the landscape that it is barely worth noticing. However, the term is not in common use around the world. It was only in early 2020, at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, that the term “wet markets” was thrust into the international limelight. The first diagnosed cases were linked to the former Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market (now closed) in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. The coronavirus was classified as a zoonotic disease,[^1] which raises speculation that the virus had jumped from wild animals sold at that market to humans. 

To explain the concept of a wet market, the National Geographic in April 2020 described it as “large collections of open-air stalls selling fresh seafood, meat, fruits, and vegetables”. These markets “sell and slaughter live animals on site, including chickens, fish, and shellfish”. The “wet” in wet markets is attributed to “live fish splashing in tubs of water, melting ice keeping meat cold, the blood and innards of slaughtered animals”. [^2] Unfortunately, “wet market” is often conflated with “wildlife market” even though most wet markets don’t sell wildlife.

Although the interest in wet markets, particularly the one in Wuhan, skyrocketed in 2020, many are unaware that the term “wet market” may have first arisen in Singapore. The term began to appear in the late 1970s. A Straits Times article published on 13 July 1978 noted that the Trade Department said that it was “reluctant to introduce the sale of frozen fish in ‘wet’ markets for fear of profiteering by hawkers” and also “fear that some hawkers may thaw the fish and sell it as fresh”.[^3] The use of quote marks around the word wet suggests that it was a novel term.

The term “wet market” was formally recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary in 2016 and was defined as a “market for the sale of fresh meat, fish, and produce” in Southeast Asia.[^4] 

Prior to “wet markets”, the words “market” and pasar were commonly used in local newspapers. The Malay word pasar is a loanword from “bazaar” which originated from Persia to refer to a town’s public market district.[^5] Pasar was so widely used locally that the transliteration of the Malay word, 巴刹 (ba sha), was coined and it became the official Chinese term used for wet markets in Singapore and in some parts of Southeast Asia.[^6]

Singapore’s Early Wet Markets

Although there is a lack of documentation on markets in the pre-colonial era, evidence shows that markets and bazaars have appeared organically where trading took place. These markets were makeshift sites scattered across the island, where vendors would lay out their produce on the ground or in baskets, in open areas or under a shed.[^7]

The Telok Ayer Market is believed to be the first purpose-built market in Singapore. In November 1822, Stamford Raffles appointed a Town Committee to implement his vision of reorganising the town that had grown in a haphazard manner. In his directive, he wrote: “As a measure of police it is proposed to remove the fish market to Tulloh [Telok]
