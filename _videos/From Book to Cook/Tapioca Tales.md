#### **Episode summary** ####
Because there was a rice shortage during the Japanese Occupation, people ate sweet potato and tapioca instead. Lee Geok Boi shows us what the human imagination is capable of by taking the humble tapioca and turning into two delicious dishes, using only ingredients that were available in Japanese-occupied Singapore.

#### **Recipes**
Geok Boi's recipes are inspired by tapioca noodles that were sold during wartime, and memories of her father's tapioca dessert. 

<b>Tapioca noodles</b>
Tapioca Noodles 
Makes about 500 g noodles
Serves 4

1 heaped rice bowl tapioca chunks (about 150 g)
1 rice bowl water
1 heaped rice bowl grated tapioca (about 150 g)
1 heaped rice bowl tapioca starch (150 g)
1½ tsp salt
Coconut milk (optional)
Cold water

1 pot boiling water
1 large bowl cold water
1 cutting board, oiled lightly


<b>Boiled tapioca with grated coconut</b>
<br>500 g tapioca, peeled and cut into chunks
<br>200 g gula melaka or to taste
<br>1/2 tsp. salt 
<br>500 ml water / thin coconut milk ( coconut milk optional) 
1. Put all ingredients into a pot and boil till tapioca chunks are done, fluffy and dryish. 
2. Add more water if needed. The amount of water needed will depend on the size of chunks. 
3. To check for doneness, stick a fork into the largest piece and break it up. 
4. When little liquid is left, stir and turn over the tapioca frequently to prevent burning. A few burnt spots are fragrant though. 
5. To serve, sprinkle freshly grated coconut or a squeeze of coconut cream.
