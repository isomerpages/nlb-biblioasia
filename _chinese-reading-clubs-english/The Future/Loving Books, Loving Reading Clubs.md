#### **Introduction**
The concept of reading clubs is still quite new to me, showing that my engagement with reading remains in its early stages. This realisation fills me with excitement about reading clubs and makes me understand that it is time to take the first step and embark on a new reading journey.

#### **Books: A Unifying Force**
The ocean of books is vast and boundless. Successful reading clubs make book lovers cherish reading even more, while those who have not yet entered the "golden house of books" gradually come to discover and appreciate the wonders within books. As the saying goes, "joy shared is joy doubled". By pooling our collective wisdom and exchanging insights and reflections, we achieve strength in unity! In today's age of digital technology and information overload, tangible physical books deserve even greater promotion and advocacy.

#### **The Joy of Shared Reading**
Reading clubs bring people together to read the same book, allowing more works to receive attention and appreciation, undoubtedly prompting readers to engage in deeper reflection, develop diverse interpretations, and gain fresh insights. As long as reading clubs serve as platforms for intellectual exchange and shared discussion, good reading habits will gradually take root. A love of books and a love of reading clubs share common ideals – not only can they coexist harmoniously, but they can also complement each other. These bridges between people, built through knowledge, are truly beautiful and heartwarming.

#### **The Enduring Fragrance of Books**
The ancients said: “Three days without reading books, and one’s speech becomes dull, face becomes detestable, and words lose their flavour”. They also said: “A belly full of poetry and books naturally exudes elegance.” Reading both delights the spirit and cultivates refinement. From this, we can see that the fragrance of books endures forever and remains immortal!
