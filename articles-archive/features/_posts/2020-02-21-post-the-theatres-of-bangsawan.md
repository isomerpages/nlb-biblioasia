#### The Theatres of Bangsawan**

In the days before cinema, bangsawan performances entertained the masses. **Tan Chui Hua** looks at the rise and fall of bangsawan venues in Singapore.

In the early decades of the 20th century, before the days of cinema, residents of Singapore eagerly flocked to bangsawan[^2] performances to be entertained. Performed in Malay, bangsawan featured acting and singing as well as music provided by a live orchestra. Back then, it was one of the few forms of mass entertainment available.

Such was the draw of bangsawan in the pre-war years that people living in Tanjong Pagar would travel by bullock cart all the way to North Bridge Road to catch a performance at the purpose-built Theatre Royal. Mohamed Sidek bin Siraj, a former civil servant and bangsawan patron, recalls in his oral history account:

<center>“The third class is about $1 and the first class in front is about $3 or something… There’s no other entertainment for the Malays except bangsawan. Even that, it started after eight and then finished up at twelve. If you don’t have the transport you have to walk. People will use a bullock-cart from Tanjong Pagar to see bangsawan and say about 10 or 12 people will go back in a bullock cart to Tanjong Pagar.”[^3]</center>

Theatre Royal was just one of a handful of venues in Singapore that staged *bangsawan* performances. While much research has been carried out on the art of bangsawan, less has been written about the places that played host to such shows. Although secondary source materials on these venues are scant, by piecing together occasional mentions in newspaper reports, advertisements, archival records and oral history interviews, a story of the former theatres of *bangsawan* emerges.
