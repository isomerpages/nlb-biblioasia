#### **Introduction**

Xin Zhi Reading Club (formerly Sing Zhi Culture &amp; Education Development Association) was established in 1985 and has now been operating for forty years. Adhering to the mission of "serving society, promoting reading, and facilitating humanities education exchange," we continue to sow the seeds of reading. Since 1997, monthly reading club meetings have become the association's flagship activity; in 2002, we extended the reach of reading to prisons, establishing the "Prison Chinese Reading Club" and "Women's Prison Chinese Reading Club," using the power of books to bring hope to those in challenging circumstances.

As a non-political, non-profit, non-religious civil organisation, Xin Zhi Reading Club has always maintained open and inclusive principles. Over the years, we have facilitated discussions of over three hundred books, covering motivation, health, management, literature, essays, and even comics and picture books, providing rich intellectual nourishment for readers of different ages and interests.


#### **Writer-Reader Partnerships: Building Literary Connections**

Xin Zhi Reading Club actively engages in diverse collaborations with writers, aiming to foster meaningful exchanges between writers and readers. We have invited local writers such as Huai Ying (Lee Seng Chan), Lin Gao (Lim Hung Chang), Wu Mu (Teo Sum Lim), and Zhang Hui (Cheong Weng Yat) to share creative concepts and techniques in essays, poetry, short stories, and other literary forms.

Reading clubs not only bridge communication between writers and readers but also explore transforming written works into various art forms such as recitation and theatrical performance.

Given the challenges of book publishing in Singapore, we pay special attention to local authors' works each year, actively selecting them for book discussions and inviting authors to interact with readers in person. This allows readers to gain deeper insights into the creative process behind the works while providing authors with a valuable platform to receive reader feedback.

In recent years, some authors and publishers have proactively invited Xin Zhi Reading Club to host or co-host book launches, fully demonstrating the vital role reading clubs play in reading culture and showing tangible support for local literary creation.


#### **Cultivating Creativity: From Reading to Writing**

Xin Zhi Reading Club encourages members to actively participate in creative writing. We publish three issues of our "Newsletter" annually, serving as a platform for members' regular contributions. Additionally, we have successfully published two volumes of "Xin Zhi Essays," providing valuable publishing opportunities for members and witnessing their transformation from readers to writers.

#### **Envisioning the Future: Diverse and Dynamic Reading**

Looking ahead, we hope Singapore's reading clubs can continue exploring innovative formats, such as film reading clubs, drama reading clubs, music reading clubs, technology reading clubs, and more, inviting professionals from various fields to participate and share their knowledge and insights, making reading more diverse and creative. May reading clubs flourish like vibrant flowers across Singapore's fertile landscape, each with its own unique character, blooming brilliantly!
