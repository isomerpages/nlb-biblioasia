#### **Episode summary** ####
In 1967, the Singapore government launched the Eat More Wheat campaign to reduce the import of rice because it was expensive compared to wheat. Award-winning cookbook author and culinary instructor Christopher Tan tells us about the campaign and makes a unique milk noodle soup dish from a 1969 cookbook, which was published in conjunction with the campaign.
