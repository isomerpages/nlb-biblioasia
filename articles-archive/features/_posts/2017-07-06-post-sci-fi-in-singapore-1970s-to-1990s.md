#### The sci-fi frenzy took off in Singapore in 1978 when *Star Wars* was screened at cinemas here. **Nadia Arianna Bte Ramli** looks at sci-fi works produced between 1970s and 1990s.

The popularity of contemporary science fiction publications, such as LONTAR: The Journal of Southeast Asian Speculative Fiction (2013–), The Ayam Curtain (2012) and The Steampowered Globe (2012),1 point towards a sizable and growing base of readers who are fans of this genre of literature.

LONTAR, which published its eighth issue in April 2017, is a biannual literary journal featuring science fiction as well as fantasy, alternative histories and tales of the supernatural. The Ayam Curtain is similarly an anthology of speculative fiction envisioning what Singapore could be or might have been, while The Steampowered Globe by the Happy Smiley Writers Group is a collection of seven “steampunk” stories, a relatively new subgenre of science fiction that focuses on technology, specifically the industrial steam-powered machinery of the 19th century.

But when exactly did science fiction take off in Singapore? The genre is certainly no stranger to the Malayan literary scene; one of the earliest sci-fi publications on record dates back to 1953, when a Malay comic series released a sci-fi issue titled Tungga dan Piring Terbang (Tungga and the Flying Saucer). Published by the Malayan Indonesian Book and Magazine Store (MIBS) in Singapore, it was created by Indonesian comic artist Naz Achnas.[^2]
