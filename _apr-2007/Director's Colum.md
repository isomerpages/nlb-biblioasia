Not many Singaporeans know that Shuang Lin Monastery, the familiar landmark at one end of Toa Payoh, once played a significant role in the building of the Burma Road.  In the 1930s, volunteers from around Southeast Asia were trained to drive at the monastery before they were sent to the Burma Road to transport material to China in the Sino-Japanese War.

Linking Burma and China, the Burma Road was used to ferry equipment and war material in support of China in the 1937 war between China and Japan.  Cutting through rough mountain country and stretching 1,130 km long, it played a crucial logistical role in suppyling Chinese forces striking at the invading Japanese army.

That's a lesson in history that we learnt from one of our Lee Kong Chian Research Fellows, one of the first two researches who completed the Fellowship recently,  In this issue of BiblioAsia, you will get to see what they did, in two extracts from their papers that they presented soon after completing their research. The other feature explores the early education of Malayan gentlemen by British colonials. In case you think it is just another pieces of research on early education
