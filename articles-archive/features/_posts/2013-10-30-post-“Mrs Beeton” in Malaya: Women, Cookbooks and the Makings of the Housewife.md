#### Cookbooks offer interesting insights into the oft-overlooked domestic space of British Malaya, shedding light on how women saw themselves and how feminine ideals from the West were propagated in the colonial era.

Cookbooks, pamphlets, newspapers, domestic manuals and the like are rich sources of recipes, diet and nutrition advice as well as kitchen anecdotes and trivia. The non-literary and utilitarian nature of these writings belies their narrative potential as texts that contain rich socio-historical material on food-related culture. Despite their seeming inconsequentiality, details on everyday cooking and eating provide clues to wider debates about national, colonial, postcolonial, class, race and gender politics. English-language cookery texts published in early 20th century British Malaya provide a discursive space where women - whether writing, reading or practising the culinary arts - can participate in fashioning the feminine ideal.

Regarded as the paragon of progressive womanhood in the history of British domesticity, the legacy of Isabella Beeton's magnum opus, *Beeton's Book of Household Management* (1861), refigures Malayan cookery texts beyond the parochial, suggesting the influence of domestic discourses from Victorian England. Cookbooks reproduce dominant gendered ideologies as "explicit emblems of women's relegation to the domestic sphere - the world of the home."1 Yet boundaries shift and blur when these texts also demonstrate how women, ostensibly acting in their traditional capacities as housekeeper and caregiver, could influence the well-being of the family, the wider community and beyond.
 
This essay examines individuals in Malaya who were privileged enough to have received English language education, who saw the value of penning down what they knew and who possessed the wherewithal to publish their writings. The primary focus is on English-language cookbooks, largely due to the relative paucity of extant vernacular cookery texts published in the same period.

#### **The Recipe Book and its implications**

A recipe book may seem unique to the socio-cultural context in which it was written and published, but, it speaks across time when it borrows from earlier works and draws on the conventions of its genre. In contextualising the recipe book within the history of British publishing, Margaret Beetham said: "The systematic reproduction of cooking instructions in commercial forms of print was symptomatic of a much wider process by which oral knowledges (sic) were gradually superseded by print."2 Instructions on food preparation appeared as part of general household advice in printed books of "receipts" that predated the 19th century as well as in magazines and manuals that increasingly targeted a middle-class female readership since the 1850s.3 

Published in 1861, *Beeton's Book of Household Management* was instrumental to the birth of the recipe book as a popular print genre by the end of the century.' Its subsequent publishing history contributed to the transformation of cookery into a subject with its own distinct cultural form. The recipe book thus added to an existing body of writing that mapped the domestic sphere and exposed the otherwise hidden labour performed by women. By instructing women on their expected behaviour and responsibilities in the home, these texts reified and affirmed the assumed conjunction between femininity and domesticity.

Beeton's seminal work was typical of the general household manual of the time, providing an array of advice, anecdotes, trivia, historical notes and other information usually of tangential relevance to the recipes being discussed.5 As Beeton herself acknowledged in the preface of her book, she obtained the bulk of this material from readers' contributions to the first successful middle-class woman's magazine in Britain, *The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine*, published by Isabella's husband, Samuel Beeton.

Her volume nevertheless contained an innovation that has since become a defining characteristic of the recipe book. Beeton "codified a previously cha¬otic body of knowledge"6 by introducing a standard format for organising and pre¬senting recipes in a systematic way. This includes the listing of ingredients (by weight) followed by the method of prepa¬ration and estimated cost for a given rec¬ipe, arranging recipes in alphabetical order and providing an index to facilitate the location of information within the dense text.' Furthermore, cooking meth¬ods were elaborated in a straightforward and impersonal style.
In this way, Beeton's volume delin¬eated the practicalities of running the home with
