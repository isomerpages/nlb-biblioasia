**About**:	Xin Yue Reading Community is an offline collaborative reading and in-depth discussion platform organised by founder Grace Guo Lin Jing. Through regular reading and exchange, it aims to help members broaden their thinking, deepen their understanding, and explore the healing power of reading.

The book club distinguishes itself through its strong interactivity and high participation levels. The book club centres around the philosophy of "reading oneself, transcending oneself, and delighting oneself", encouraging participants to understand themselves through reading, transcend limitations, and find joy in reading.
