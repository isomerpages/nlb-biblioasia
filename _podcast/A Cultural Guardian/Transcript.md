<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>In 1986, Times Books published a Malay cookbook titled <em>Hidangan Warisan Kita</em>.
The name, which translates as “Our Heritage Dishes”, was an important book,
because it was the publisher’s first all-Malay cookbook. The book contains
178 traditional recipes and was written by Hajah Asfiah Haji Abdullah,
who’s also known as Cikgu Asfiah. Cikgu Asfiah has been described as a
teacher and guardian of traditional Malay culture. In addition to writing
a cookbook, she was a well-known <em>mak andam</em>, which is a Malay wedding
attendant, and her stall was a regular fixture at the annual Ramadan food
fare at Bussorrah Street. In addition, she was a teacher all her life.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>I’m Jimmy Yap, and Toffa Abdul Wahed is with me to talk about Cikgu Asfiah.
Toffa is a Librarian at the National Library of Singapore, and she was
also a guest in an episode of the National Library’s cooking show “From
Book to Cook”. In that episode, she made a dish from Cikgu Asfiah’s cookbook
called <em>bunga kobis.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi Toffa, welcome to BiblioAsia+.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
<br>Hi, Jimmy.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Thank you for joining us today. I’m very excited that you’re here with
us again to talk about – this time about another cookbook author, Cikgu
Asfiah. And you know, what I’m really intrigued about is that, you know,
you took a dish from Cikgu Asfiah’s cookbook and made it for the National
Library’s cooking show. What’s it called?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
<br>It’s called <em>bunga kobis</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Ah it’s called <em>bunga kobis</em>. And it’s actually a dish I’ve never
heard of. You know, tell us a bit about this dish, what is <em>bunga kobis</em>.
Is it really a flower of the cabbage?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
<br>Yes. Okay, so <em>bunga</em> in Malay means flower. <em>Kobis</em> means cabbage.
So, when you look at the finished dish, once you’ve made it – a laboriously
long process of making the <em>bunga kobis</em> – you’re supposed to cut
it open, and it will appear as a blossoming flower.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Wow. Okay.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
<br>Like a flower – <em>bunga</em>. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>That sounds very pretty. Can you describe it?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
<br>Okay, like you, I hadn’t heard of the dish before. So <em>bunga kobis</em> is
what Cikgu Asfiah classifies under <em>gubahan</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>What does that mean?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
<br><em>Gubahan</em> is the Malay word for a composition or an arrangement.
And in the culinary context, it could refer to an elaborately arranged
or prepared dish that consists of several components from garnish to decorative
items. To create, in a sense, a dish that is complete and visually appealing.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Was it a special dish?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
<br>It was. <em>Gubahan</em> is usually used as part of the <em>hantaran</em>.
So <em>hantaran</em> in Malay means “a gift”. Okay the word <em>hantar</em> is
to deliver or to send something. So, for instance, at a wedding, the bridal
party would send gifts or <em>hantaran</em> to the groom and vice versa.
So <em>bunga kobis</em> was, at a certain point of time, a popular and trendy
dish to include in your <em>hantaran</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>How would you describe this dish?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
<br>It is a multi-layered <em>murtabak</em>, not pan fried or griddle fried,
but deep fried. So, it consists of making dough – pastry dough – and then
making your filling. So, in this case, it’s minced beef or minced meat
that’s been stir fried and cooked with aromatics – cumin, coriander seed,
fennel, some onion, chili and Chinese celery. Yeah. And then, you would
then put the filling in, wrap the dough up into, like, a parcel, and then
fry it, deep fry it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
<br>But that’s not where it stops, because you have to do this process another
five times to create six layers. So, it’s like inception. It’s a puzzle
within a puzzle.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Yeah. Okay. That sounds quite cool.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
<br>And when you cut it open, it looks like the layers of a cabbage.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Hence the name.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
<br>Yes. Hence the <em>bunga kobis</em> name.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>You’ve never made this dish before until, you know, we asked you to.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
<br>That’s right.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Why did you pick this dish? It sounds very hard, I would say.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
<br>Yeah. It would be the last dish I would pick. I chose this dish after
much deliberation and actually after speaking to Khir Johari, the author
of <em>The Food of Singapore Malays</em>, which was published in 2021. I
spoke to him to learn more about Hajah Asfiah, or Cikgu Asfiah, right.
And talked about, you know, possibly which dish to make. And he was like,
“You’ve got to make this. <em>Bunga kobis</em>, this is the pièce de résistance
of, you know, Malay wedding <em>hantaran</em>. This dish is actually on
the book cover of <em>Hidangan Warisan Kita</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>I see.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
<br>But before I agreed or rather decided to make this dish for the episode
of “From Book to Cook”, I asked my mum whether she knew anything about
it. And my mum was like, “I’m not sure, you should ask your aunty, who
was a <em>mak andam</em>, like Asfiah.” Yeah. So, I asked my aunt and she
was like, “Oh, I made it for your mum’s wedding. How could she forget?”
So, I went to find the photos of my parents’ wedding. And, yeah, there
it was. Her bridal party.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Your mum’s bridal party?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
<br>Yeah. She had given this as one of the <em>hantaran</em> gifts to my dad’s
side.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>And so you actually have a photograph in the family album? The wedding
album?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
<br>Yes. There in the corner, the blossoming cabbage.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>How amazing.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
<br>Yeah.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Was that what convinced you to make it?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
<br>I think so. I was like, okay, this was a dish that was present at my parents’
wedding, and I would like to give it a go, taste it for myself. And yeah,
honour that, you know, as a homage to my parents in a way.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>That’s wonderful. Was it a hard dish to master?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
<br>It put me totally out of my comfort zone, because, firstly, [of] two very
technical things. Firstly, deep frying, and secondly making pastry dough.
Yeah. I practiced it three times before I had to cook it for the episode.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Did you get better each time? I hope you did.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
<br>Yeah. The first time was a total failure. I was like, “Why did I choose
this dish? Maybe I should change it to another dish.”&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>What happened?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
<br>Okay, so in the process of making the layers right, you must make sure
that you do not tear any of the layers once there’s a hole or a breach
in the structure of this <em>bunga kobis</em>, oil would seep in and basically
flood the insides of your dish and [make] the dough very soggy. So yes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay, so that was attempt number one.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
<br>Yeah. And also, like the equipment I used – not ideal. But I did follow
the recipe that Cikgu Asfiah put out because she wrote to use either a
wok or a pot. So, I chose a wok because I didn’t have a deep enough pot
for this dish. Because when you make the layers right, the <em>kueh</em> itself,
the <em>bunga kobis</em> will become heavy, and it will become big.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>How big? Give us an idea how big it is. Like, okay. A head of a cabbage?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>Yeah, it’s like a head on a cabbage. Like, slightly smaller than a rugby
ball.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Okay, Sounds pretty big.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>Heavier than a rugby ball. Okay. Yeah. So imagine carrying this heavy
item while deep frying. You might drop it into the oil. You might hurt
yourself. So, my aunt, who was the <em>mak andam,</em> when I told her, she
was like, “What are you using?” So, I told her, “I am using a wok. I’m
using a ladle that’s for oil, and tongs.” And she said, “No, you can’t
use any of those things, because tongs might break the skin of the dish.
And that’s how oil got in.” And that’s actually what happened when I tried
it the first time. She made this dish because at that time in the 80s it
was very trendy to have this dish or, rather, a collection of dishes called, <em>dua manis dua pedas</em>.</p>
<p>Two sweet items and two spicy items.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>For the <em>hantaran</em>?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>Yes. So <em>bunga kobis</em> falls under the <em>pedas</em>. Yeah. So, this
was one of the dishes that she would make whenever her client requested
for <em>dua manis dua pedas</em>. And it was very, very normal to have <em>dua manis dua pedas</em> at
your wedding. You would need to use a deep pot, and she would use a very
small rolling pin, of wooden rolling pin, that you use for making your <em>pao</em>,
the very thin ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To use it as like a backbone of the dish and to use it as something easy
to grab on to remove the big cabbage head from the hot oil. Yeah. No tongs,
because the tongs would tear the skin. Yeah. But, of course, at that time
I was like, you know, I already practiced with this, I would just go ahead
with it. So, that’s why you see, in the episode I stuck to the tongs. I
stuck to the wok. yeah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Well, was that what [Cikgu Asfiah] recommended – using tongs or…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>She did not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>She expected you to figure it out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>Yes. Yeah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>All right. This recipe was on the cover of <em>Hidangan Warisan Kita</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>That’s right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>And you had never eaten it, but so did your family enjoy your failed attempts
at making <em>bunga kobis</em>, the earlier attempts before you went into
the studio?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>Okay, so the first time the pastry became very soggy, right? Because there
was a breach in the system. But we ended up just eating the filling – the
minced meat filling. It was good. It was delicious. Okay. Yeah. Perfectly
fine on its own. Right. Yeah. but it’s a dish that you would not eat a
large amount of, because it’s very rich, it’s deep fried. It can be greasy.
So, when I did ask my aunty, like, “How would you eat this dish? How do
you share it?” She said, “Yeah, you just cut it out. Everyone takes a small
portion just to taste.” Yeah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>So, no one is expected to eat the whole thing. You just get a small, small
bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>Yeah. And I mentioned earlier it’s part of, it’s a <em>gubahan</em> dish,
meaning it comes as a very elaborately prepared dish. So, in Asfiah’s recipe
she recommends putting tomato flowers as a garnish. So, you would have
to then know how to make a tomato flower, which I had to practice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Did you know how to make the tomato flower?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>I didn’t. And she didn’t, she didn’t put any instructions on how to make
one. So, you know, I had to YouTube it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Thank God for YouTube.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>Yes, thank God for YouTube. Learn how to make the different types of flowers.
And I went for the easiest one. Yeah. And you also need a bed of lettuce
to kind of form the base.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Ah. Okay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>To put the beautiful flower cabbage on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Is it typically served cut already or as a whole?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>I saw two photos of it. There’s one photo of <em>bunga kobis</em> in the
National Archives of Singapore. It’s from a collection that covers Malay
weddings. I think it’s from a personal collection that was donated to National
Archives. I may be wrong, but the <em>bunga kobis</em> is also cut open already,
so it looks like it’s blossomed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The one that appears in my mum’s wedding photo is also cut open. But the
garnish is different. It’s not tomato flowers, but it was some chili flowers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Just to clarify for the people who didn’t, who haven’t watched the video,
a tomato flower is not like the flower of a tomato. It is a tomato cut
into the shape of a flower.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>Yes, you carve the tomato into a flower.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Yes. Which was quite impressive. I was admiring your handiwork with the
knife. Tell us about Cikgu Asfiah. You know, she sounds like an interesting
person and clearly an important person in safeguarding and preserving Malay
culture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>Yeah. I think one of the journalists called her an activist of Malay handicraft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>What does that mean? Why?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>Because she was so vocal, and she was always voicing out about having
to preserve, either through documentation or through sharing knowledge,
the traditional Malay arts for the younger generation. And she appeared
at many lectures, so people would invite her because of her expertise in
so many various forms of traditional Malay arts, not only the culinary
arts but also the arts to do with wedding customs, the art of embroidery,
needlework, flower arrangements, and even the cultural traditions of doing
traditional make up, hairdressing and accessories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, she was always invited to lectures. Of course, it was also part of
how she made her income, but she was so well-respected and esteemed that
she would appear at all these avenues related to Malay culture, such as
the Malay Cultural Fest that was held in the 70s and 80s to appear as the
person to talk about all these traditional forms of art. She was a teacher
for the earlier part of her life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Literally a teacher for a school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>Yeah, she was a schoolteacher. And after she retired from being a schoolteacher,
she continued teaching in other avenues, and she also became a <em>mak andam</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>So what do we know about Cikgu Asfiah? I mean, when was she born? Where
did she grow up?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>She was born in an area called Kampong Haji, which is today’s Bussorah
Street. So she was born in 1920, and you know, Kampong Glam in general,
or the area where Bussorah Street is located, right, was a very cosmopolitan
area comprising people from different parts of Nusantara or the Malay Archipelago
from the <a href="https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=1c347e28-5925-4992-8dad-e2d702bfe634" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Baweanese</u></a>,
the Javanese. She grew up in an area where so many different diverse foods
coexisted in the same space. Yeah, she herself was Javanese.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>And then what do we know about her early life?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>She started cooking or learning to cook from her mum at the age of six.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>Her mum was known for her <em>kueh</em>. And her mum also had a Ramadan
food stall. Ramadan is the Muslim fasting month, and every Ramadan, once
a year, her mum would set up a food stall. So, the whole area of Bussorah
street, where people lived would have makeshift stalls in front of their
homes. So, each family would have a food stall in front, just to sell food.
After her mother passed away – I’m not sure what year – she took over the
business, but as early as like six years old.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>She was already helping her mother?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>She was already helping her mother make the <em>kueh</em>, helping her
run the business and things like that. And at the age of 10, she was a
teacher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>So, she went to Rochor Malay Girls School, which was not far from her
house, her home in Bussorah Street, where she learned the art <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">of embroidery and flower arrangement</a>.
At that time, education for girls was very short. So, after Standard Four,
you’re done with school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Standard Four is approximately…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>Primary Four, maybe five. Yeah. So, for a girl at that time, there weren’t
a lot of options – so she became a teacher after she graduated at the age
of 10?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>That’s crazy, right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>Imagine being a teacher when you’re 10. So, she struggled. She struggled
really hard at the start, and she would have to have her other teachers
help her, because her students were only a year younger than her and she
was only 10. But despite being so young, she found love for teaching.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>She must have been very special to become a teacher, to be asked to help
teach at just the age of 10, right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>Yeah, possibly. She was invited to teach because of her skills in embroidery
and flower management. But not every student is…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Cut out to be a teacher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Especially at the age of 10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>So, possibly she was invited to teach and she was a natural teacher who
would go on for the rest of her life teaching in different avenues and
platforms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>That’s amazing. The cookbook was published, I think, in 1986. How well
was it received?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>It was the first all-Malay cookbook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>What does an all-Malay cookbook mean?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>So Times Books International, the publisher, had by that time been publishing
cookbooks by different writers about <a href="https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=1138ea9d-9dbe-4f09-9fef-ba2c7105eb91" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Straits Chinese</u></a> cuisine,
Singapore cuisine, Malaysia cuisine and it was all published in Singapore,
in English. Of course, you had publications in Malaysia that were published
in Malaysia, in Malay, but in Singapore, hers was the first all-Malay cookbook
and also the first cookbook that focused on just Malay cuisine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And by writing that book, I think it was significant, because it put her
in the company of people like Terry Tan, who had by then written books
that were very successful. Betty Yu also. Wendy Hutton, who wrote a few
books about Singapore food, and also Mrs Leong Yi Su, who was known for
her Peranakan cuisine. So, she was the first Malay person, personality,
and also the first Malay cookbook to be added to the arsenal of, like,
the collection of Times Books.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Do you know why Cikgu Asfiah decided to put this cookbook together? What
did she talk about in a foreword or something?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>She truly believed in documenting or capturing traditions and putting
them into books for future generations. And she was very specific about
it being hard cover. There was an interview after her book was published,
in which during the interview, as reported by the journalists, she was
very sad and she was teary-eyed and she recalled about, you know, “I’ve
seen many of my students who would go on to become their own cooking teacher,
or <em>mak andam</em>, and they tried to disseminate recipes in this very
like flimsy cyclo-style booklet.” I’m not sure what cyclo-style is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Okay, thanks for making me feel old, Toffa.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>It’s an older version of printing, right? They’re not very durable, so
she really wanted a hardcover book that would, in her mind, last for generations.
She had this idea since like the 70s to have books published about not
just cooking, right. About traditional makeup, you know, the Malay way
of doing your face, of making yourself beautiful is different from the
way, let’s say, Western style of doing makeup and things like that. And
she was also particular about needing to document Malay handicrafts, how
to make them, the different types of Malay handicrafts, and she wanted
them documented and captured into books.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Things really fell into place for her at the end, towards the end of her
life because it was only a year after she produced her book that she passed
away. But in 1985 there was this interview that was conducted by this writer,
<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Margaret Sullivan, who wrote the book</a><em><a href="https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/redir/itemdetails?bid=8744384" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">“Can Survive Lah” Cottage Industries in High-rise Singapore</a></em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, Margaret’s aim was to document the cottage industries of Singapore,
like yoghurt making. <em>Kueh</em> making. And hence she interviewed Cikgu
Asfiah for that portion on <em>kueh</em> making. And from that feature in
her book, that was how Times Books came to know about her and approached
her to make a book together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Yeah. That’s fantastic. Yeah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>Cikgu Asfiah’s cookbook came out a year later. So, it took a year of testing
the recipes and writing. It must have been such a crazy time for her to
produce a book in one year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Do you know what impact the book has had in the Malay cooking world?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>So, one of the articles in the newspapers mentioned that if her book did
well, it would be translated into English. But as far as I know, the book
was never translated. So perhaps the reach was only within the Malay community
and it never caught on outside the Malay community. Even though the <em>Straits Times</em> had
a couple articles about her and the importance of having this Malay woman
documenting these Malay dishes that were very traditional and on the verge
of disappearing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I have to say, you know, if it didn’t make it outside the Malay community,
maybe her reach wasn’t far enough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Do we know if her reach extended into the Malay community to sell enough
to people there?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>There were advertisements about her book until 1991, at least I found
advertisements up to 1991. In a way because she passed on one year after
her book was released, more could have been done if she had lived longer,
more promotion about the book, more public appearances could have been
done. Because she did appear on the radio after her book and things like
that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>She was also a <em>mak andam</em>. Was she like, well known as a <em>mak andam</em>?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>Yes, she was well known. Very respected. So, she had this regular class.
She was a member of the Persatuan Kebudayaan Melayu Singapura, which is
the Society of Malay Culture Singapore. She was also an executive committee
member, elected as vice chairperson, and she would later be a founding
member of the women’s wing of the Malay Society. And it is with this Malay
society that she had this regular class on Malay handicrafts. And as part
of the training, the students also had to learn some aspects of being a <em>mak andam</em> or
at least the customs and traditions related to the work of a <em>mak andam</em>,
which includes doing hairdressing in traditional style, doing traditional
makeup and things like that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>The people taking these classes are the people who wanted to be <em>mak andam</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>She did have students who would later follow in her footsteps, you know.
So, she managed to inspire or empower certain groups or women to take on
this vocation as a <em>mak andam</em>. But her students were mainly housewives,
and she was also trying to attract the younger crowd, because she was very
big on passing what she called the knowledge of the old people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>That’s what she called it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>Yes. <em>Kesenian orang lama</em> or veteran, not old people, but more like… <em>Orang lama</em> in
Malay would translate to literally “old people” or “people of the past”.
Yeah. And she was very big about continuing the legacy of mothers, and
I think she had a lot of respect for her own mum and she learned so much
from her mum, who passed down so much to her that she wanted to pass on
what she had learned herself to the younger generation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>And she also passed it down to her own children, right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>Yes. So, her own children helped her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>So, tell me about her children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>So, she had eight children? Yeah, and many grandchildren. But her children
were very involved in her work as a <em>mak andam</em>, as a teacher and
things like that. So, she had the help of her family members. especially
her daughters. Salama Bashorun, I think, is her first daughter and her
son Kairul. I believe that’s his name and her grandson, Azrin. And these
were the people who helped her so much to write the book because she tried
to enlist the help of members of the community, of the associations, the
cultural association she was part of.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She had difficulties concentrating on writing, because she was writing
the book in her 60s. Maybe she was tired and things like that. And she
was also, I think, having some kind of illness. But thankfully, her family
members…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Pitched in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>Pitched in, yeah. And that’s why she dedicated the book to her family.
Yeah. And her children were also heavily involved, especially her daughters,
in the running of the Ramadan food stall, because her stall was huge and
they sold such a wide variety of <em>kueh</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Ah okay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>I think, 50 types of <em>kueh</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Fifty types of <em>kueh</em>!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>Yeah. So, I mean she was known for certain types of <em>kueh</em>, but
the diversity – and if you were a customer you would be spoiled for choice
basically. Yeah. So, they helped make the <em>kueh</em>, run the stall and
things like that. And her daughter Salamah was also someone who helped
her run her classes. So, she would run classes about Malay handicrafts,
about embroidery and needlework.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And her daughter actually opened a shop in Eunos in the late 80s, I believe,
or 80s, selling Malay handicrafts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>The daughter definitely went on to carry on her mother’s legacy. Yeah.
So, you’ve talked about her being a <em>mak andam</em> and, you know, all
the classes that she conducted as well. But for the people who don’t really
know what a <em>mak andam</em> does, and among those people would include
me, what is the job of a <em>mak andam</em>?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>So, a <em>mak andam</em>, or I mean, in English, we would call her a wedding
attendant, has a very, very important role in the whole process before,
during, and after a wedding. So, she’s in today’s context sometimes, you
know, the <em>mak andam</em>’s work deals mainly with beautifying the bride,
making up her face, putting on the heavy accessories on her head, helping
her put on the clothes and choosing the clothes for her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But in the past, the <em>mak andam</em>’s job was much, much wider than
that. She would be involved in this thing called the <em>andam</em> ceremony,
which is where the name comes from. So the <em>andam </em>ceremony in traditional
Malay customs is when the <em>mak andam</em> would basically remove the baby
hairs – the tiny, tiny hairs – on the forehead of the bride. It is believed
that if you remove and clean the forehead and all of those tiny hairs,
it would increase the <em>seri muka</em> or <em>seri waja</em> of the bride,
which is the visage, you know, giving her a glow in her subsequent role
as a bride.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yeah. And the <em>mak andam</em> was also involved in guiding the bride
and groom about certain things to do like the customs of <em>berinai</em>,
where you put henna on your head before the wedding day. Yeah. So traditionally
different groups of Malay communities would practice it differently. There’s
a version where you practice three nights of <em>berinai</em>. Three nights
of putting on the henna and not all nights would involve the groom, but
all nights involve the bride. During the wedding the <em>mak andam</em> will
lead the couple in giving their first taste of food, like you would feed
the fruit to each other and things like that. And, also, after the wedding
sometimes, this custom about the <em>mandi bunga</em>, or the bridal shower,
like literally a shower of water. Yeah. So, all these different customs,
the <em>mak andam</em> has to know every single custom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>So the <em>mak andam</em> has to be like this font of culture and tradition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>Yes. Yeah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>But today maybe it’s not as elaborate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>Yeah. So the <em>mak andam</em> is also like, you know the person who gives
the bride away to the groom? Because in traditional Malay custom, it’s
kind of like what we call the gatecrashing, right? You have to pay money
to access the bride somehow, but in Malay custom when the groom comes and
if he wants to go to the bride, the <em>mak andam</em> is the person who’s
like, wait a minute, we need to exchange some <em>pantuns</em>. I’m not
sure even today, sometimes people use money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Last time use <em>pantuns</em>. They were more educated, <em>lah</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, certain parts of the Malay world still practice this, right?
But in Singapore some people still do. But you know the art of saying the <em>pantun</em>,
you know, in a live setting and just exchanging <em>pantun</em> on the spot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>So, it’s not like rehearsed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>Maybe you can come prepared with one stanza, right? You’re just like riffing
off each other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Yeah. It’s like a rap battle, <em>pantun</em> style.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>It’s like a rap battle. Yeah. You never know because some people are truly
talented. Yeah. So, a <em>mak andam</em> has to know and be able to come
up with <em>pantuns</em> and to <em>balas</em> the <em>pantun</em>, which is
to reply to the <em>pantun</em> given by the groom’s party. Yeah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>I’m really impressed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>Oh, and interestingly, she was the <em>mak andam</em> of Harun Aminurrashid’s
daughter. So, if you remember in the past podcast right, I spoke about
<a href="https://biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg/podcast/belacan/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Siti Radiah</a>, who was a cookbook author in the 50s and 60s. So, her
daughter for her marriage had Cikgu Asfiah as her <em>mak andam</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>That’s such an amazing link!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>It’s a small world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>It is indeed a small world. Was it easy to research about Cikgu Asfiah?
Was there a lot written about her?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>Thankfully, there was quite a lot of coverage in the newspapers. Even
before her cookbook, right, she was already a well-known figure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Ah okay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>So, it’s not just the coverage on her cookbook and her finally writing
the cookbook, but because of her involvement in the Malay associations,
cultural bodies like, like the Malay Society, and there was also another
one, Majlis Pusat Pertubuhan-Pertubuhan Budaya Melayu, in short, the Central
Council of Malay Cultural Organisations. So, she was very involved in the
works of these two associations and the activities of these associations
were very well reported in <em>Berita Harian</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>So you were able to find lots of references to her in, I guess like NewspaperSG
or something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>Yes. NewspaperSG is actually our database by the National Library where
we digitise newspapers, including <em>Berita Harian</em>, from many, many
years ago. So yeah, that was one of the important resources I had to tap
on to find information about her. Yeah, but of course, you had books like
Margaret Sullivan’s book, which was wonderful in giving us an introduction
to her legacy in Kampong Glam as a <em>kueh</em> maker and as a Ramadan food
stall vendor. She was involved in the curation of a display or exhibition
about Malay culture organised by the Majlis Pusat or the Central Council
of Malay Cultural Organisations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, they held this thing called the Pesta Budaya Melayu, or Malay Cultural
Festival in 81. I believe it was 1981, and she was invited to help, you
know, give her input and also loan her personal collection of handiwork
and handicraft to the exhibition about Malay handicrafts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>At this point, however, in the interview I’d like to turn away from focusing
only on Cikgu Asfiah, and to talk about other things, like, for example,
you’ve written about <em>belachan</em>, you’ve written about Siti Radiah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why is food history important to you? And why is it important?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>Food itself is a lens through which you can understand history, right?
And food can inform you about the evolution of culture, about women’s activities,
about trade and commerce and things like that. So, I’m mainly interested
in the lives and the stories of women. One avenue is to look at who wrote
the cookbooks and why they wrote it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So that’s how I decided to write about Siti Radiah in the past, and also
about Cikgu Asfiah now. Because in the larger scheme of things, right,
when we think about culture, usually there’s a focus on like literature,
focus on dance, drama, but the culinary arts as a form of cultural practice
has not been, in my opinion, been researched enough in Singapore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, also, who are the drivers of these cultural changes? Who were the
writers? Who were the people really trying to document recipes and traditions?
As a librarian, I have access to these materials, so why not just, you
know, explore and try to write a biography of these women, the best that
I can with the information I have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, that leads us to our next question. What are you going to
work on next?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>I have no idea. I haven’t decided yet. Possibly about cookbooks, too,
but whether it’s focused on a personality, I don’t know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>We’re all waiting to see what else you’re going to work on. Complete the
sentence. Food is…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>Dynamic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Okay. What do you mean?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>Food is never static. It’s always changing. You know, that’s why, you
know, Cikgu Asfiah felt this huge responsibility to serve a community by
documenting recipes because she saw that a lot of them were dying out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Actually, you’ve raised a really good point, right? Because actually the <em>bunga kobis</em>,
if she hadn’t written about that written that recipe, you wouldn’t have
known about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>Exactly. Because the <em>bunga kobis</em> today in Malay weddings is gone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Completely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>Completely. And the <em>hantaran</em> that you see in the photos of perhaps
your parents’ generation, the 70s, 80s and even the <em>hantaran</em> in
the 90s is different from the <em>hantaran</em> you get today. Like for example
from my own wedding right, last year, we didn’t have <em>bunga kobis</em>,
because it’s fallen out of trend. We did exchange electronic devices, which
people didn’t do in the past, apart from maybe like a Rolex watch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We had like a Nintendo Switch gaming console and things like that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>Was it your <em>hantaran</em> to your husband or your husband to you?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>My husband to me, yeah. I didn’t give him something similar, like a PlayStation
or something. But, you know, for us to share anyway. So food is dynamic,
if Cikgu Asfiah hadn’t documented this dish and made it the cover as well
right, I wouldn’t have known, and my mum has forgotten that <em>bunga kobis</em> was
one of the <em>hantaran</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
</p>
<p>At her wedding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toffa</strong>
</p>
<p>At her wedding. Yeah. So, I think it’s important to look at the sources,
newspaper sources of course, but also speak to people who are still alive
and who are cultural practitioners. Like, you know, my aunt who was a <em>mak andam</em>.
To get the stories. And they themselves can tell you how food has evolved
and changed over time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
