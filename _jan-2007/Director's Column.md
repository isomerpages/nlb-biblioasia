History is not just about personalities but also about their
deeds, their contributions and their culture. A mix of history
and cultures forms essential components of Singapore past
and present. This provides a varied look at Singapore culture
from all angles, from individual personalities and entire groups
to their practices and writings. The pioneers of Singapore have
together moulded and influenced Singapore local culture.

In this issue, we celebrate two of our pioneers: Dr Lim Boon
Keng and N Palanivelu, both of whom in their own ways
have contributed much to the progress of Singapore. Dr
Lim was a great advocate for Chinese education. He also
played an instrumental role in the survival and growth of
early immigrant Chinese even during the Japanese
Occupation. 2007 marks the 50th anniversary of Dr Lim
Boon Keng's death and at the start of this new year, the
Library commemorates this important man in Singapore's
history with an exhibition, "Lim Boon Keng: A Life to
Remember" on the life and times of Dr Lim. A series of
related programmes will be held in conjunction with the
exhibition, including a musical performance put together
by Stella Kon, the great-granddaughter of Dr Lim, a special
heritage bus tour to places related to Dr Lim Boon Keng,
and a conference. More information can be found at <a href="https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/home">https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/home</a>

Mr N Palanivelu, a novelist, playwright and poet, contributed
much to the Singapore Tamil literary scene. Mr N Palanivelu
had been an active writer for more than 50 years and wrote
some 50 stories over a period of 25 years. He also staged
plays on the themes of social reform. Winner of several
awards, including the prestigious Cultural Medallion for
Drama in 1986, Mr N Palanivelu is featured in this issue
and is also one of the authors highlighted in the Singapore
Literary Pioneers Gallery at the National Library.

Besides individuals, ethnic groups also playa part in the
evolution of Singapore's history. One of these groups is
the Peranakan community. Commonly known as Babas,
the Peranakans playa significant role in shaping local culture
with their food, beadwork and jewellry. To provide better
access to the materials on Peranakan culture and history, a resource guide, *A Baba Bibliography*, with more than 1,500
annotated citations of books, chapters in books, magazine
and newspaper articles, websites and audiovisual materials
on the subject, will be published in the coming months.
These materials span a period of almost 200 years of writing,
from the early 19th century to the 21 st century. An article
in this issue discusses this in detail.

To assist you in getting a deeper insight into the lives of our
pioneers, I am pleased to say that you can consult reference
sources authored by pioneers available at the National Library.
One item is *Chinese Crisis from Within*, articles on the political
situation of China written by Dr Lim Boon Keng. Another is
*One Hundred Years' History of the Chinese in Singapore*, which
is also available online in the Digital Library. Written by Mr
Song Ong Siang, a prominent Straits Chinese leader in 1923,
the title is an authoritative source on the Chinese community
in Singapore then. You can also find other books written
about the pioneers of Singapore; some of them though, may
only discuss a particular pioneer. To help you with your
reference and research, the National Library has compiled
and published a bibliography, *Prominent Singaporeans: Sources
of Information*, to guide you in locating relevant materials
more effectively. The research guide is available in the Digital
Library (<a href="https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/home">https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/home</a>) located under "e-Resources,
e-Collections" .

In addition to the above, there are other programmes and
exhibitions organised by the National Library in the coming
months. I would like to encourage you to sign up for the
programmes at <a href="https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/home">https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/home</a>. We look forward
to seeing you at the Library, and happy reading!
