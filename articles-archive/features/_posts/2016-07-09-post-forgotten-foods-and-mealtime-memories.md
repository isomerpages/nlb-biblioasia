#### Food writer **Sylvia Tan** remembers the foods and flavours she grew up with and the less than sanitary practices made for stomachs cast in iron.

What could be more off-putting than dipping sticks of charcoal-grilled satay into a communal pot of peanut gravy at a roadside stall literally metres away from belching buses?

Yet I recall that time with sweet nostalgia, quite forgetting the lung-clogging smoke from the buses that ended their journey at the Tay Koh Yat depot along Beach Road, or worse, dipping a half-eaten stick of satay or cube of *ketupat* (rice cake) into the communal pot shared with goodness knows how many others who’d just done the same.

Just as no one bothered if the ice ball man, now long gone, had washed his hands before manhandling and shaping shaven ice into balls for us to lick and suck into. All that concerned us was how generous he was with the multi-coloured syrups he drizzled over these ice balls, finished off with swirls of creamy evaporated milk. What could be more refreshing than icy sweetness crowned by milky creaminess? You could even share the ice ball if you didn’t have enough money, for he’d cut it into half, enough for two.

Today, you cannot buy ice balls for love or money, although satay is widely available, albeit no longer served the old-fashioned way. Today, most hawker dishes, no matter their origins, are served in the same cookie-cutter style using disposable crockery and cutlery.

Time was when you didn’t even have to call out your order of satay. Instead, you’d just find a seat and the satay man would grill an assortment of bamboo sticks, threaded with chicken, beef or mutton, which he placed on a communal platter for you to help yourself to. You shared a table with strangers, sitting companionably side by side on low stools. And you paid only for the sticks you took, with the satay man counting the sticks left behind by your plate to tote up your bill. Everyone happily dipped into the same pot of gravy – germs and parasites be damned!

At the old People’s Park in Chinatown in the 1950s – a collection of tumbledown stalls and lean-tos before it was destroyed by fire in 1966 – you could find Chinese food skewered on sticks. This Cantonese street food called lok mei is still available on the streets of Hong Kong but not in sanitary Singapore anymore.

Plates were not necessary at the lok mei pushcart. Instead you picked from the various skewers threaded with virulently coloured morsels of cooked octopus, cuttlefish, chicken wings, pork belly, pig’s ears and other innards. You paid for the sticks you chose and dipped them into tins – again communal – filled with various sauces and condiments such as chilli and hoisin sauce (made from soybeans and garlic) among others, laid out in front of the stall before you went away, happily munching on this takeaway delight.

#### **Home Delivery, Singapore Style**

This was a time of mobile food – when hawking was still allowed on the streets – served by pushcart hawkers who’d set up shop at dedicated street corners, completely exposed to the elements. Equally common were itinerant hawkers who made their daily rounds, carting their foods past your doorstep and calling out for customers.

Growing up in post-Independent Singapore in the 1960s, I remember spending lunchtime after school perched on my mother’s stone bench outside the gates of our house at the end of a narrow unpaved lorong (road) in Ponggol, waiting for the konlo mee man to pass. Konlo mee is Cantonese dry noodles as we still know it today, dressed with a chilli sauce, garnished with a few slices of char siew (barbequed pork) and perhaps two or three plump wanton, meat dumplings filled with minced pork and scented with sesame oil.

But unlike today’s hawkers, this noodle seller would cry out his wares, in between clacking a set of wooden paddles, which he and other tok-tok men, as they were called, used to announce their arrival in the neighbourhood. The cry of the konlo mee seller was just one of the myriad ways in which hawkers used to jostle for attention in the past.

The ting-ting man who used to peddle his tray of rock candy too is no more: he’d use a small hammer and chisel to break into the hard white candy, the resulting high-pitched clatter of metal against metal giving the name ting-ting. Also long gone is the Indian tikam-tikam man tooting the horn of his small van, a treasure trove of bits and bobs as well as fairground goodies such as candy floss and a shocking pink sweet wafer disc sold from large tins, for which you gambled or played *tikam-tikam* (Malay for “game of chance”) with the vendor.

Meanwhile the lor ap or braised duck man would cry out “lor ap” in a long nasal cry, carrying his soy-braised ducks, a Teochew speciality, as well as his wooden chopping block, in baskets balanced on a pole across his shoulders. He would chop up the duck as you liked it. You could even ask for just one drumstick, as my grandmother would do, sinking her teeth into its unctuous flesh without waiting for it to be cut up first. Or you could ask for braised innards and duck webs, which modern lor ap sellers of today are unlikely to purvey.

Hawkers today would not dream of pounding the streets in search of customers, lugging their wares on their shoulders as the lor ap man of old did daily. Government restrictions on food handling have put paid to such unsanitary practices. Using just one pail of water to wash dirty crockery throughout the day would not have been tolerated today.

#### **Food on the Go – Literally**

I remember these hawkers with fondness for they offered an amazing variety of foods. You could count among this foot army of food sellers the Indian kacang puteh man, who sold a variety of roasted and boiled nuts on a tray balanced precariously on his head, and the putu mayam man who also carried his lacy white rice flour pancakes, eaten with bright orange sugar and shredded coconut, in a basket balanced on his head.

When public housing came into the picture, the nasi lemak boy (they were always boys) would carry packets of banana leaf-wrapped rice with spicy sambal, fried fish or omelette in a basket almost as big as himself along the common corridors of the flats. People hearing the sing-song call of “naaa-si lemaaak” of these boys would scurry out of their flats to buy these savoury coconut-rice parcels for breakfast or a mid-morning snack.

In the days before environmentally destructive styrofoam and plastic takeaway containers appeared on the scene, itinerant hawkers would rely on a range of novel food wrappers, including recycled exercise book paper, fresh banana leaves and dried opeh (palm) leaves to hold their roasted nuts, lacy pancakes, rojak or fried noodles.

This mobile food army also thought of ingenious ways of transporting their food: in baskets, on trays (including a folding trestle stand), which they would balance on their heads, in pushcarts and later, on bicycles, tricycles or small vans, equipped with horns to advertise their arrival – no need for vocal cord-shattering cries or clattering implements anymore.
