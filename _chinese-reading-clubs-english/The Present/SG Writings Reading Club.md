**About**:	SG Writings Reading Club, originally founded as the Tea Chapter Reading Club on 18 October 1998, is dedicated to fostering a love of reading and providing a platform for literary discussion and discovery. The club's mission is to encourage regular reading habits, facilitate the exchange of literary insights, explore the essence of great works, enhance members' appreciation abilities, and nurture their inherent artistic sensibilities. Over its more than two-decade history, the club has organised over 200 reading activities, demonstrating its commitment to sustained literary engagement. The club's book selections are diverse, spanning world literary classics, Chinese literature, and local works, alongside titles in philosophy, history, economics, management, travel writing, motivational literature, and biographical works. This breadth ensures that members encounter varied perspectives and genres, enriching their reading experience and broadening their intellectual horizons.
