#### Launch issues can make or break a new publication. **Barbara Quek** shares highlights of first issues from NLB’s Legal Deposit Collection.

Inaugural or first issues of publications – whether lifestyle magazines, trade publications or scholarly journals – are sometimes much anticipated by readers because of the hype and publicity drummed up in the lead-up to their launch.

First issues of famous and iconic magazines, such as *Life* and *National Geographic*, have become highly sought-after collectors’ items, with some titles fetching high prices on eBay. Much time and expense are invested in inaugural issues as they can make or break the publication.

First impressions do count in the publishing business. If the cover is dull, and the contents pedestrian and do not resonate with the intended audience, there is a good chance the publication will not last beyond the first year.

While editors often try and anticipate readers’ tastes when deciding on the contents, some have firm personal convictions about what is right (or wrong) for their readership.1 Editorials – either in the form of a lead article or an introductory note from the editor-in-chief or publisher – are usually worth more than a cursory read.

In the first issue of *The Food Paper* launched in January 1987, its editor, well-known food critic Violet Oon, claimed that her culinary magazine “will excite, titillate and amuse” its readers. Published in a newspaper format, it was pitched as an “affordable” publication for food connoisseurs looking to experience “love at first bite”.2

The editor of literary magazine *Tumasek* had loftier ambitions, asserting that “at the inception of a magazine, it is necessary to promulgate one’s intentions and aspirations…, and it is fitting that the editorial of our first number should be devoted to this end”.3

Published with a discerning audience in mind, the editor of *Folk Scene Singapore* aimed “to present folk music in its fullest spectrum”, adding that if readers “find our interpretation controversial, in which case we shall be pleased, as this magazine intends to be controversial on the subject of music”.4

#### **Pages from the Past**

First-issue publications evoke memories of people, places and events from times past. The tabloid format was the norm for several early student and community-focused publications, including [*The Student Times*](http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding_s.aspx?bid=200085304) (1960), [*Students’ digest illustrated*](http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding_s.aspx?bid=200080195) (1967) and [*Busway*](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=5041547) (1975). There were also relatively more B4-size publications back then, such as [*The Journal of the Singapore Society of Architects*](http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding_s.aspx?bid=200086051) (1923), [*Singapore illustrated Weekly*](http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding_s.aspx?bid=200072778) (1947), [*Her world*](http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding_s.aspx?bid=4184741) (1960), [*V.I.P. magazine: The prestige magazine*](http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding_s.aspx?bid=200085267) (1966), [*The Travellers’ palm*](http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding_s.aspx?bid=200071718) (1967) and [*National pioneer*](http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding_s.aspx?bid=4184732) (1969). Black-and-white pages featured more prominently as colour printing was very costly in those days.

Many of these old magazines have either ceased publication, changed names or acquired new publishers. Sustaining a publication is often more challenging than publishing and launching a new one, and we applaud those that have stood the test of time. Although quite different in contents, style and readership, *National Pioneer*, forerunner of today’s *Pioneer* magazine of the Singapore Armed Forces, and *Her World*, Singapore’s oldest women’s magazine, have survived to this day.

Featured in this essay are just a sampling of titles from a collection of about 700 first-issue publications – from 1923 to 1987 – available in the Legal Deposit Collection of the National Library, Singapore. The titles run the gamut from light-hearted fare, such as fashion, entertainment, art, music, sports and food, to more serious reading like architecture, building and construction, business and education.
