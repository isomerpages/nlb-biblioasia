Singapore has never hesitated to roll out the red carpet for visiting dignitaries, and this is exactly what a British royal experienced when he sailed into Singapore nearly 150 years ago.

In December 1869, Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh and Queen Victoria’s second son, paid a visit to Singapore on the *HMS Galatea*.[^1] As his tour marked the first time a member of the British royal family was to set foot in Malaya,[^2] officials and merchants scrambled to prepare for his arrival with a suitably grand programme of entertainment.[^3]

The Chinese community in particular was anxious not to be outdone. More than 80 leading members of the upper crust of Chinese society came together to sign a Loyalty Address to Prince Alfred, taking advantage of the opportunity to showcase the community’s prosperity and display their political allegiance to the Queen.[^4] Among the group were men who were considered as the colony’s leading lights of industry: Tan Kim Ching, the eldest son of Tan Tock Seng; Seah Eu Chin, who helped set up Ngee Ann Kongsi; businessman and philanthropist Cheang Hong Lim; Tan Seng Poh, the first Chinese person appointed as a Municipal Commissioner in Singapore; and Hoo Ah Kay (Whampoa), a wealthy businessman.[^5]

On 3 December 1869, the very day the prince landed in Singapore, likely at Johnston’s Pier near Fullerton Square, the Loyalty Address – dated 25 November 1869 – was presented to him as a symbol of the Straits Chinese community’s loyalty and gratitude.[^6]

The Address is suitably grand for a royal recipient, with the message written on six panels of fuchsia-coloured silk, folded into a single sheet and with front and back covers made of carved wood. Phoenixes were carved into the wooden panels such that when the document is opened they appear to be facing each other across the expanse of silk. The reverse side of the Address is a panorama of Singapore viewed from Telok Ayer, executed on cream-coloured silk and inspired by an oil painting by the English artist Percy Carpenter (1820-95).
