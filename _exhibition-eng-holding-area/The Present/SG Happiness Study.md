**About**:	We are founded upon the transformative belief that happiness is not merely a fleeting emotional state but rather a cultivatable skill. 
Our approach centres on The Harvardâ€™s Study on Happiness, which provides a scientific foundation for understanding the mechanisms of human flourishing. We integrate these evidence-based insights with broader psychological principles and timeless life wisdom. Through our community of practice, we accompany one another on journeys of personal growth and heightened awareness, utilising reading, meaningful exchange, and deliberate practice as our primary tools for transformation. We discover strength and resilience through our engagement with carefully selected literature, whilst finding healing and comfort through the genuine companionship that emerges from shared vulnerability and mutual support. By reading together, sharing our discoveries and challenges, and actively practising happiness-enhancing behaviours, we create a nurturing environment where each member can develop into a more compassionate, resilient, and genuinely warm human being.
