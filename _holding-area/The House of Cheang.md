#### **The Cheangs were once one of Singapore’s most illustrious Baba-Nonya families.**
By Professor Walter Woon

On Pasir Panjang Road stands one of the last grand houses that used to line the millionaires’ enclave where rich Baba families built their seaside mansions. Once named “Palm Beach”, the property is a reminder of the opulence that once characterised the prominent Baba-Nonya (or Peranakan) families of Singapore.[^1] The house was built by Cheang Jim Chuan, a scion of the prominent Cheang family in colonial Singapore. Cheang Jim Chuan’s father was the most famous of the Cheangs – Cheang Hong Lim, after whom Hong Lim Park is named. At one time a substantial part of Chinatown was owned by Cheang Hong Lim and his relatives.

#### **Cheang Sam Teo and the Opium Farm**

According to family tradition, Cheang Hong Lim’s father, Cheang Sam Teo (d. 1862), left Teang Thye Village in Fukien Province, China, around 1820. He may have first gone to Batavia (now Jakarta) in the Netherlands East Indies, where migrants from Teang Thye had established a temple.[^2] Cheang Sam Teo, together with Tay Han Long (father of Tay Ho Swee), had a business at Telok Ayer Street under the chop Teang Wat.[^3] Cheang Sam Teo made his fortune trading in the Nanyang, and, by the 1840s, had become the Opium Farmer in Singapore.[^4]

At the time, the sale of opium was both legal in the Straits Settlements and encouraged by the British East India Company. The right to distribute opium within a territory was auctioned to the highest bidder. This was the so-called opium farm. The opium farmer had an exclusive license to distribute opium in return for a fee paid to the government. There were other types of revenue farms (such as gambier, spirits, toddy and pork), but the fees from the opium farm made up the bulk of the income of the Straits government.[^5]

Although the opium farm was ostensibly awarded to a named individual, in reality he represented a syndicate, or _kongsi_.[^6] No doubt the arrangements among the members of the syndicate would have been governed by Chinese principles; but the commercial law of the Straits Settlements was entirely English.[^7]&nbsp; In legal terms, this would have been a partnership. The farm would have had to have been held by a named individual as the concept of a company with a legal personality[^8] was not established until the latter part of the 19th century.

The opium farm was mostly controlled by syndicates of merchants from a particular Chinese province. The different Chinese dialect groups formed self-help societies (such as clan associations) to aid migrants from the same province. These self-help societies, contrary to popular belief today, were neither illegal nor criminal.[^9]

There was stiff competition and constant commercial rivalry between syndicates for the opium farm. When one syndicate obtained the farm, their rivals would try to break their monopoly by smuggling opium into the territory. This was not a crime as we know it today. Back then, there was no developed means of enforcing the monopoly against outsiders through a lawsuit for damages as one would do today. Instead, the opium farmer protected the syndicate’s rights through private prosecutions; fines were levied which were shared between the prosecutor and the government.&nbsp; This was the way that private individuals obtained redress in contemporary England. The syndicates also employed revenue officers known as _chinteng_[^10] to police their monopolies; these men were often from the same community as the leading members of the _kongsi_ and did not always deal with infringements gently.

In Singapore, there was hostility between the Hokkiens and Teochews, which resulted in riots on several occasions. Later in the 19th century, colonial authorities designated some of the more violent elements of the clan and provincial associations as criminal “secret societies”.[^11]&nbsp;However, self-help communities remained an essential part of Chinese commercial life in the Straits Settlements, despite the abuses perpetrated by some of their members.

In the 1840s, Cheang Sam Teo and some other merchants formed a syndicate to acquire the opium farm and spirit farm (the two often were held by the same merchants). At the time of his death in 1862, Cheang Sam Teo was the spirit farmer in Singapore. His son Cheang Hong Lim became the spirit farmer the next year, presumably in partnership with others since legally his “share” in the syndicate could not be inherited. He was barely 21 at the time. Eventually, Cheang Hong Lim became a leading member of the Great Syndicate that held the opium and spirit farms for Singapore, Johore, Malacca and Rhio from 1871 to 1879.[^12]

#### **Cheang Hong Lim**

Cheang Hong Lim (1841–93) was one of the great philanthropists of Singapore and is commemorated by two streets in Singapore: Cheang Hong Lim Place and Cheang Wan Seng Place (Cheang Hong Lim’s business was conducted under the name Chop Wan Seng).[^13]

Besides being the farmer for opium and spirits, he also owned extensive tracts of land in Chinatown and was a “large house-property owner” particularly along Havelock Road. In 1876, he contributed funds to convert the empty land in front of the then-Police Courts into a public garden.[^14] This still bears his name today as Hong Lim Park.&nbsp; He also owned Hong Lim Market and would advance money liberally to stallholders. According to Song Ong Siang in _100 Years’ History of the Chinese in Singapore,_ “\[Cheang Hong Lim\] was a man who trusted too readily to other people’s honesty”.&nbsp; When he died, it was discovered that the enormous sum of over $400,000 had been lent to “friends” and could not be recovered.[^15]
