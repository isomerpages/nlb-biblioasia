The National Library of Singapore is the custodian of Singapore’s published heritage. One of the statutory functions mandated by the National Library Board Act is the Legal Deposit, which empowers the National Library to collect published works by writers and publishers in Singapore. Under the act, publishers are required by law to deposit two copies of every work published in Singapore – within four weeks of its publication – with the National Library. 

The Legal Deposit is not a new concept: it is an important function of national libraries all over the world. Legal Deposit helps build the national collection by ensuring that the country’s published heritage is systematically collected and preserved for posterity.

A secondary role is making the collection accessible to the public. Given the ephemeral nature of information in the Internet age, Legal Deposit is especially important as it is an archived collection and preservation system for Singapore’s print heritage, and in time to come, electronic and web content.

#### **History of Legal Deposit in Singapore**

The European origins of Legal Deposit can be traced to the Ordonnance de Montpellier (Ordinance of Montpellier) signed by King Francois I of France on 28 December 1537, when it was first 
applied as a mechanism to control and censor dissenting theologies. This legal instrument was expanded in the 16th century in order to build a national collection in France; it was subsequently adopted by several European countries such as 
Germany and Britain.

In Singapore, the Legal Deposit function has its roots in the British government’s Indian Act XI of 1835, which required printers and publishers to conform to rules governing public information. 
With the passing of the Book Registration Ordinance of 1886, the Raffles Library and Museum became the designated Legal Deposit library for all books published in the Straits Settlements 
(Singapore, Malacca and Penang). 

The enactment of the Raffles National Library Ordinance, which came into force on 1 April 1958, marked an important milestone in 
the history of the National Library. The ordinance mandated the National Library as the depository library for all materials published and printed in Singapore, a function that was continued 
under the Printers and Publishers Act in 1970 and subsequently under the National Library Board Act in 1995.

#### **Legal Deposit Today**

With the support of local publishers and writers, the National Library has been able to build up a robust Legal Deposit Collection comprising more than a million items over the years. 

The collection provides a comprehensive picture of the local publishing scene, featuring materials that span across subjects ranging from the arts, culture and entertainment to politics, economics and science. The collection also includes an assortment of non-print formats – reflecting how technology has evolved over time – such as cassette tapes, video cassettes, floppy disks and compact discs as well as electronic publications 
in PDF, JPEG and MP3 formats.

The National Library also serves as the Singapore agency for issuing the International Standard Book Number (ISBN), International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) and International 
Standard Music Number (ISMN). These International Standard Numbers can be likened to a publication’s fingerprint, an international code that helps publishers, suppliers and libraries locate, order and track published material.

Additionally, the Legal Deposit function also covers materials that have not been assigned International Standard Numbers. Under the National Library Board Act, the National Library is mandated by law to collect local publications without international standard numbers, but have been made available for public distribution. These include school magazines, publications from clans and associations, company annual reports, conference papers and proceedings, posters and even theatre programmes and exhibition catalogues. 

The Legal Deposit Collections aims to provide researchers with a rich repository of primary and secondary research materials to 
draw on, and to also provide an accurate and complete picture of the printing and publishing sector in Singapore. All these could not have been possible without the support of the local publishing fraternity.

It is important to note that the Legal Deposit Collection is not an exclusive collection. While some of the publications deposited with Legal Deposit – in line with the National Library Board’s aim to provide interesting and useful publications to the public – are available for reference at the National Library’s Lee Kong Chian Reference Library, the board also purchases copies of selected titles for its 26 branches of the Public Libraries.

#### **The Next Leap for Legal Deposit**

In the Internet age, many libraries in the world have revised their Legal Deposit legislation to include the mandatory submission of electronic publications and web content. Countries that have extended the scope of their legal deposit framework include the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, France, Denmark, Finland, Japan and Korea. 

Although the National Library Board Act of Singapore has yet to make the deposit of electronic publications and web content mandatory, publishers and producers of such content are strongly encouraged to deposit their electronic materials with the National Library for preservation. To date, the National Library has received more than 1,000 electronic publications deposited voluntarily by publishers. The full text of these materials is available for onsite access via the dedicated BookSG terminal on level 11 of the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library at the National Library Building.

Selected highlights of the Legal Deposit Collection are currently on display at level 11 of the National Library Building until 29 February 2016.
