description: Many people know of the story of Badang the strongman, an
  aboriginal slave who gains supernatural strength after eating the vomit of a
  spirit. He throws a stone, which might or might not be the Singapore Stone,
  and his miracle-working grave is believed to be on Pulau Buru in the Riau
  Archipelago. However, independent scholar William Gibson tells us the tale of
  Badang (and the location of his grave) is much more complicated than is
  generally known.
