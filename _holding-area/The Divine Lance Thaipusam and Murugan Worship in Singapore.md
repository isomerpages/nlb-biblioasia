On 9 February 1952, the Singapore Free Press carried a story titled “No ‘Kavadis’ Today”. That year, Singapore’s Tamil community scaled down Thaipusam celebrations and refrained from holding the procession because of the death of King George VI. That was an unprecedented event. Since then, there hasn’t been such another instance of Thaipusam being put on hold, that is, until 2021 when the procession in Singapore was disallowed because of the Covid-19 pandemic. 

Thaipusam personifies the worship of Murugan, a celebrated patron god in Tamil tradition who has been revered for over two millennia. Taking place during Thai, the 10th month in the Tamil calendar (January to February in the Gregorian calendar), Thaipusam is celebrated in South India, and outside it, by the Tamil diaspora in Singapore, Malaysia, Mauritius, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Myanmar and even Australia.

In Singapore, the festival is one of the most distinguishing features of diasporic Hindu practice and one of the earliest public Hindu festivals. Worshippers, including carriers of milk pots and kavadi, exemplify their devotion to Murugan in an annual 4-kilometre foot procession. The festival is a reflection of a journey that spans over 160 years, growing beyond its orthodoxy, in cross-cultural Singapore.

#### **The God with a Lance**

மாயோன் மேய காடுறை உலகமும்
சேயோன் மேய மைவரை உலகமும்
வேந்தன் மேய தீம்புனல் உலகமும்
வருணன் மேய பெருமணல் உலகமும்
முல்லை குறிஞ்சி மருதம் நெய்தல் எனச்
சொல்லிய முறையான் சொல்லவும் படுமே

the pastoral region, presided over by Mayon; 
the mountain region, presided over by Ceyon; 
the riverine region, presided over by Ventan; 
the great sandy (coastal) region, presided over by Varunan; 
these, in the order enumerated, are called *mullai, kurinci, marutam and neytal.*

-*Tolkappiyam*, 951 

Thaipusam is centred around the worship of Murugan. The boy god Murugan’s identity is a complex mix of several inseparable historical and cultural roots, and a reflection of the inherent complexity of Tamil tradition. Tamil poetry of the Sangam era (a period spanning roughly 3rd century BCE to 3rd century CE) positions Murugan (or Murukan from the word muruku meaning “beautiful”, “fragrant” or “youthful one”) as the god of the hills and hunt, and the son of Korravai, goddess of war and victory. 

Murugan was a name originally given to the god of the hilly region Kurinci. In the Tolkappiyam, the oldest extant Tamil grammatical text, he is described as Ceyon or the red one due to the association of the ruddy hills of the region with his skin tone. 

The Murugan of Sangam literature – a considerable corpus of classical devotional and literary works – has a peacock for his mount and wields a lance or vel, after which his priests and the chieftains of the hills, the velan (“bearer of the lance”), were named. 

By the 5th century CE, Murugan’s attributes were fused with those of Skanda (also known as Karthikeya, Subrahmanya and Kumara), a god found in the literature of the Epic period of the north  (when the Ramayana and Mahabharatam were composed). Devotional compositions authored by Saivite poet-saints around the 7th century CE incorporated him into the Saivite pantheon and worshipped him as the son of Siva. (Followers of Siva are called Saivites.) 

Murugan’s roots in a long and rich Tamil cultural heritage is perhaps one of the reasons why he is a recipient of unwavering faith, celebrated across the global Tamil diaspora.

#### **A Myth Celebrated**

திரிய விட்டெறிந்து,
நோயுடை நுடங்கு சூர் மா முதல் தடிந்து

You swirled your weapon 
and destroyed Sur[an], personified fear, who had taken the form of a moving mango tree 

- Lines written by Kaduvan Ilaveyinanaar and set to music by Kannanaakanaar appearing in the Paripadal (V: 3–4).
