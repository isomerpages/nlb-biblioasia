#### **Introduction**
This essay explores the impact of the emerging scholarly discipline of the
“science of religion” on the Confucianist movement in Singapore in the late
19th and early 20th centuries. Anna Sun’s recent study on the modern origin of Confucianism as a “world religion” foregrounds the role of James Legge, a missionary and an Oxford University professor, in the establishment and dissemination of the scholarly category of “Confucianism” in the period.1
However, her study is limited to an exploration of the impact of Legge’s
scholarship on the study of world religions in the Western academic and
missionary circles.

The author hardly mentions Legge’s career in Malacca and the influence his study of Chinese classics had on missionary and Confucian reformist circles in Singapore at the turn of the 20th century. While it delineates a historical arc that connects mutual contestations between the secular and religious interpretations of Confucianism from the 19th century British Empire to present-day China, her book neglects analogous debates articulated in the Confucianist and Christian intellectual circles in the Straits of Malacca.

This essay is an attempt to include the voices of Confucian reformers in the
Straits of Malacca in the study of the history of Confucianism in its modern,
global format. It will highlight the formative role of intellectual exchanges,
between Western scholars and/or missionaries and local Confucianist
thinkers, in the conceptualisation of Confucianism as, simultaneously, a
national (Chinese) religion and transnational (global) political force. Apart
from East Asian societies and states, Confucianism has also played an
important role in Southeast Asia. Historical trajectories behind the relatively
recent (2006) acknowledgement of Confucianism as a state-sponsored
religion in Indonesia, and Confucianism as an ethical regime that governs
the conditions to sociability in postcolonial Singapore, deserve comparative
studies of their own.

As an initial step in that direction, this essay discusses the articulations of
Confucianism through the perspective of the comparative study of religions,
as it was understood by the Confucian reformers in Singapore – led by Lim
Boon Keng – at the turn of the 20th century. I will argue that the debates
between the Chinese reformists and the Straits-based British missionaries
on the religious status of Confucianism cannot be properly understood
without taking Legge’s academic and missionary/theological authority into
consideration. This argument is supported by an analysis of a series of essays
and notes written by Lim during the period. By placing Legge within the
history of the Confucian reformist movement in the Straits of Malacca, I
aim to foreground the constitutive role of Southeast Asian reformers in the
modern history of Confucianism in its global dimension.

Missionaries and scholars of world religions played a role in the debates
where Confucianism was introduced onto the world map as a religion and
promoted as a leading force in a new, China-centred global order as it was
imagined from within the Straits of Malacca. The religion-related debates in
the Straits of Malacca were no exception in the period under consideration.
According to Peter van der Veer, religions in the Chinese and Indian
modern contexts were transformed into “moral sources of citizenship and
national belonging” – rather than marginalised or eliminated – through
their contact with the emerging political project of secularism as a colonial
governing tool of religious and cultural difference.2

Apart from playing a crucial role in the formulation of “national imaginaries”,
the encounter with the imperial West enabled religions to be utilised to form
– or imagine – supranational alliances and “alternative visions of the moral
state”.3 This essay will show that the case of Lim Boon Keng’s articulations
of Confucianism, as a religion and source of transnational moral citizenship,
is an excellent example of the contradictory effect of secularism in a colonial
setting, in van der Veer’s sense. In the spirit of the times, Legge conceptualised
Confucian religion as a defining element of the Chinese race/nation. It was
through a critical study of Legge’s translations, conceived from within the
imperial context of Britain and related global missionary aspirations, that
Lim developed his perspective of Confucianism as, simultaneously, a national
(Chinese) and supranational (global) social and historical force, fit to form the
basis of a new world order. In other words, Lim conceptualised the new world
with a reformed China as its leader.

This essay will show that Lim’s personal engagement in, or substantial
proximity to, the mutually opposing/constitutive social and historical
projects – i.e. Christian proselytisation and the Confucianist movement,
were, in van der Veer’s sense, responsible for the formation of a neutral
cognitive space. That space was contained in the newly established “science
of religion” which, with its authority anchored in rationality and “scientific
objectivity”, had a pacifying effect on the debate between missionaries and
Confucian reformists. In other words, the authority of deciding about the
religious or secular/philosophical nature of Confucianism was placed in the
realm of science, at a distance from ecclesiastic authorities. Lim’s multiple
political alliances (to Britain and a reformed China) also decidedly marked
his image of Confucianism as compatible with liberal democracy. In short,
Lim embraced the lessons learned from his reading of the scientific approach
to the study of world religions and used them to build his view of a new
world history with Confucianism as its progressive goal. In this process, Lim
adopted, contested or elaborated on Legge’s translations of the Confucian
classics and views on Confucianism in relation to Christianity.

Lim’s crucial role in the Confucianist movement in the Straits has already
received substantial scholarly attention.4 However, his engagement with Legge’s scholarly work is noted only in passing.5 In addition, Lim’s
knowledge of the science of religion and its impact on his articulation of
Confucianism as a world religion has entirely evaded the attention of the
scholars working on the topic.

This essay, in turn, foregrounds the historical entanglement, between
Protestant contestations and scholarly world-religion consolidations of
Confucianism, in the construction of Lim’s view of this religion, and its
place in the new world order as a political form of universal humanity,
and a condition to modern, transnational and moral citizenship. Apart
from van der Veer’s study, my approach to the study of the emergence of
Confucianism, as a religion and global ethos in the Straits of Malacca, is
also indebted to Tomoko Masuzawa’s study of the history of the concept
of “world religion” within the discipline of science of religion and, in
particular, the epistemic formation of this concept’s universalistic, supraethnic,
or transnational, character.6

As Masuzawa shows, during the 19th century, the category of “world
religion” emerged to help articulate the self-image of Europe as an ideal
model of universal history, or leader of an international, global order on
the one hand. On the other, this new category also served to (self) portray
Europe as the sole custodian of harmonious regulation of internal differences
within nation-states.7 Stated otherwise, world religions through their study
within the new discipline of science of religion were approached as defining
elements of non-European nations.8 The study presented in this essay, like
those of van der Veer’s and Sun’s, acknowledges the ultimate intellectual
legacy of Talal Asad’s enquiry into the mutual formation of the religious and
the secular through the colonial encounter.9

Only when approached as a singular analytical field of enquiry can Lim’s
views of Confucianism, simultaneously a religion and global political force,
be understood as an effect of mutually transformative historical exchanges
between the opposing social movements of Christian proselytisation (and
related global domination) and Confucianist Chinese emancipation.

#### **James Legge and the Study of Confucianism**
James Legge (1815–1897) was the first professor of Chinese at Oxford
University, where he worked from 1876 until his death. Before becoming
a professor, Legge spent a large part of his life (1839–1873) as a missionary
for the London Missionary Society, with postings in Malacca and Hong
Kong.10 In the contemporary academic world, Legge is best remembered for
his English translations of the Chinese classics, as well as his engagement in
the scientific study of Chinese religions in general – foremost of which was
Confucianism.11 His lasting scholarly reputation was instrumental in shaping
the current global perception of Confucianism as a defining element of
Chinese culture, nation and politics.

Legge’s first missionary posting in Malacca only lasted four years, from
1839 to 1843. Nevertheless, by the time of his death, Legge was a wellknown
Christian proselytiser, scholar and educationalist in the Anglo-
Chinese circles in Singapore. Early in his career, Legge personally financed
the education of Song Hoot Kiam, who was to become one of the most
prominent English-educated Christian Chinese intellectuals in Singapore,
and two other boys in Hong Kong and Scotland.12

Song commemorated Legge’s life in a few obituaries13 published in *The
Straits Chinese Magazine: A Quarterly Journal of Oriental and Occidental Culture* upon Legge’s death in 1897.14 This periodical, in circulation
between 1897 and 1907, was co-founded and co-edited by Song’s son,
Song Ong Siang, a Chinese Christian community leader and an English-educated
intellectual. Along with Lim, Song Ong Siang was a recipient
of the Queen’s Scholarship, the award that enabled both men to study
in Britain.15
During his studies in Britain in the late 1880s or early 1890s, Song Ong
Siang visited Legge at his home in Oxford, where the latter was working on
his translations of Chinese texts.16 Although this visit did not prompt Song
Ong Siang “to take up the study of Chinese classics”,17 his fellow Chinese
reformist Lim showed great interest in Legge’s translations and views of
Confucianism.

*The Straits Chinese Magazine*, or SCM, was intended, among other goals, to
encourage debate among the Straits intellectual elite of “all nationalities who
are in every respect better educated than those of a former generation”.18
Lim, one of the most vociferous Singaporean Confucian reformists of the
period, who was also a founder and co-editor of the SCM,19 published
his critiques of Legge’s understanding of Confucianism and proposed a
different picture of the religion’s role in facilitating the overall progress of
the Chinese people. In so doing, Lim made an invaluable contribution to
the then emerging concept of “objective” or “scientific” study of religion,
which explored Confucianism as a “world religion” within the new scholarly
discipline of comparative religion.20

Masuzawa shows that one of the fathers of the science of religion – known
today as comparative religion – Friedrich Max Müller, developed this
discipline based on his expertise in Sanskrit philology and language.21
Specifically, between 1861 and 1870, Max Müller formulated his science of
religion upon his previous field of expertise, the science of language. His
comparative study of religion was, in fact, based on comparative philology.
The analytical connection between race/nationality, language/culture and
religion, which has endured to the present, has been attributed to Max
Müller. This despite the fact that, as Masuzawa argues, Max Müller was
openly against establishing a relationship of biological or physiological
causality between languages and races.

In other words, Max Müller opposed, unsuccessfully, the development of
racialist philology.22 His opposition was directed at the anthropological
prescriptions for “race” prevalent at the time, which suggested discrepant
origins of different races, where “difference” was treated as a biological
fact. Instead, Max Müller was in favour of a shared origin of humankind,
supported through his comparative study of the family of languages.23
Apart from this particular racial or national aspect of religion, Masuzawa
notes that the imperial conquest and aspirations of Christianity, and also
encounters with Buddhism, simultaneously shaped the transnational or
supra-racial character (or aspirations) of religions.24

Max Müller’s concept of “universalistic humanity”25 and the historical
entanglement between the Chinese race and Confucianism all made a
decisive impact on Lim’s articulation of a Confucianist world order, as
discussed later in this essay. Whereas the intellectual connection between
Max Müller’s science of religion and Lim’s Confucianism remain
unexamined, academic collaboration between Max Müller and Legge is a
well-studied phenomenon.

#### **Legge in Malacca and Early Years in Hong Kong**
In the preface to his first volume of *The Chinese Classics*, Legge made a
comment on his posting in “the East” (i.e. Malacca), where he arrived
“equipped with… a few months’ instruction in Chinese from the late
Professor Kidd at the University of London”.26 Legge was to assume his
duties as the principal of the Anglo-Chinese College in Malacca. This
position meant that he had an unhindered access to the college library.
Dissatisfied with the then-existing state of translations of classical Chinese
texts into European languages, Legge made an outline of his prospective
study and translation of these texts before 1841, planning to publish his
work in seven volumes. From the onset of his stay in Malacca and having
the required books and dictionaries within his reach, Legge engaged in the
study of a set of works he translated into English as “Confucian Analects”.27
These translations were included in his first volume of *The Chinese Classics*,
published in 1861 while he was in Hong Kong. There, Legge offered his
definition of the “classical” Chinese texts:

   *The Books now recognised as of highest authority in China are<br> 
   comprehended under the denominations of “The five King”,<br> 
   and the “The four Shoo”. The term King is of textile origin, and<br> 
   signifies the warp threads of a web, and their adjustment. An easy<br> 
   application of it is to denote what is regular and insures regularity.<br> 
   As used with reference to books, it indicates their authority on the<br> 
   subjects of which they treat. “The five King” are the five canonical<br> 
   works, containing the truth upon the highest subjects from the sages<br> 
   of China, and which should be received as law by all generations.<br> 
   The term Shoo simply means Writings or Books*.28

By the early 1860s, Legge had already been engaged in the preaching to
and teaching of the Chinese for 21 years. The substantial experience he
gained convinced him that he would have remained unqualified for his
missionary job unless he “had thoroughly mastered the Classical Books of the Chinese”.29 In those books, Legge believed, the sages of China
established “the foundations of the moral, the social, and the political life
of the people”.30 His translations of the *Classics* were intended foremost for
the benefit of missionaries and students of Chinese language and literature,
though Legge hoped that they could also be of use to the general public.31

At the age of 11, Song Hoot Kiam became one of the boarders of the Anglo-
Chinese College in Malacca when Reverend James Legge was its principal.32
More than half a century later, Song was still able to recall his years in
Malacca under Legge’s supervision in great detail.33 Written in memory
of the recently deceased Legge, Song’s recollections of the Anglo-Chinese
College in Malacca were intended for the “friends of the late Professor all
over the globe who would be interested to hear anything relating to any, the
shortest, part of his long and useful career”.34

According to Song, Legge managed to gather around 45 Chinese boys as
boarders in the college. This was quite an accomplishment, as most Straits
Chinese at that time ascribed little value to an English education for their
children, while some viewed missionaries with suspicion. Song recalled that
most inhabitants of Malacca were engaged in fishing or growing rice, with
little commerce going on in the town. He remembered Legge as a strict but
righteous principal and teacher when in college, and a friendly playmate
during the few daily excursions he organised for his students.35

From Malacca, Legge relocated to Hong Kong to take charge of the Anglo-
Chinese College there. When he left Malacca, he took two Chinese girls and
a Chinese boy with him. In the meantime, Song’s father placed him and his
elder brother in a private Chinese school in Singapore. Unwilling to give
up on their English education, Song and a fellow student soon managed to
“escape” from Singapore and take an adventurous trip to Hong Kong, where they continued their studies at the Anglo-Chinese College, with financial
support provided by Legge himself.36

In 1846, Legge, Song and two other Chinese students arrived in London
after a six-month sea voyage. They were subsequently located in Scotland
where they received further education as well as baptism in 1847.37 The
following year, the three Chinese students returned to Hong Kong and
Singapore respectively. Song married and settled down soon after that, thus
establishing “the oldest family of Straits Chinese Christians in Singapore”.38
The two men kept in touch until Legge’s death.39

#### **Legge’s Missionary and Academic Careers**
Legge continued working on the Chinese texts over the great number of
years he spent as a missionary educator in Hong Kong.40 Even though his
work did not always progress at the desired pace, the third volume of his
*Chinese Classics* appeared in 1865.41 Legge’s *The Chinese Classics* were well-received
in the contemporaneous academic circles. He retired from his
missionary duties in 1873 and returned to England, where he was widely
recognised as “one of the first and best translators of Chinese classics”.42 In
1876, he became a professor of Chinese language and literature at Oxford,
where he taught and worked on translations until his death in 1897.

In 1875, Max Müller contacted Legge expressing his admiration for the latter’s
translation of *The Chinese Classics*. In this period, Max Müller identified
and approached potential academic collaborators for an ambitious project
entitled *The Sacred Books of the East*, published in 50 volumes between 1879
and 1910.43 Max Müller’s desire had been to study religions in a scholarly, “scientific” manner.44 To achieve this, he relied on the method of mutual
comparison of doctrinal texts or canons of various religious traditions in Asia.

In his preface to *The Sacred Books of the East*, Max Müller identified
eight “great and original religions which profess to be founded on Sacred
Books”.45

   *Apart from the interest which the Sacred Books of all religions<br>
   possess in the eyes of the theologian, and, more particularly, of<br>
   the missionary, to whom an accurate knowledge of them is as<br>
   indispensable as a knowledge of the enemy’s country is to a general,<br>
   these works have of late assumed a new importance, as viewed in<br>
   the character of ancient historical documents*.46

Max Müller’s list of “world religions”, as they are called at present, included
what are known today as Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Zoroastrianism,
Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism. 47 *The Sacred Books of the
East* were intended to provide translations of the books of all the mentioned
religions, with the exception of the first two.48

Legge’s contribution to *The Sacred Books of the East* project consisted of his
translations of the “Sacred Books of China”, which comprised four volumes
on Confucianism and two volumes on Taoism.49 Although the Englishlanguage
term “Confucianism” was not used in scholarly circles or outside
of them during this period, Legge was the one who defined and promoted
its academic usage. According to Sun’s research, the term “Confucianism”
was first recorded in 1862, independent of Legge. However, it was Legge
who first used it in a paper presented in his absence before a Protestant 
Missionary Conference held in Shanghai in 1877, where he compared
Confucianism with Christianity.

The reaction of his fellow missionaries was to reject the proposed
comparability between the two – Christianity was understood as the only
true religion and was thus beyond comparison. Legge used his collaboration
with Max Müller to further his views of Confucianism as a “world religion”
and support his translations of it to related theological concepts in terms
hitherto reserved for Protestant Christianity.50

In his preface to *The Sacred Books of the East*, Legge noted that there
were three religions in China – Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism –
and viewed the former as “the religion of China par excellence”. Unlike
Buddhism, both Confucianism and Taoism were native to China.51 This
classification of certain spiritual, ritualistic and philosophical traditions
into the three religions of China has had a lasting scholarly and popular
influence on current perceptions of what counts as religion in the Chinese
context. Importantly, Legge’s promotion of Confucianism as the defining
concept of Chinese identity was undertaken not only by Western academics
and missionaries, but also by the most prominent Singaporean Confucian
reformist, Lim Boon Keng, which will be discussed shortly.

In 1880, Legge delivered a series of lectures at the Presbyterian College
in London, which were subsequently published in the same year as *The
Religions of China: Confucianism and Tâoism Described and Compared
with Christianity*. In these lectures, Legge defined Confucianism as “the
ancient religion of China”, which comprised views of Confucius, “the great
philosopher himself”, written directly by the sage or narrated in the writings
by his disciples. He thought it erroneous not to regard Confucius as a religious
teacher.52 At that time, the missionaries working in China rejected Legge’s
attempt to view both Christianity and Confucianism as religions that could
be compared. To the majority of Protestant missionaries working to convert
the people of China, the proposal of comparison itself was unacceptable and
“too liberal”.53

Although he regarded Confucianism as a religion and compared it with
Christianity, Legge thought this religion was inferior to Christianity due
to the latter’s individually accessible worship of God. Confucianism, Legge
explained, still allowed for the worship of spirits, unlike the only proper
religion – i.e. Protestant – Christianity.54 Legge thought that this aspect
of Confucianism developed over time due to the monopolisation of the
worship of God by the Emperor, which prevented ordinary people from
worshipping God.55 Legge had personally experienced this insight during
his visit to the Temple of Heaven in Peking56 where he stood barefoot and,
together with his Christian friends, sang a doxology in praise of God.57

   *I rejoice in the imperial worship of God, but I can never<br>
   sufficiently regret that this shaped itself even in prehistoric time into<br>
   a representative worship by the head of the state, instead of being<br>
   extended throughout the nation, and joined in by the multitudes of<br>
the people*.58

Legge thought that the lack of individual access to one’s worship of God
helped the spread of sin among the Chinese people, thus preventing
their growth and development.59 He saw Confucianism as an ethical
regime exclusively focused on the regulation of social relations. Its goal
was to prescribe conditions to sociability through defining five types of
relational duties perceived to uphold all social structures. These entailed the
relationship between sovereign and subject, father and son, husband and
wife, brothers and friends.60 According to Legge, lacking in this scheme
was the relationship to God as the central defining element of humanity,
conceptualised through “[o]ur Christian catechism”.61 This particular aspect of Legge’s theological assessment of Confucianism apparently had a lasting
effect on Singaporean missionary circles.

In fact, Legge’s missionary work in and on China was celebrated in the
Singapore press long after his death.62 Another obituary commemorating
Legge’s missionary achievements, besides Song Hoot Kiam’s, was also
published in the SCM.63 It was written by Legge’s fellow missionary J.A.B.
Cook, who had the opportunity to personally attend Legge’s Presbyterian
College lecture series in 1880. Cook assured readers that Legge was a
zealous missionary and that all his scholarly work was “to bring the stores
of his learning to the service of Christ”.64 He went on to support Legge’s
understanding of Confucianism as a religion inferior to Christianity, in that
it focused on ethical regulation of social relations and failed to prioritise – or
even introduce – a relationship between God and believer.65

Reverend W. Murray relied on Legge’s writings in his outline of reasons as to
why he regarded Confucius as a failed religious teacher in comparison with
Jesus Christ. Murray quoted Legge’s essay on “Christianity and Confucianism
Compared in Their Teaching of the Whole Duty of Man”, which was
included in a missionary-sponsored publication called *The Religious Tract
Society* from London, and issued throughout the 1880s and later. There,
Murray quoted Legge’s opinion of Confucius’ “untruthfulness” as the mark of
a standard of morality lower than the impeccable morality of Christ’s.66

A note to the article states that it was originally delivered in the format of
a lecture given at the Young Men’s Christian Association of Singapore on
20 May 1905. Murray noted that within a short period of time, “a student
of Confucianism” had published a profound critique of the lecture in
*The Singapore Free Press*. Hence, Murray revised the original lecture and
published it as the SCM article under current discussion, erasing those
“portions of the material not relevant to the argument” but leaving its conclusion intact. In fact, the process of revising the article enabled Murray
to overturn the main line of the “student’s” critique. To recall here, the
latter insisted that Legge abandoned his early conviction in Confucius’
untruthfulness as the cause of the low state of morality in China. It was then
that Murray turned to “Christianity and Confucianism Compared in Their
Teaching of the Whole Duty of Man” in which Legge had expressed his
doubts about Confucius’ truthfulness.67
