####  In 1960, 23 unsuspecting cats found themselves being airdropped into Bario, Sarawak, as part of a rat-busting operation.
By Ho Sie Sie

In tropical Sarawak, it often rains cats and dogs. On 17 March 1960, somewhat unusually, it rained only cats – 23 cats to be precise. The cats, together with 7,000 lb (3,175 kg) of equipment and supplies, were parachuted by the Royal Air Force (RAF) into Bario in the Kelabit Highlands in Sarawak, from a height of 400 ft (122 m). “It ‘rained’ cats in the Bario District of the Kelabit Highlands in Sarawak,” announced the _Singapore Free Press_.[^1]

After five test runs over the drop zone, the cats were dropped off via a “giant Beverly transport” plane. The _Straits Times_ reported that “\[h\]undreds of excited Kelabits on the ground watched the big operation which took more than an hour.”[^2]

“\[The cats\] landed bang in the middle of the zone. After the operation, the operations officer of the Sarawak Civil Aviation Department, Mr John Seal, congratulated the R.A.F. on ‘a magnificent job’.”[^3] Operation Cat Drop was a success.

#### 	**Operation Cat Drop**

Bario is a remote hamlet in the Kelabit highlands deep in the interior of Sarawak. In 1960, Bario’s rice crops were plagued by an infestation of rats. Their call for help was answered by Kuching, Sarawak’s capital. Kuching (which means ‘cat’ in Malay and is also known as the City of Cats) appealed for at least 30 cats (ultimately they were only able to find 23) for the mission. The cats were to be “packed expertly into wicker baskets and parachuted into the padi”[^4] to combat the aggressive rats. Located 4,500 feet above sea level and inaccessible by road,[^5] the RAF felt that the easiest way to send the cats to Bario was by air.

A month after the “army of cats from heaven” were released, the Kelabit sent Kuching this message on 18 April 1960: “Thanks for the cats – no more trouble with rats and mice.”[^6]

#### **Flying (and Falling) Felines**

The Kuching cats were not the first felines to be ferried by the RAF on pest infestation duties. In December 1953, the RAF delivered a cat to the men at Fort Legap in Perak. The cat was “sent down in a specially padded box along with the rations” to deal with rats that had been eating their rations. It is not clear if this cat was parachuted to Fort Legap. The terse news report merely said that the RAF plane had “dropped a live cat to men.”[^7]

However, a few months after that, the _Straits Times_ reported without ambiguity that two cats (one black, one white) were dropped from a height of 350 feet (106 m) in parachute containers from an RAF Valetta to an airfield in Kuala Lumpur.

A jungle fort in north Malaya had requested for cats to chase away rats and mice that had been destroying their food supplies. To deliver the animals to the remote location, the RAF wanted to see if was possible to parachute the animals down.[^8]

The cats seemed to take the experience well. “\[The cats\] both seemed quite jolly about the whole thing. They were none the worse for the parachute drop... When the seals were broken, the two cats jumped out of their airborne container, licked their paws, and walked away,” the _Straits Times_ on 21 June 1954 reported an officer of 55 Company RASC Air Despatch as saying. Deeming the experiment a success, the plan was for the cats to be parachuted later that week to do their job in their new home. [^9]
