  the Nanyang Connection"
permalink: /vol-4/issue1/apr-2008/chinese-world-jinan-university-nanyang/
description: Using Jinan University as a case study, this essay looks at the
  under-explored area of education to study Chinese migration and the overseas
  Chinese communities. The university is the first institution established in
  China (founded in 1906 in Nanjing) dedicated to the education of Nanyang
  Chinese migrants and their offspring.
