#### **Introduction**
In September 1935, a group of immigrant Chinese artists established the
Society of Chinese Artists (SOCA; 中華美術研究會), or Société des artistes
Chinois, in Singapore. These Modernist artists were distinct from the
preceding generation of artists, who were mostly born in the 19th century
and schooled in the classics under the tutelage of traditional scholars, and
whose works were produced in the traditional mode.

In this paper, I examine the prewar and postwar (late 1920s–early 1950s) art
scene in Singapore: the life and work of the active but lesser-known SOCA
Modernist founders, the relationships among them, the prevalent styles of
their work, the historical and social circumstances that shaped their art, and
the art spaces they used. Although these artists are neither well documented
nor canonised, they were part of the vibrant prewar and postwar art scene.
My study reveals a microcosm of artistic germination and rich human
dynamics in the prewar and postwar art scene and fills the gaps in our
knowledge of early Singapore art history.

The art scene from the turn of the 20th century up to the eve of Singapore’s
independence has been analysed by Yeo Mang Thong as consisting of four
strands of development:1
