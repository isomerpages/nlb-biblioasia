####  Singapore’s history is closely intertwined with that of Lingga’s. The kings that once reigned from its shores played a pivotal role in the fate of the Malay world, including the birth of modern Singapore, as **Faris Joraimi** reveals.

iIn a half-forgotten corner of Telok Belanga (officially rendered as Telok Blangah),
sandwiched between Bukit Purmei and Kampong Bahru Road, lies the tomb of
the last king of the Riau-Lingga Sultanate, Sultan Abdul Rahman Mua’zzam Shah II (r. 1883–1911). Deposed by the Dutch in 1911 after refusing to sign a treaty that
would effectively strip him of all power, he fled to Singapore where he lived in exile until his death in 1930.
