One of the wonderful things about Singapore is our multicultural society which allows us to easily experience the culture of others, whether it is the Chinese Mid-Autumn Festival or a Malay wedding. One of the more colourful examples is Theemithi, the annual firewalking festival held at the Sri Mariamman Temple on South Bridge Road. (It takes place a week before Deepavali, on a Sunday.)

While many people know about the firewalking, few understand its significance
and or why it even takes place. For an insider’s take on [Theemithi](/vol-18/issue-3/oct-dec-2022/theemithi-firewalking-festival), don’t miss curator Nalina Gopal’s deep dive into the festival, accompanied by some amazing photographs.

In this issue, we continue to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the fall of
Singapore, this time with an essay by writer Shirlene Noordin. This is a piece that
weaves in personal history and relentless detective work to bring us a deeply moving
story about how her [grandfather survived working on the Thai-Burma Railway](/vol-18/issue-3/oct-dec-2022/grandfather-romusha-thai-burma-railway).

On a happier note, we have a quirky story about an island resort that predated
Sentosa – [Sarong Island](/vol-18/issue-3/oct-dec-2022/history-sarong-island-sentosa-singapore). Librarian Lim Tin Seng delves into a forgotten chapter in
Singapore’s history.

Another fascinating piece recounts how [Johor ended up exhibiting at the 1893
Chicago World’s Fair](/vol-18/issue-3/oct-dec-2022/johor-chicago-world-fair). The story by former Lee Kong Chian Research Fellow Faris
Joraimi about how 25 men and women from Johor spent a cold Chicago spring
demonstrating sarong weaving makes for interesting reading.

If popular culture is more your thing though, don’t miss our profile on [Loke
Wan Tho](/vol-18/issue-3/oct-dec-2022/loke-wan-tho-cathay-cinema/), the man behind Cathay Cinema and a fascinating figure in his own right.
The piece by former librarian Bonny Tan looks at his interesting hobbies, such as
birdwatching, and features wonderful images.

Meanwhile, we also revisit the early days of [family planning](/vol-18/issue-3/oct-dec-2022/family-planning-singapore/), the making of the [Monetary Authority of Singapore](/vol-18/issue-3/oct-dec-2022/history-monetary-authority-singapore-central-bank), the history of [Union Book](/vol-18/issue-3/oct-dec-2022/history-union-book-bras-basah-singapore/), and [Cold War propaganda battles](/vol-18/issue-3/oct-dec-2022/cold-war-propaganda-singapore/).

Plenty of great reads ahead, perhaps over the long Deepavali weekend. And to
all our readers who celebrate it, I would like to wish you a Happy Deepavali!
