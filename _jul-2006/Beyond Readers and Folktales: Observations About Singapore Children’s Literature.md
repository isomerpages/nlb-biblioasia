####  Singapore children’s literature has an important role to play within the larger context of children’s literature. Stories that portray Singapore children with their worldview, realities and values capture the identity of the Singapore child and reflect how they redefine themselves in the face of different cultural realities.

#### **Multicultural Children’s Literature**
The study of multicultural children’s literature has been making significant inroads into the domain of children’s literature. However what constitutes multicultural literature? According to Higgins (2002), the term “multicultural” is used to describe “groups of people from a nonwhite background, people of color, or people of all cultures regardless of race”. In the context of this definition, a study of Singapore children’s literature would definitely fall within the realm of multicultural literature.

One may ask, why is there a need to study multicultural children’s literature or Singapore children’s literature in the first place? Hazel Rochman (1993) succinctly explains that multicultural literature “can help to break down \[barriers\]. Books can make a difference in dispelling prejudice and building community”. More importantly, “a good story lets you know people as individuals in all their particularity and conflict” (Rochman, 1993). For Singapore, an awareness of multicultural children’s literature would help to throw light upon the different realities in a pluralistic society like ours, where “learning how people from other cultures do similar things in different ways can help children gain a sense of acceptance and appreciation for diverse cultures” (Hillard, 1995).

There are two ways of looking at this. Firstly, through exposure to multicultural literature, children would gain a better understanding of themselves as they “identify with characters that look like them” and they would then be able to “participate in shared cultural traditions and daily experiences” (Pataray-Ching & Ching, 2001). Secondly, the existence of multicultural literature would have an empowering effect as it is written evidence of the contributions made by those not belonging to the mainstream white culture that is highly prevalent in the publishing industry.
