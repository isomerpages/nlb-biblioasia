_A huge iron anchor has been part of the permanent exhibition at the National Museum of Singapore since 2015. About 2.4 m tall, it is originally from the RMS Empress of Asia, which was destroyed off Singapore in February 1942. At the time, the ship was transporting Allied troops to help reinforce Singapore’s defence during the Japanese invasion. The following story commemorates the 80th anniversary of this wartime loss._

Geoffrey Hosken’s school exercise book was an odd choice for a seaman’s diary on a 16,909-ton troopship. Stamped in big black letters are six danger points for schoolchildren, starting with “Don’t run across the road without first looking both ways!” and ending with “Don’t forget to walk on the foot-path, if there is one!”[^1]

The 25-year-old able seaman from Vancouver recognised the irony given his rough and tumble existence on the world’s oceans. But he really didn’t mind what others thought of his little green scribbler.

It was February 1942, and there were 30 pages to fill, several of which would describe the next 32 hours as his ship, the RMS Empress of Asia, steamed towards her death off Singapore. 

With an unyielding pencil, Hosken wrote: “Wed., Feb. 4, 3 A.M… Lagging behind convoy as usual and cruiser keeps signalling to pick up speed for we are endangering the whole convoy.”

Worrisome words because the 30-year-old Canadian Pacific coal-burner was in dangerous waters off the east coast of Sumatra, in the narrow channel known as Bangka Strait. Just over a day’s sail from Singapore’s Keppel Harbour, the old “greyhound” of the Pacific was last in line with four other troopships in Convoy BM-12 which she had joined at Bombay (now Mumbai) on 23 January. The “firemen won’t or can’t get the steam,” noted Hosken. “Doing 12–13 knots and about a mile behind.” (Firemen are the men in the stokehold of a merchant ship who feed coal into the furnaces, heating the boilers that produce steam to drive the turbines.)
At the head of the convoy was the City of Canterbury, followed by the Dutch liner Plancius, the Devonshire, and the ex-French, 17,083-ton Félix Roussèl. Escorting were British cruisers HMS Exeter and HMS Danae, the Australian sloop HMAS Yarra, the Indian sloop HMIS Sutlej and two destroyers.

High above, a formation of twin-engine Japanese fighter-bombers scoured the sky and placid sea, paying attention to the islands and straits that forced convoys into single file.

In December 1941, while the Asia was off Africa between Freetown and the Cape of Good Hope, the Japanese shocked the world at Pearl Harbor and attacked the Philippines and Hong Kong. On 10 December, they sank Britain’s two capital ships, HMS Prince of Wales and HMS Repulse, based at Singapore. By Christmas, they had taken Kowloon Peninsula and Hong Kong, having forced British and Canadian troops to surrender after overwhelming them. 

With Singapore as a major prize, the Japanese chose not to attack the island from the sea, avoiding the 15-inch guns, three of which could traverse 360 degrees. Instead, they landed in Thailand and northern Malaya on 8 December 1941 and advanced south with artillery, tanks and infantry on bicycles while aircraft attacked airfields and ground positions. By late January, around the time the Asia was collecting members of the British 18th Division at Bombay, the enemy had repeatedly bombed Singapore and was at the southern end of the peninsula.

While the Asia laboured through the Bangka Strait on 4 February, the Japanese were 11 days from forcing the British to surrender what many had thought was an impregnable fortress. 

The night before Hosken noted the Asia’s lack of steam, Ordinary Seaman Jack Ewart had been in the crow’s nest 23 m above the water. At the time, Convoy BM-12, which had rendezvoused with Convoy DM-2, was in the Sunda Strait between Sumatra and Java. That was when the young Canadian thought he heard aircraft engines and picked up the phone to the bridge. Ewart was told he was probably hearing the engines of another ship off Asia’s starboard beam. When the ships reached the northern end of the Sunda Strait, several broke off and headed east to Batavia (now Jakarta) to support the Dutch colony while five ships headed northwest towards Bangka Strait.

Fourth Officer Walter Oliver had sailed most of the world’s oceans and earned the coveted master’s certificate. He had helped transport oil from the Dutch East Indies and once kept a cabin at Palembang, Sumatra. Oliver was familiar with the Singapore approaches and on 4 February the Asia’s position – “well in the rear” of the convoy – was apparent.2 

Hosken, meanwhile, could see that his ship was not only last in line, but also visible with three massive smoke stacks. She carried the most number of military personnel: 2,235 compared to the Devonshire’s 1,673, had a crew of 413, and was heavy with military supplies.3

Painted wartime grey, the 180-metre-long Empress of Asia was not without firepower and her crew included 25 personnel drawn largely from the British Army and Royal Navy. To preserve the ship’s merchant and non-combatant status, these men, known colloquially as DEMS (Defensively Equipped Merchant Ships), signed on as deckhands and were part of the crew. In addition to the DEMS, several crew members had gun training. 

The anti-aircraft armament consisted of a 12-pounder (three-inch gun) fitted aft, close to the six-inch gun, six large-calibre Oerlikon guns, and 10 Hotchkiss light machine guns, six of which were secured within machine-gun nests near the bridge.4 The ship also had a parachute and cable anti-aircraft system launched by rockets. Missing was her Bofors anti-aircraft gun, which had been transferred to the British Army in North Africa. 


**The First Attack: Wednesday, 4 February**

By 11 am, Hosken was helping prepare mooring lines for coming alongside at Singapore, approximately 525 km to the northwest. He detected what Ewart thought he had heard the night before: aircraft engines. “About 11:30 gunfire started and I looked up and saw nine planes coming over at quite a height. Then there were eighteen of them. I started forward to get lifebelt and helmet. Was going along the starboard alleyway on A deck, just about the purser’s office when bang, I thought the ship was broken in half.”
