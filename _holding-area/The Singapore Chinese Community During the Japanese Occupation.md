By Lee Meiyu and Seow Peck Ngiam

The year 2022 marked the 80th anniversary of the fall of Singapore. This essay features documents that offers insights into the lives of the Chinese in Singapore during the Japanese Occupation (1942–45). Donated by various individuals and clan associations, these materials are an invaluable source of research for scholars and other interested parties alike. 

The donors include the late Nanyang historian and bibliophile Tan Yeok Seong, the first to generously gift his collection of books acquired over a lifetime – the Ya Yin Kwan Collection (椰阴馆) – to the National Library in the 1960s. The collection is rich in Singapore and Southeast Asian research materials, and is now housed on level 10 of the National Library Building on Victoria Street. 

Just before the fall of Singapore, many Chinese clan associations destroyed the documents that they had accumulated over the years – such as membership lists with names and addresses – to prevent them from falling into the hands of the Japanese army. And as these clan associations were inactive during the war, records of their activities during this period are scarce. Nonetheless, the National Library of Singapore does hold a collection of items relating to the war and the occupation years that were donated by the Chinese community in Singapore.

##### The Dairies of Hsu Yun Tsiao

The late Professor Hsu Yun Tsiao was an eminent Nanyang historian who left his hometown in Suzhou, China, for Singapore in the 1930s in search of opportunities. He meticulously recorded his daily experiences and thoughts in five diaries, which began in the 1930s and ended on 24 February 1942, the 10th day after the British surrender. 

Hsu vividly described the Japanese air raids, the desolate scene of the ruins after the bombings in Raffles Place and the mass screenings carried out by the Japanese army during Operation Sook Ching. These records serve as valuable primary materials on an important period in Singapore’s history.
