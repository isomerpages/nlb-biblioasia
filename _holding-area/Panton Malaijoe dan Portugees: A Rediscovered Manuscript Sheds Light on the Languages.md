Some time around 1865, in the storeroom of Bernard Quaritch’s antique bookshop in London, an employee rummages through stacks of documents in search of a manuscript to be delivered to Ernst Reinhold Rost, the secretary to the Royal Asiatic Society and a regular client. When the manuscript finally emerges, it does not look particularly distinctive. It is comparatively small in size (21 × 14.5 cm) and length (39 folios), and is encased in rough, undecorated paper bearing an intriguing handwritten title in Malay: Panton Malaijoe dan Portugees (Malay and Portuguese Pantun). 

The employee takes a moment to leaf through the item and notices it contains a number of texts resembling poems, organised in quatrains. Some are written in what appears to be a variety of Malay and identified by their titles as “Pantoons”, while others are called “Cantigas” and rendered in a language that looks decidedly Romance, at least as far as words are concerned. So, judging from the manuscript’s title, perhaps Portuguese? There is even one text that mixes both, with each alternating verse in a different language. Whatever it may be, the manuscript is due to be picked up fairly soon, so the employee packs it carefully and places it on the despatch desk.

This episode may be slightly fictionalised here, but its essential components are factual and correspond to the moment in which the trajectory of this manuscript, Panton Malaijoe dan Portugees, first becomes traceable on the basis of the documentary evidence available so far.&nbsp;

After the manuscript was acquired by Rost, it went on to have a number of different owners until it finally wound up in the vaults of Portugal’s Museu Nacional de Arqueologia (National Museum of Archaeology) in Lisbon, where it languished for a number of decades before resurfacing in 2018. The significance of this discovery would eventually lead to the 2022 publication of Livro de Pantuns (Book of Pantuns). This bilingual book, edited by a team of five of which I was a member, provides contextual studies on the history of the manuscript as well as the verses inside, with explanations and annotations, and the Portuguese and English translations of the verses.1&nbsp;

The journey of the manuscript from a London bookshop to the Lisbon archive was marked by stops and starts. After its acquisition by Rost, the manuscript ended up circulating within a network of European philologists who realised its importance as a linguistic record, especially with respect to the sections identified as “Portuguese”, which they recognised as a rare sample of a Portuguese-lexified creole (a language resulting from substantial contact between Portuguese and other languages) from Insular Southeast Asia.2 &nbsp;

#### **The Manuscript Changes Hands**

Interestingly, the initial protagonists of the manuscript’s recorded history were all Germans. The antique bookseller Quaritch was German, as was Rost, an orientalist specialising in Asian languages (such as Sinhala and Malay) and literature. Rost spent most of his career in England, where in addition to his position with the Royal Asiatic Society, he was also a librarian at the India Office.

The other important German who played a central role was the eminent linguist Hugo Schuchardt, a prominent figure in the history of linguistics. He spent most of his career at the University of Graz in Austria and had an extraordinarily vast range of scientific interests encompassing Romance languages, the Basque language, and the dynamics and effects of language contact. To pursue all of these, Schuchardt developed a vast global network of correspondents from whom he obtained linguistic data and relevant sources. Rost was one of them.

The correspondence between the two men reveals that Rost sent the manuscript to Schuchardt in 1885 as a loan and 10 years later, shortly before his death, turned that loan into a gift.3 Schuchardt, who was particularly interested in Portuguese-lexified creoles, realised the manuscript must have represented the variety spoken in and around colonial Batavia (present-day Jakarta), a language for which he had amassed other relevant sources.&nbsp;

In 1890, Schuchardt published a lengthy article about this particular Portuguese Creole language, titled Über das Malaioportugiesische von Batavia und Tugu (On the Malayo-Portuguese of Batavia and Tugu), in which he transcribed and analysed all the linguistic data he had collected except for that contained in Panton Malaijoe dan Portugees. The omission of the manuscript was not an oversight nor a belittlement of its relevance. Quite the opposite, in fact. In his published text, while discussing a dialogue transcribed in a 1692 work by George Meister, Schuchardt remarked:

Etwa aus derselben Zeit als die Meisterische Probe stammt eine handschriftliche Sammlung malaioportugiesischer und malaiischer Pantuns, die ich schon wegen ihres Umfanges für eine besondere Veröffentlichung aufsparen muss.4  
  
\[From approximately the same period as Meister’s text, there exists a manuscript collection of Malayo-Portuguese and Malay Pantuns which, in view of its size, I am reserving for a separate publication.\]

Sadly, this follow-up study never materialised. In the meantime, the manuscript caught the attention of another prominent scholar: the Portuguese doctor, philologist, ethnographer and archaeologist José Leite de Vasconcelos. He was another of Schuchardt’s regular correspondents and the two actually met in 1900 in Graz, where Vasconcelos was given the opportunity to consult the manuscript. He was intrigued by it and, a few years later, asked Schuchardt for a copy of its contents.&nbsp;

As we gather from their correspondence, this request was not well received by Schuchardt since he was still planning to publish a substantial study of Panton Malaijoe dan Portugees.5 However, he eventually decided to bequeath the document to Vasconcelos. After Schuchardt died in 1927, the manuscript was despatched to Lisbon. Even though Vasconcelos clearly intended to work on it, he never published a study on the document either. As a result, despite various  
references to the manuscript and the clear interest shown by some of the leading early scholars of language contact, its contents remained a mystery until very recently.

Panton Malaijoe dan Portugees Resurfaces

Vasconcelos was a leading figure in Portugal’s academic scene of the early 20th century, developing fundamental research and many initiatives that still resonate in the country to this day. One of these was the establishment in 1893 of the Museu Etnológico Português (Portuguese Ethnological Museum), the predecessor of the modern Museu Nacional de Arqueologia (MNA). Vasconcelos was the director of the museum for many decades, which explains why the MNA’s archive now holds part of his personal archive – a large collection of publications, letters, fieldwork documents and manuscripts.

One of those manuscripts is Panton Malaijoe dan Portugees, but this was not confirmed until 2018 when Ivo Castro, a fellow professor at the University of Lisbon, and the MNA’s librarian, Lívia Coito, stumbled across it while rifling through a number of boxes in the archive.6 Aware of the history of the manuscript and of its scientific value, Castro shared the news with me and we invited three other specialists – Alan Baxter, Alexander Adelaar and Gijs Koster – to collaborate in a comprehensive study of the manuscript. Over the following three to four years, the team worked jointly and finally published Livro de Pantuns | Book of Pantuns, a bilingual (Portuguese and English) book dedicated to the manuscript.

The core of Livro de Pantuns consists of an edition of the manuscript with a transcription of its contents (plus, in the case of the Malay texts, a proposed textual reconstruction and a version in modern Bahasa Indonesia). It also has proposed translations into Portuguese and English, with comprehensive footnotes containing commentaries about the manuscript and the authors’ analyses. The book also includes a full facsimile reproduction of the manuscript and four chapters in which the five authors explore various aspects of the document – namely the history and materiality of the manuscript, as well as the linguistic and literary characteristics of the Malay pantun and the Portuguese Creole cantigas (a Portuguese term for “song”).

#### **Tracing the Genesis of the Manuscript**

Since Panton Malaijoe dan Portugees is undated and makes no reference to a place of production, determining who may have been responsible for compiling the manuscript is a challenge. Schuchardt was convinced that it had been produced in Batavia sometime in the late 17th century, and he was probably right.  
Various hints point to Batavia, which was the epicentre of the Dutch East Indies between the 17th and 20th centuries. The use of northern European-produced paper, European-style calligraphy and some Dutch-like orthographic solutions all suggest a European-influenced environment that would have been found in Batavia at the time.

In principle, a collection of Malay and Portuguese Creole pantuns could also have been produced in other Dutch-controlled locations of Southeast Asia (such as Melaka), but Batavia emerges as the most likely source. This is evidenced by the abundance of references in the texts to Java, in the form of toponyms (such as Banten, Tangerang and Batavia itself), fruit, plant and food names, and even historical events.

The language in the texts also has links with Java’s linguistic ecology. In the Malay-language texts, a few forms are more readily recognisable as reflections of Javanese words than Malay/Indonesian words, while the language of the Portuguese Creole texts is  
especially reminiscent of the Batavia and Tugu samples published by Schuchardt and recorded in a few other complementary sources.

Having established (with a fair amount of certainty) that colonial Java was the most likely setting for the production of the manuscript, we are still left with the issue of dating the document. In this respect, all we can say for sure is that the manuscript could not have been completed before 1690.&nbsp;

This insight is based on two historical episodes referenced in the pantun. The Portuguese Creole text, Cantiga de Tangerang mais Bantam (Song of Tangerang and Banten), narrates the conflict between Sultan Abu'l-Fath 'abdu'l-Fattah (Ageng Tirtayasa) of Banten and his son, Abu Nasr Abdul Kahhar (Sultan Haji), which saw the involvement of the Dutch East Indies Company in 1682.8 Another pantun, the Malay-language Panton Joncker (Jonker Pantun), describes events relating to the presumed rebellion of Captain Jonker, an Ambonese serving in the Dutch colonial army, which took place in 1689, culminating in his death that year and the deportation of his children to Ceylon in 1690.9&nbsp;

While it is impossible to tell how long after these events the texts were written, the amount of detail suggests their memory may have been fairly fresh. Therefore, it is quite possible that the manuscript was completed in the late 17th century or the early 18th century.

It is also unclear whether the people who produced the manuscript were the ones who transcribed these originally oral texts or whether they worked on the basis of earlier written records. Either way, we do know the process must have been collaborative as an analysis of the calligraphy reveals that different sections were produced by different writers. That said, they certainly obeyed a masterplan because despite the multiple copyists, the result is a cohesive document in terms of form and content.&nbsp;
