</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Mention the word Peranakan, and the image of some Chinese looking lady
wearing a <em>kebaya</em> comes to mind. But what most people don’t know
is that there’s actually a community of Indian Peranakans as well – known
as the Chetti Melaka. The culture shows many similarities to the Chinese
Peranakans, but also important differences as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m Jimmy Yap, and with me in the studio is Tanya Pillai-Nair. She’s a
member of the Chetti Melaka Association in Singapore. And recently she
helped put together a beautiful cookbook, <em><a href="https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/redir/itemdetails?bid=300003913" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Heritage Food of the Peranakan Indians in a Chetty Melaka Kitchen</a></em>.
Tanya was also a guest in an episode of the National Library’s cooking
show <em>From Book to Cook</em>. And in that episode, she made a dish known
as <em>otak blangah</em> with the help of her Aunty Danam.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, welcome to BiblioAsia+, Tanya. You put together this book, and I have
to say thank you for giving us a copy. It looks amazing. For the people
who don’t know about the Chetti Melaka, who are the Chetti Melaka and where
did they come from?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>Love to share that with you. So, you know, some people are Chetti Melaka
but don’t even know it. So, I’m hoping that this will reach them. So, if
you remember your grandmother wearing a <em>kebaya</em>, cooking certain
foods, speaking Patwa Malay, her own version of Malay, chances are you
could, you know, be related to all our Chetti Melaka family.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We originated in Melaka, in this lovely little town of Melaka. And we
would have come out from as far back as the 13th century.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>The 13th century. That’s pretty far back.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>Yeah. With the Chola Empire, actually. In essence, we were merchants.
They would come up with the monsoon winds for six months and couldn’t go
home. So, we had to stay put and formed families, married Malay women,
and would then return back to the Coromandel coast – you know, Tamil Nadu
– and return with goods from the Malay Archipelago. So that trade route
was very, very critical for centuries, and people don’t realise, but that
little village still exists.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh, where is it?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>It’s in a place called Gajah Berang, which means angry elephant. And at
the start of the <em>kampung</em>, you will see these two elephant heads
as a gateway. And then this beautiful little <em>kampung</em> will unfold
before you.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>And it is a Chetty Melaka <em>kampung</em>?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>It is. But, you know, in the <em>kampung</em>, you still do have some old
Chinese families. They’ve lived there for hundreds of years, too, along
with us. And temple trustees own the land. And on this land, they have
13 different temples and shrines.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>How big is this place?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>I would say five Padangs.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>How many families live in this village?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>We know that about 200 families that still live [there]. We’ve moved all
over the world, you know. Some of us are in Sweden, lots of us in America.
Many in Australia. And the beautiful thing about this little book is that
people write to us from different parts of the world now.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Since the book has been published, you mean?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>Yes. Relatives have given them the book and they’re busy trying to transform
them with local ingredients. And they tell us, “We want more books. We
want to buy more books.” Or, you know, give us little snippets of what
they are cooking today.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>That’s lovely. So, you gave us some examples: wearing a <em>kebaya</em>,
speaking a version of Malay. How are the Chetti Melaka similar or different
to and from the other communities?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>The Chetti Melaka have a very strong Hindu faith there. They’re Shivites,
you know.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>And you mentioned there’s like 13 shrines and temples.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>And all very important, you know, and some of the festivals that we have,
like the Dato Chachar festival. People come from all over the world, all
over Malaysia as well, because they want to, you know, have a cure for
chicken pox and any kind of skin ailment. So, they go to that particular
deity and temple for a cure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And festivals are really central to this village, and that’s how they’ve
maintained a culture over the centuries. And interestingly, the food culture
is very, very special. We didn’t realise until midway through this book
how critical food culture is and how it needs to be documented. And what
we have is just the tip of the iceberg, Jimmy, because there is a ritual
called <em>parachu</em>. And this is our ancestor worship.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>What happens at <em>parachu</em>?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>So <em>parachu</em> takes place twice a year. One of them is fruit <em>parachu</em> in
June. And June is where you have all your, you know, mangosteens and durians.
And then around January, February, we also have a meat <em>parachu</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <em>parachu</em> is when we serve the dishes that our ancestors enjoyed
the most, you know, and those dishes have to be cooked in exactly the same
way. You cannot taste it. You cannot talk as you’re cooking it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh, you cannot taste it as you are making it?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>You cannot. It’s like an offering, right? And then you display on a banana
leaf and you’re done in the evening. Then all your family members will
gather, even the ones that live far away from KL. They come home and then
they sit down. We let the ancestor[s] enjoy this meal that we prepared
for them. We invite them to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then around 8 pm, when they finish their meal – we give it about 45
minutes – then we eat from the same banana leaf, you know, we share it.
So as a child, I have really, really, vivid memories of this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We would do our <em>parachu</em> while my grandmother, great grandmother
were alive. We would do it in the home that they lived in, in Seletar Hills,
with their daughter, my Aunty Chemmi. So, I remember sitting around a leaf.
You have to choose who you sit with, because you want someone that doesn’t
eat half of the leaf. You want to have some left over. So, we pick and
choose which cousins we sit with.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Not the big guys.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>Yeah. And then you get to enjoy all the dishes. And coming back to why
it’s so special. This food culture is because <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">the dishes don’t change how you cook it</a>
<a href="#_msocom_1" class="msocomanchor" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[SP1]</a>&nbsp;. You have to cook it in its traditional way. So, you don’t
use a blender; you use a <em>batu giling</em>. You don’t use a steamer.
You use a traditional steamer charcoal burner. So, you keep it as authentic
as you possibly can.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Wow. That sounds like a lot of work.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>And recipes are authentic, too, you know? Okay. So, for example, there
is a very special dish called <em>lauk pindang</em>, in our book. And we
like to think everybody does a <em>pindang</em>, you know, even the Malays.
And we were always told growing up, better cook this dish, because if you
don’t cook it, it won’t be around for much longer. So we knew it’s like
a dying dish.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Yeah, but there's value in that, right? Because as you say, you know,
apart from the religion, the food itself helps to keep the community’s
identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>Absolutely. And also a reminder of what they enjoyed. And this is typically
what a <em>parachu</em> leaf would look like. So, lots of little dishes surrounding
a big mountain of rice. And every family has a different <em>parachu</em>.
As I said, just now – a <em>sambal telok belimbing</em>. So <em>belimbing</em> is
a sour starfruit, a mutton curry, a chicken curry, a <em>buncis rempah</em>,
which is like a cabbage. A <em>kacang panjang rempah</em>, long beans. <em>Kubis rempah</em>,
I think that’s cabbage. <em>Terong masak ikan kurau</em>. This is a cucumber
with salted fish. <em>Timun santan</em> again, cucumber in coconut milk. <em>Achar chilli</em>,
this is our version of <em>achar</em>. Everybody knows Nyonya <em>achar</em> right,
but just slightly different classic <em>kuyit timun</em> using just the cucumber
skin and <em>udang goreng</em>. Delicious. Another dish you must try: lots
and lots of <em>melaka</em>  <em>belacan</em> in that, <em>kambing goreng</em>.
This is all the fried things, the fried dishes. <em>Ikan goreng</em>, <em>ayam goreng</em>,
all the fried dishes and then the rice is <em>nasi lemak</em>, so we do
a <em>nasi lemak kukus</em>, which is like —&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>— steamed.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>Steamed rice. It takes eight hours. And that’s the rice for <em>parachu</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Can I ask you: so <em>parachu</em>, is that something that only the Chetti
Melaka do or is that a Hindu thing as well?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>It’s, well, I think we do it in this really unique way with all the dishes.
The favourite dishes of our ancestors. But I’ve seen, you know, other Hindus,
like my husband is, you know, from Kerala. His family's from Kerala and
they do it in vegetarian dishes, but they would have the same 12 different
dishes, but all vegetarian and very small.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s just you put it, it’s like a little offering on a banana leaf just
for your parents. But for us it is seven banana leaves laid out on the
floor… seven, five, one. You choose depending on how big your family is,
right? The ones that come back to participate.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>That is very interesting. So, we are starting to see some of the differences
and similarities with other communities. And of course, the language itself
is also based on Malay?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>With a few nuances. I mean, there’s a few words that are slightly different.
Like, for example, if we ask you in Malay, we would say “<em>Ini hari masa apa?”</em> What
are you cooking today? We would say “<em>Nyari masak apa</em>?” So, we
would just join it up, so <em>nyari</em> becomes a word. Or like Krishna,
a very common Hindu name, right? We would then use Kisna. Kisna. So, my
dad’s a Kisna. It’s a very cute way of, you know, saying Krishna for example.
So, these are things I didn’t realise were different.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>That’s so amazing. And I want to play for everyone this amazing song that
the Chetti Melaka Association commissioned a couple of years ago, which
I think really captures what being Chetti Melaka is, you know, how it’s
a combination of different cultures. And some viewers or some listeners
might actually find this song a little bit familiar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Music]&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>Yes, we’re a very musical bunch and we will <em>ronggeng</em> in a heartbeat.
You know, and in all our homes, I’ve seen accordions, tablas, violins even.
So, when the [Association of Chetti Melaka] put the CD together, they wanted
to capture the sounds of what you would hear in a village.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They did all of our favorite folk songs with a very nice, you know, Indian
composition, and this was in 2018 when this was created, and we felt there
was a space for it, right? So, we combined Indian classical musicians with
Malay instruments. So, you can hear, in that song, a very unique arrangement,
don’t you think?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Yeah. Yeah. I’ve never heard <em>Di Tanjong Katong</em> quite like that.
So, you know, that was, that was quite wonderful. How big is the community
in Singapore? I mean, there’s an association, right?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>We have a lovely story to share with you on that. So, I would say about
5,000 Chetty Melakas. We estimate, you know, maybe about 500 families.
Like I said, not many people know that they’re Chetty Melaka. So, when
the book was launched, people would come up at the book launches. They
would show us pictures of their grandma, and they would say to me, she
wore a <em>kebaya</em>, but I’m not sure, you know, if she’s Chetty Melaka.
So, I laugh and I say, definitely Chetty Melaka. What did you eat growing
up? And then they tell me their dishes – and I know they are.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, isn’t it funny not being aware of your heritage? Not realising it.
Thank goodness for this little association because it really encapsulates
what we love best about it. The openness, the diversity. Because it’s not
just Chetty Melaka. You know, we have people from all walks of life and
all different Peranakans, we have different people that join us because
we want to keep it alive and we need the skill set of everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>This association – when was it set up?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>So, in 2005 – President [SR] Nathan, himself. His mother was Chetty Melaka.
Yes, she wore a <em>baju kurong</em>. Anyway, so he then calls up Lee Kip
Lee at that time in 2005, who is the president of the Peranakan Association
[Singapore], and says, “Do you have any one Indian that’s in your [association]
that signed up?”&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>So out of nowhere he calls Lee Kip Lee.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>Yup, and so [Lee] said, “Do you know I had this one fella called Mr. Pulu
Kalasri and he signed up a week ago.” And so President Nathan said, “Well,
I’d like to invite him to the Istana. Can you give me [his] contact details?”
So, then he was summoned to the Istana – Mr. Pulu that is – and President
Nathan said, “You need to, you know, do more. You need to start an association
and you need to build, you know, knowledge and awareness about who the
Chetty Melaka are.” And then he introduced him to his very good friend,
Samuel Doraisingham, and said, “Samuel Doraisingham is actually of Sri
Lankan origin, he’s a historian and he’s going to help you document your
culture.”&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>And so this book was then created, <em><a href="https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/redir/itemdetails?bid=12687570" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Peranakan Indians of Singapore and Melaka</u></a></em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>And that book was published in 20…?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>15.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>2015.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>Yeah.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>And so the association then, dates back to 2015?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>Yes. Yeah. We had President Nathan inaugurating that of course, and he
wrote the foreword. So, you know, we were so lucky to have that jumping
off point. Right?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Well, when the president tells you gotta go and do this, I think most
people jump.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>Yeah, it was so wonderful, right? I’m so lucky. I think he must have felt
the love in the kitchen, I suspect. I’m sure. And never forgot it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And we keep trying to, you know, enroll more, have more sign ups. And
now with the book launch, we can add a lot more people to it. So we’ve
had, you know, Clarence Ling, who runs Allspice [Institute]. And he and
his chefs helped us recipe test, which was critical. Because our recipes
came in different ways. We had <em>katis</em>, we had cups, we had <em>agak-agak</em>,
like a ball-size of this or a palm-size of that.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>You had to, like, standardise everything.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>You had to, enough for a professional cookbook. So, the chefs came in
and they didn’t get involved with the recipe at all. All they did was they
measured all our <em>agak-agak</em>. So, we measured it together and we
cooked it. It’s not easy to replicate without very clear measurements.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>So, tell me about the coming together of this cookbook. This was a project
of the association? Did you just open up, you know, a tattered exercise
book and just type out all the stuff in there?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>How do you know that? It is really old exercise books. You’re absolutely
right. It is beautiful recipe books. So, two years in the making. Again,
seed money came from the National Heritage Board. And at that time we really
didn’t know how to create a cookbook. You ask for your seed money, which
is basically 40 percent of what the book costs to produce. And what we
asked for was nowhere near what you need for a book.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, we realised now, you know, it was probably underestimating the whole
project completely and we had to do it because if you don’t, you have to
give back your seed money. So, there’s no way we could have – there was
no option out. Once you went down that path, you had to really stick to
your guns, and you had all the different timelines that we had to meet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, we got to a point where we actually managed to build momentum. Lots
of people worked on it, different people, different committee members,
you know, previous committee members even worked on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Where did these recipes come from?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>They came from mothers and grandmothers and from the village itself. You
know, the Gajah Berang, Melaka Village as well. So many of these dishes
are scribbled in exercise books. It’s in English, it’s in Malay, it’s in
all these different measurements. We had to make some sense out of it.
But that was the fun of it. So, we had two wonderful editors. One of them
is Rowena Rao, and we all have day jobs. We don’t really do this as a job.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But she is Chetty Melaka. She knows the voice of <em>nenek </em>[grandmother].
So, as we were doing this, we used that as our benchmark, “What would <em>nenek</em> do?”
”How would <em>nenek</em> do this?” Because we know our <em>nenek</em> was
a really good cook, right? And then we realised everybody’s <em>nenek</em> is
the same, you know? And somehow that little voice in your ear is the voice
in the cookbook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So we’ve tried very hard to infuse, you know, <em>nenek</em>’s essence
into this book. And from her recipe books, you know, I don’t remember our <em>neneks</em> writing
anything down, but they would always say, “Watch me.” Then you learn, right?
And that's the only way to learn. Our <em>neneks</em> are no longer here,
so we have maybe third- or fourth-hand versions that they carry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yeah, but thank goodness they invited people into their kitchens. So,
Aunty Danam’s mother and father were in Melaka, but because her eldest
sister married into a family in Singapore, our family, they then decided
to send her to live with my grandmother for three years to learn to cook
because she didn’t know how to cook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She was 16 years old. So, she came to our kitchen and the <em>nenek</em> looked
after her, protected her, you know, cherished her and taught her everything
that they knew. And lots of wonderful <em>kueh</em> she learned and all these
different dishes. When we were doing this, she said, “I'll give you the <em>otak blangah</em> recipe.
Your grandmother gave it to me. I learnt it in your grandmother’s kitchen,
your great grandmother’s kitchen.” So, you know, that’s how this recipe
came back to us. I never cooked it. And then we did it for you, you know,
yesterday, because it’s a difficult dish to cook if you don’t see it done.
And there is so much, so much in the steps. You need to see how the <em>ikan parang</em> is
cut, little nuances that you can’t get, you know, from a book unless you’re
watching the <em>nenek</em> cook. You know, that’s how we did it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Sounds amazing. And how many recipes are there in a book?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>So, we put 91 in. But the truth is, now we could go higher because people
are coming in with – when they see how we’ve treated these recipes, they
know that there’s so much love involved in it. The authenticity is key
for us. The measurements are important. The fact that we don’t take sides,
you know, that same recipe can have six different family versions. We don’t
want to change anything, nor do we put ownership to one.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>So how do you – if [there are] six versions, what version ends up in the
book? All six?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>We have a baseline version, which is very similar throughout. Otherwise,
it’s not the same dish, but every family will do it a little bit differently,
so maybe they’ll add a different ingredient. So yeah, that’s the gift of
this book. You know, different variations. Nobody’s left out. <em>Nenek’</em>s
voice is there telling you that there are many variations to this same
baseline dish. But so far, you know, we’ve been so buoyed by the, by the
enthusiasm of so many and also the memories. It’s a very visceral connection
to your past.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>That’s the wonderful thing about community projects. It sounds like this
book brought the community together and now that it’s published, is continuing
to bring the community together. And as you say, bringing people who didn’t
even know that they were Chetty Melaka.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>Right, right.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Tell us a little bit about your own sort of journey as a Chetty Melaka?
Did you grow up knowing you were Chetty Melaka?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>So mum is a Chinese Peranakan and dad is Indian Peranakan. And [the] food
is so similar both my grannies cooked the same food, and I realised that
we were different because of the fact that we spoke Malay at home, that
we ate <em>sambal belacan</em> that none of that put us off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, how did I know we were different? I think I started to realise when
I was about seven or eight that, you know, our parties were huge, made
up of everybody and everybody. Food, lots and lots of food, every table
covered by food and unusual food. When you go to other people’s parties
it’s not the same.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then, of course, people [spoke] English and Malay. It’s a mixture.
So yeah, I noticed that we were a little different then. And then my dad
used to say, you know, he couldn’t speak Tamil; people would expect him
to speak Tamil, he could only speak Malay. And in a <em>kampung</em> he had
to spend many a time, you know, defending himself because he couldn’t speak
it, being bullied for not speaking. So that was funny, I thought.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Was your father Hindu originally?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>Yes. So, the family’s all Hindu. I mean, there’s a funny story, but my
grandfather would wake up at 4 a.m. in the morning and pray. Okay, very
loudly.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>This is in Singapore, right?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>In Singapore. All his life. So, the story. My grandfather’s unusual, shall
I tell you? He sold goat’s milk. And he was orphaned at the age of 10.
And we don’t know his origin. We have no idea. But with his goat and his
goat’s milk, he sold it in the Gajah Berang <em>kampung</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, he meandered through the <em>kampung</em> in the morning and would sell
goat’s milk. And the person that adopted him, took pity and took him in,
he had a cow herd and he took [my grandfather] in and raised him as one
of his own, educated him, you know, because he was a smart boy. So, he
educated him and then [my grandfather] rose through the ranks of the civil
service and moved to Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway. So, coming back to his religion, midway through [his life], I
think in his late fifties, he actually had a vision of the Virgin Mary
[during] one of his 4 a.m. prayers. Yeah. And then he had to make a decision,
you know, how is he going to continue [being] a Hindu? Is he going to become
a Catholic? So, to get permission, he had to go back to the village, ask
for permission from his family, his adoptive brothers. And they agreed
because, you know, the Hindus believe that everybody is born Hindu. That’s
you and everyone. Okay. But we choose different paths. So you are Hindu
first, and then you choose Catholicism or Taoism. Isn’t that a beautiful
way of looking at religion?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>I’m amazed that he went back to the village to ask for permission. This
is like serious business.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>It’s the village that took him in as a child and he owed them so much
– educated him ahead of other children. So, he really felt that he needed
to get permission and so he did.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay. That’s amazing.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>Yeah. And so when he became a Catholic, he actually was allowed to have
a few of his children join him. So, some of our family are Hindu and some
of them are Catholic.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>What kind of dishes are distinctly Chetty Melaka or recognisably Chetty
Melaka?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>We have to have, you know, a nice fried fish. We have it almost for every
meal.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay. So fish is very important.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>Yes. Fish. Fish is always, you know, definitely a staple – fried fish.
Being seafarers. You know, a lot of people in the village actually would,
you know, go take their boats out and they would fish. Right. The ocean
might give you different different fish, different times of the year. We
would love to cook. How about a <em>sotong masak hitam</em>?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Ah okay. Okay.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>We would love a nice prawn dish. We would do a <em>sambal udang</em>. We
would definitely use <em>melaka</em>  <em>belacan</em> and that one you’d have
to get from Melaka – it’s thin, thin flat square bricks of <em>belacan</em>.
Not so salty.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>It has to be <em>melaka</em>  <em>belacan</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>And then maybe a nice meat dish. So here I would always do <em>ayam buah keluak</em>.
Interestingly, not many people cook <em>buah keluak</em>. <em>Buah keluak</em> is
the black nut. Yeah, yeah, that’s right.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Yeah. The Peranakan Chinese.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>Yeah. It’s expensive. You know, so many families will grow up not eating
it because it’s too expensive to buy.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>It’s a lot of work, right?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>It is a lot of work. So how we do it is slightly different from the Chinese
Peranakans. We would not, you know, scoop out the ingredients and then
mix it with pork, chicken and stuff it back in again into the nut. We would
just let you taste the nut on its own.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>You never scrape out all the ingredients?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>We never. You scrape that yourself.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>In <em>From Book to Cook</em>, you and your Aunty Danam made <em>otak blangah</em>.
For the people who have not watched the episode yet: How is this dish different
from, you know, the <em>otah</em> that more people in Singapore are familiar
with?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>So the <em>blangah</em> is like a clear pot. So everything, all these ingredients
are combined into a claypot and the patty is meat. And that is put into
the sauce of the clay pot. And you can make it as dry as you want. You
can make it as liquid as you want. So depending on what you eat it with,
right? So if it’s like a side dish, I would make it fairly dry when you
have other dishes with gravy. But yesterday we made it with <em>roti jala</em>.
So we want[ed] to make it a little watery.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>The <em>roti jala</em> that you had yesterday is a little bit different
[from] the <em>roti jala</em> that [most] people know as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>It’s a thicker pancake. You know, and therefore it doesn’t crisp as well.
And that’s probably what we are more used to eating now. So, if you were
to buy it from the shops, that’s the Malay version, right? And then we
have our version where we use the little five spouted ladle and the circles
that we make are very small concentric circles and it becomes like a laced
pancake.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So this is called <em>roti jala</em> because <em>jala</em> means “net”. So
same batter, but different style, you know, different style of shaping
it onto a hot griddle, hot pan, like that. And we used to have to eat it
crispy and hot, slightly crispy and hot. So the only way to achieve this
is to cook it for you at the moment.<em>&nbsp;</em>
</p>
<p>My dad has always been fastidious about his Christmas parties and we always
produce <em>roti jala</em> and we have to make it hot at that moment, you
know, for all guests. No matter how many guests that come, one of us is
stationed at the oven doing it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Well, tell us about, you know, now that the book is out. So where have
you gone. Who have you gotten feedback from? Like, how far afield?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>How far afield? I think, well, I would say Canada. They’re starting to
cook the dishes. The USA, they’re starting to cook dishes there too. Australia.
Beautiful, beautiful comments have come because some relatives have already
started mailing it to them. They’ve ordered it and I think what people
are really amazed at are the photographs.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>The photographs are brilliant.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>Yeah.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>So gorgeous.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>Yeah. So, we have Annette Wong, our photographer, for the whole book and
she has so much heart, and a wonderful eye and, and you know, like I said,
we had very little budget for this book. But a lot of it, people put in,
you know, a lot of love and attention and time, you know, and and I would
say Annette gave us far more than, you know, than anything that we could
have given her for the book.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>And hopefully she got to eat a lot of these dishes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>Every time. So, yes. So the photoshoot day was fun. You know, photoshoot
day starts at 9, and doesn’t end till 8.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Constantly eating?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>Constantly eating – 17 dishes. And on a tough day, we were doing 17 dishes
at a go.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>It sounds like this is a lot of work. I mean, I cannot imagine and none
of you would working on it full time. So this was your part time job? What’s
next for the Chetty Melaka Association then?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>I think we are going to be focusing on doing more with the book this coming
year. We would love to have fairs, you know. Even our friends from the
Arab network – they were so excited at our book launch, as we invited them,
and they were saying we should be doing a festival together. So, you know,
and of course, the museum now with the Peranakan Museum reopening – almost
quarterly, there’s an event there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, we’d love to, you know, participate more and more. And I would love
to see some of these dishes being cooked in, you know, in schools, even
[by] our children. It’s everybody’s heritage. Right. And I’d like to see
some of that happen as well. I remember cooking some very Peranakan dishes
in my home economics class.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We used to make the <em>ikan bakar</em> for sure, and, you know, many of
these dishes. I think I would love for Singaporean children to be experts
in. And they can take it wherever they go.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Thank you very much for taking time to speak to us. At this point in our
podcast, we typically, you know, move away from the heavy topics and go
off on a little bit of a tangent. What is a must-try dish in your cookbook,
something that’s also relatively easy to make for someone with no cooking
skills like me?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>So, Jimmy, really the <em>lauk pindang</em> is simple. It’s just boiled <em>rempah</em> and
a bit of coconut milk. And you’re set.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>And you’re saying even I can make it?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>Anybody can make it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay, I will try and make it. Complete the sentence. It’s important to
preserve our heritage foods because….?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>They are so connected to our biodiversity. If we don’t eat this food,
we won’t have it anymore. You can see the <em>petai</em> in the market. But <em>remis</em>,
you [don’t] see anymore. So that’s because we don’t eat it, right, there’s
no demand for it. So I would like to see us go back to eating more <em>kampung</em> vegetables.
And these vegetables should be in, you know, our food vernacular almost.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You know, we don’t have gardens anymore, right? I’d like to see us get
more culturally specific about our food and keep that heritage. Otherwise,
it’s gone. It’s gone forever – only exists in cookbooks.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>I hope not. Okay. Complete the sentence. Food is…&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>Love.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Why is it love?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>
<br>I remember when you come home from a long journey. You know, like my Aunty
Bira. She’s been thinking of you. You’ve been working long hours, and you
know, you haven’t called home yet, so you haven’t had a chat. And I would
get a message from her to say, “Today I went to the market and I found <em>ikan terebok</em>.”
Which is a very scaly fish that you fry. And it’s amazing when you fry
it. And she goes, “Make sure you come for dinner, you know.” And so this
will be the invitation. <em>I haven’t seen you for a long time. I go to the market and I look for things that you love. And I think of you whenever I buy, right? And I cook for you. </em>And
once she goes, you won’t get that anymore, right?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yeah, it is love. So, this book is all about that love, actually.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
