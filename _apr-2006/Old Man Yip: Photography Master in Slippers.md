#### Yip Cheong Fun was one Singapore’s most eminent photographers. His ability to capture, “the decisive moment” made him unique among the photographers of his generation.

#### **Life in Chinatown**
Nothing in Yip Cheong Fun’s early life suggests that he would become one of Singapore’s most eminent photographers. He was born in Hong Kong in 1903, the son of a farmer. At the age of 7 months, his parents left Hong Kong for Singapore where he remained till 1909. His father died in 1907 and his mother, unable to cope with having to eke out a modest living and caring for her children, sent him back to China to be placed in the care of relatives. Unfortunately, his relatives neglected him and he returned to Singapore in 1913 after his relatives’ neighbours alerted his mother to his plight. From then on, he stayed with his mother at 47 Kreta Ayer Street. This would be his home for the rest of his life.

Yip had a basic Chinese education in a private school in Chinatown. He was mechanically-inclined and apprenticed in an engineering firm where he picked up a number of technical skills that stood him in good stead over the years. After school, he worked for United Engineers as a supervisor but quit the firm in 1942 after discovering that it was making munitions for the Japanese. Yip then started an engineering workshop at the back of his three-storey Kreta Ayer Street house. His wife ran a provision store, named Cheong Loong at the front of the store while Yip, his nephew and some workers operated a machine shop, complete with die cutters, moulds and lathes in the back.

By 1936, Yip had married and established a family. He had a little spare cash and purchased a Rolleiflex camera; his very first. This was to be a start of a life-long love affair with the photographic arts. When he set up his workshop in 1942, he also set up a darkroom. Now that he was his own boss, he had more time for photography.

After World War II, Yip ventured into three other businesses, all of which failed. The first was the manufacture of tin toys (like cars and aeroplanes). Using his skill as a machinist, Yip made these toys out of tin, which replaced the much heavier wooden toys of old. However, when plastics became popular in the 1960s, he gave up the business. He also began manufacturing joss-sticks in his Kreta Ayer shophouse. This business folded when his partner struck out on his own. Finally, Yip and his wife manufactured a tea-dust based shampoo which the Cantonese referred to as *char chye fun*. This powder was mixed with water to make a paste is applied to the hair much in the same way as shampoo. It was marketed under the shop’s name, Cheong Loong and proved popular among the older ladies living in the area. However, with the advent of modern shampoo, that business also failed.

#### **Latecomer to Photography**
Yip Cheong Fun was a latecomer to photography. He was already in his thirties when he picked up his first camera. In the beginning, he used it like any hobbyist and doting family man; to record images of his family and of his familiar surroundings. After the Japanese Occupation, Yip began taking more photographs of other subjects.

The devastation wrought by the war kindled in Yip a passion to record on film, his changing environs. He began taking photographs of the same site a few years apart; mostly around his beloved Kreta Ayer area, recording the changes that have taken place over the years. Yip was also much inspired by the vitality of the human spirit, and the ability of man to overcome hardships and setbacks. This can be seen in his photographs of people, especially his portraits of fisherfolk, *samsui* women and construction workers. The spirit of toil and endeavour shines through in each photograph. Yip felt deeply for the poor and the down-trodden in Chinatown. He explored every nook and corner of the area after the war and captured images of social activity of a time gone by. His ability to capture, what Henri Cartier-Bresson calls “the decisive moment” made him unique among the photographers of his generation.

#### **Master Yip**
Yip’s first success in photography was in 1952 when he began sending his prints for international competitions. A prudent man all his life, Yip processed and developed all his own black and white prints. His print, *Rowing at Dawn*, won for him a string of top prizes and gold medals in international salons and was exhibited in over 80 countries. Before long, Yip began winning other prizes and gained international recognition. In 1957, he was made Associate of the Royal Photographic Society, and four years later, Fellow of the same society. In Singapore, his photographic and technical skills earned him a job at Tien Wah Press in 1960. There, he was involved in commercial photography and also provided technical support and maintenance for the printing house’s machinery.

In 1974, Yip was made Honorary Fellow of the Singapore’s oldest photographic society, the Photographic Society of Singapore and in 1984, he was awarded the coveted Cultural Medallion. One of Yip’s highest honours was to be named one of 10 ‘Honorary Outstanding Photographers of the Century’ by the prestigious New York Photographic Society (NYPS) in 1980. At a special exhibition, Yip earned this distinction for his seascapes and four of his prints: *Tranquility*; *Rowing at Dawn*; *Early Morning*; and *The First Cast* which were exhibited alongside nine other photographers from Hong Kong, America, Poland, China, Argentina and Hungary. The citation of the NYPS stated that the honour was “… the world’s highest tribute to a photographer”.

From 1966 to 1974, Yip was Vice-President of the Photographic Society of Singapore and on 15 December 1978, he was conferred Honorary Life Membership of the Society. He also served as Advisor of the Kreta Ayer Community Centre Camera Club from 1976 till his death in 1989.
