Pioneer architect William Lim died in January 2023 at the age of 90 after a long career in Singapore. He had helped shape the cityscape with a number of iconic
buildings that he had been involved in designing. These include the Singapore Conference Hall and Trade Union House (1965), People’s Park Complex (1973), Golden Mile Complex (1974) and Marine Parade Community Building (1999). In addition to being an architect, he was also active in urban conservation as well as the local arts scene.

Born in Hong Kong in 1932, Lim was a graduate of the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London where he was influenced by the Modernist movement, including Brutalism, an architectural style that is minimalist and emphasises materials, textures and construction. After graduating in 1955, he received a Fulbright scholarship to study in the Department of City and Regional Planning at Harvard University. He returned to Singapore and joined James Ferrie &amp; Partners in 1957.[^1]

In 1960, Lim left the firm and started Malayan Architects Co-Partnership (MAC) with architects Lim Chong Keat and Chen Voon Fee whom he had met while studying in the UK. Together, they introduced the Brutalist style to Singapore’s architecture through their work on the Singapore Conference Hall and Trade Union House (today’s Singapore Conference Hall, gazetted as a national monument in 2010) in 1965.[^2]

Following the dissolution of MAC in 1967, Lim co-founded Design Partnership (renamed DP Architects in 1975) with fellow pioneer architects Tay Kheng Soon and Koh Seow Chuan. The trio shaped Singapore’s skyline with more Brutalist pieces like People’s Park Complex (1973) and Woh Hup Complex (today’s Golden Mile Complex, gazetted in 2021).[^3]

In 1981, Lim left DP Architects and established William Lim Associates (WLA) with architects Mok Wei Wei, Richard Ho and Carl Larson. This period saw Lim embrace Postmodernism, an architectural style that appeared in the late 1970s in response to the philosophy and style of Modernism, which rejected ornamentation and emphasised minimalism. Postmodernism is notable for features such as curved forms, decorative elements and bright colours. This shift was reflected in projects such as Church of Our Saviour (1985), Yeo Hiap Seng Factory (1986), Tampines North Community Centre (1989) and Marine Parade Community Building (1999).

In 2003, the firm was renamed WArchitects following Lim’s retirement from practice. It is now helmed by Mok and Ng Weng Pan.[^4] 

Lim was also the author of numerous books such as <i>Alternative (Post)modernity</i> (2003), <i>Asian Alterity</i> (2008), <i>Incomplete Urbanism</i> (2012) and <i>Public Space in Urban Asia</i> (2014). He also edited architectural journals where he delved into diverse subjects, ranging from urban planning and architecture to broader topics like modernity, social justice and cultural identity.[^5] He was also deeply concerned about the conservation of Singapore’s architectural heritage.

Labelled by Mok as “an ‘enabler’ who brought talented people together to collaborate on meaningful projects”,[^6] Lim, together with other architects such as Mok and Richard Ho,[^7] restored several shophouses on Emerald Hill.

In 1982, Lim worked with Singaporean poet Goh Poh Seng on Bu Ye Tian (不夜天), a $52-million concept to rejuvenate, adapt and reuse the Boat Quay area. Bu Ye Tian, which means “a place of ceaseless activity” in Mandarin, called for the rejuvenation of the entire area into a cultural and recreation destination. Although it was not ultimately adopted by the Urban Redevelopment Authority, this initiative played a major role in accelerating the conservation movement in Singapore and later inspired the planning authorities’ conservation programme at Boat Quay in the 1990s.[^8]

In the local arts scene, Lim was a “thought leader and advocate of creativity and heritage”, a regular presence at arts events and a generous patron of various arts groups.[^9] In 2007, he helped establish the Cultural Studies in Asia PhD programme at the National University of Singapore with a S$1 million endowment.[^10] For his 80th birthday in 2012, Lim donated an undisclosed six-figure sum to various arts organisations. Beneficiaries included the Singapore Art Museum, Wild Rice, Arts Fission and two independent artists.[^11]

Lim’s legacy lives on through his works as well as the next generation whose lives he touched and inspired.
