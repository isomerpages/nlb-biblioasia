#### The early part of the 20th century saw a conservative shift towards the teaching of English to native subjects. This was contrary to the 19th century when the teaching of English was seen as an imperative civilising force – a tool for the enlightenment of the savage barbarians that the British ruled over in their colonies.

The early part of the 20th century saw a huge shift in colonial educational policy across the British Empire, with the beginnings of a strict limitation on teaching English to native subjects.

This starkly contrasted with previous attitudes within educational policy, where English would be taught - particularly in India - with the hope of "civilising" the natives. The English language in 19th century British imperial policy was conceived of as an imperative civilising force - a tool for the enlightenment of the savage barbarians the British ruled over in the tropical exploitation colonies.

In contrast, 20th century attitudes towards the teaching of English to natives grew more conservative. The growth and consolidation of the British Empire by the early 20th century showed how important" native education" was becoming to colonial governments as an ideological tool· but English education could be both an important implement as well as a highly dangerous one.

The problem with English was that if too many natives spoke it as well as Europeans and became as highly educated as Europeans, they would necessarily challenge European rule - particularly the race-based exclusions which prevented them from rising to higher levels of power within the colonial state machinery across the British Empire. English was thus used as a discretionary tool to both civilise and tame native subjects.

The bulk of this interpretation of British educational policy in colonial Malaya stems from an examination of a series of Malayan-centred textbooks produced in Malaya in the 1930s in order to create a more" Malayan-centred" education distinct from an English education, which only had English and European references at their core.

A symptomatic reading of these Malayan textbooks from the 1930s will show the engineering of an elite Englishspeaking sensibility across the different" native races·, or non-European races of Malaya - and is a way in which one can discern the ideological foundations of the Malayan "collaborative elite,· or a native bourgeoisie that would serve as the intermediaries between European colonials and the rest of the labouring colonised masses.

English in Malaya served as an instrument of power as it did within all British colonies. Used to separate master from servant, colonial from colonised, citizen and subject, it was a language of the elite, a language of the colonial state. The better one spoke English, the more one could rise up within the colonial state mechanisms - hence, the British also considered English education in Malaya dangerous because they were afraid that educating too many natives in English would threaten the security of their privileged position in Malaya.
