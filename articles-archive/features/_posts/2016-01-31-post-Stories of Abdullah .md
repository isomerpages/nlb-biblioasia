Quite ironically, the most detailed account of Stamford Raffles’ momentous arrival in Singapore was captured by a man who was not even there. Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir, better known as Munsyi Abdullah, gathered reports from those present to piece together a version of the events that occurred during Raffles’ first arrival to Singapore on 29 January 1819.1 This landmark narrative is included in his autobiography *Hikayat Abdullah*, or *Stories of Abdullah*, one of the most important records of the socio-political landscape in Singapore, Melaka and the southern Malay kingdoms of Johor and Riau-Lingga at the turn of the 19th century.

Written in Jawi – modified Arabic script used to write the Malay language – between 1840 and 1843 and published in 1849, the book is considered compulsory reading among scholars of Malay literature and culture and is the most renowned of Abdullah’s works.2 Until the 1970s, it was used as a textbook in every Malay school in Singapore.3

Born in Melaka in 1797, young Abdullah studied under the best Malay scholars in his hometown and read all the Malay manuscripts he could find. By the time he was 11, the child prodigy was already making money from writing Qur’anic texts and teaching religion to Indian soldiers stationed in Melaka. The soldiers called him “munsyi”, which means “teacher of language” – a title he would carry for the rest of his life. By 14, Abdullah had become an accomplished Malay scholar.4 He went on to teach Malay to some of the most eminent administrators, scholars and missionaries in the Straits of Melaka, including Raffles.5

As a scribe and interpreter for Raffles, and a Malay teacher to several English personages, Abdullah had a front-row seat to the political and cultural developments of the time. His perceptive insights, combined with a penchant for vivid descriptions, would give future readers of his book a rich picture of 19th-century life and personalities in Singapore and the region.6

Among other things, the *Hikayat* chronicles the three changes of the European guard in Melaka, the establishment of the British settlement in Singapore in 1819, 
Sultan Husain Shah’s brief rule during 
the early days of the settlement, and the 
eventual ceding of the island by the sultan 
and temenggung of Johor to the East India 
Company. The autobiography captures the 
breathless pace of Singapore’s development 
as a trading port under the British Empire, 
recounting the construction of new infrastructure, the boom in commerce, and the 
influx of immigrants that led to the island’s 
multi-racial population.7
Departing from the courtly tradition 
of Malay texts, Abdullah adopted a journalistic tenor that suited his forthright 
views. His passages are realistic and lively, 
incorporating many Malay idioms and 
proverbs.8
 The unusually conversational 
tone was inspired by the Sejarah Melayu 
(Malay Annals) (see page 47), a book about 
the history of the Melaka Sultanate in the 
15th and early 16th centuries. Abdullah had 
edited a version of Sejarah Melayu while
