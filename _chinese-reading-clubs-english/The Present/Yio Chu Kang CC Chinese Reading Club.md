**About**:	Our reading sessions commenced on 20 July 2009 with our inaugural session on the book "Oh! Xiangxue". We hold one reading session each month. During the pandemic, we switched to online sessions. Due to community centre renovations, we borrowed facilities at Ang Mo Kio Public Library. We participate in World Book Day reading activities every year and frequently invite authors to lead our reading sessions. These add variety to how we conduct our sessions.
