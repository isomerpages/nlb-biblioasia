#### **Shereen Tay** pores through the National Library’s collection of old primary school English textbooks, and uncovers some classics in the process.

“PETS!” exclaimed my friend in glee as she was combing through the National Library Board’s online catalogue. No, she was not referring to adorable cats or dogs but PETS (Primary English Thematic Series), the English textbooks used by primary school students in Singapore between 1991 and 1995.

The PETS textbooks were considered ahead of their time, a period that saw a considerable shift in the design and approach to teaching English in Singapore. What was so innovative about these textbooks? Was it the colourful pictorials, the lessons that revolved around themes, or the iconic animal mascot found in each series?

Sifting through the National Library’s Legal Deposit Collection of primary English textbooks gives one a sense of how the English curriculum and textbooks have evolved over the years. As I belong to the generation that grew up with PETS, I couldn’t help but feel a twinge of nostalgia when I stumbled upon these familiar textbooks of my formative years. 

#### **The Early English Textbooks**

Until the 1950s, English textbooks used in primary schools in Singapore were imported mainly from the United Kingdom. Among these were The Beacon Readers, Janet and John Basic Readers and First Aid in English. The British firmly believed that Malayan students in local schools should be taught English exactly the same way as students back home in England.

While such imported textbooks were helpful tools – given the absence of viable alternatives – in teaching English to Asian students, they also suffered from serious shortcomings. Not only were foreign books unsuitable for the local population who had little or no knowledge of the English language, they also imparted ideas and values that were incompatible with life in Singapore.
