<h4><strong>From Desker Road to Xilin Avenue, street signs around Singapore recall the lives of people whose stories are a part of the nation’s history.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<hr>
<p>Being in a war zone is always dangerous, even for non-combatants, as R.B.
Ooi, the former editor for the <em>Singapore Standard</em> and the <em>Eastern Sun</em> could
attest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the Malayan Emergency (1948–60), Ooi worked as a press officer
to General Gerald Templer, the British High Commissioner for Malaya, who
had been tasked to deal with the communist guerillas. In a 1969 letter
to his daughter, Irene Lim, Ooi wrote that he had spent three years “covering
the jungle war for the government, local and foreign press…” That meant
spending time with British troops in the jungle. And while they tried not
to draw attention, apparently, the communists knew they were there. Ooi
further wrote that a surrendered Malay communist had come up to him and
asked what they had been doing in the jungle near Bentong, Pahang, with
a Gurkha patrol. “He and his men were waiting to ambush the Gurkhas when
he saw us following the Gurkhas in thick jungle with film camera and still
camera. He thought we were from Hollywood, so did not shoot…”<a href="#_ftn1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[1]</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ooi also had to worry about being shot by the British as well. “Once I
was sent to the jungle to study the morale of British troops. Those young
soldiers were scared stiff when they entered a rubber estate. One of them
tripped over a wire and set off an alarm in a hill. The soldiers ran up
the hill firing like mad and so we had to run with them or else we might
be fired upon by both sides…&nbsp; Those were dangerous years for me and
two of my cameramen colleagues. I should have got an OBE [The Most Excellent
Order of the British Empire] for that.”<a href="#_ftn2" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[2]</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>R.B. Ooi, born Ooi Chor Hooi (1905–72), was my maternal grandfather. He
was one of the earliest local Malayan journalists writing in English and
had worked for newspapers from the <em>Straits Echo</em> to the <em>Malayan Times</em>.
In 2023, Irene Lim – his daughter and my mother – donated his personal
papers and photos to the National Library of Singapore. These are now held
in the R.B. Ooi and Edna Kung Collection. His writings give us a window
into discourses – such as multiculturalism and the Malayan identity – that
publicly preoccupied the English-educated in the colonial and immediate
post-colonial periods in Singapore and Malaysia.</p>
