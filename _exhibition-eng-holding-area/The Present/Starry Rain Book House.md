**About**:	Through guided reading sessions led by tertiary students, we bring together teenagers aged 13 to 17 who are interested in Chinese literature. By reading and reflecting on texts together, participants explore life topics, learn alongside their peers, and maintain their passion for Chinese books. We welcome secondary school students who enjoy reading Chinese books and participating in discussions to join our guided sessions, make friends through literature, and embark on journeys of discovery!
