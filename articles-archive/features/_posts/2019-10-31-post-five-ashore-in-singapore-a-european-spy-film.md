#### **Raphaël Millet** sits through a B-grade movie dismissed by critics as belonging to the genre of Eurospy flicks that parody James Bond – and discovers a slice of Singaporean celluloid history.

Few foreign films, especially Western ones, have ever been shot completely on location in Singapore. In the latter half of the 1960s, a handful of low-budget commercial European films – or B-grade movies, to borrow a term from the film industry – were produced with the Lion City as an exotic backdrop. These “Eurospy films”, a variation of the broader “super spy” genre, were obvious rip-offs of the James Bond series by Ian Fleming and were especially popular in Germany, Italy, France and Spain. When the first Bond movie Dr No was released in 1962, it was swiftly followed up by a string of copycat European films based on Secret Agent 007.

The “super spy” craze peaked between 1966 and 1968 and included a few shot-in-Singapore films like *So Darling So Deadly* (1966),1 *Suicide Mission to Singapore* (1966)2 and *Five Ashore in Singapore* (1967). Apart from rare mentions in articles or books,3 Precious little has been written about these films, even though they all captured Singapore at a time of change in the first few months or years following its independence in 1965. Of these three films, the most outstanding is *Five Ashore in Singapore*.

#### **OSS 117, the “French Bond”**

*Five Ashore in Singapore* (see text box) was a French-Italian collaboration between producers Pierre Kalfon and Georges Chappedelaine of Les Films Number One in Paris, and Franco Riganti and Antonio Cervi of Franco Riganti Productions in Rome. The international distribution of the film was handled by Rank Organisation, a British conglomerate created in the late 1930s.

Two versions of the film were produced simultaneously: one in English and the other in French, which is why the producers took pains to cast as many actors as possible who were bilingual so that they could play their parts in both languages. Only the few main actors who were not conversant in French had to be dubbed along with all the Singaporean extras.

<div style="background-color: white;"><i>Five Ashore in Singapore</i> is the film adaptation of the 1959 French novel, <i>Cinq gars pour Singapour</i>, by the prolific French writer Jean Bruce. Literally translated as “Five Guys for Singapore”, the title is a clever pun on the name of the city because <i>cinq-gars-pour</i>, when said quickly, sounds exactly like “Singapour”. Pictured here is the cover of the first edition of the book published by Presses de la Cité in 1959. <i>Courtesy of Raphaël Millet.</i></div>
