<p>This book contains 50 specially curated items from the Rare Materials Collection, researched and written by a team of librarians from the National Library. Each article in this book contains a detailed description of the rare item as well as highlights of its history and provenance. Distilling 50 items from a 19,000-strong collection was a challenging task, and the final selection is at best only a representative snapshot of the complete repository.
