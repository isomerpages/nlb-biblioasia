---
#### Built at a cost of $1.5 billion, Changi Airport was the largest public project in Singapore when it was completed in 1981. Learn more about Changi Airport through photos.

Before the airport became operational on 1 July that year, it was opened to an eager public. Tours were sold out, and by mid-June, the airport had received more than 250,000 visitors, about a tenth of Singapore’s population. Clearly Changi Airport had captured public imagination.[^1]  

#### **Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew's Role**

Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew was instrumental in the making of Changi Airport. In 1975, he decided to build a new airport at Changi on a site five times larger than the Paya Lebar Airport, going against the recommendations of consultants. The cost of relocation to Changi excluded the sunk cost of $800 million invested in the Paya Lebar airport.[^2]    
	
Lee took a great interest in the building of Changi Airport. To see where the extension of the first runway would be, he got on a military passenger transport plane to get a birds-eye view of the entire construction site.[^3]  
	
	
#### **Communications Equipment**

M. Lap, chairman of Philips Singapore. <i>Ministry of Information and the Arts Collection, courtesy of National Archives of Singapore</i>.</div>
	
On 17 February 1977, the Singapore government signed a S$19 million contract with Philips, for the supply of long-range radar and display system (LORADS). 

LORADS was designed to guide 250 aircrafts simultaneously—whether they are landing, taking off or flying—within the controlled airspace about 20 km in height and spanning more than 320 km. It was part of the S$100 million navigational system planned for the new airport, which was positioned to be the region’s air communications hub.[^4]  
 
	
#### **Passenger Terminal Building**

The S$268 million five-storey passenger terminal building was built to handle 10 million passengers a year and was the largest in the entire airport complex. Underneath the H-shaped passenger terminal building is Singapore’s first underground bus terminal.

Before construction of this passenger terminal building was even completed, in 1980 the government was already looking into building a second one to expand the capacity of Changi airport as 17 million passengers were estimated to pass through the airport by 1989.[^5]  

	
#### **A Matter of National Pride**

Changi Airport was to become a symbol of national pride. Two years before the airport became operational, it was featured on the reverse side of the new $20 note, with Concorde, the first supersonic passenger aircraft, in the foreground. The $20 note was introduced on 6 August 1979 as part of the bird series.[^6]  



#### **Aerobridges**

The aerobridge is one of the features of Changi Airport not available at Paya Lebar. Aerobridges allow passengers to board planes from the terminal building rather than having to take a bus and climb a flight of mobile steps. Changi Airport was one of the first few airports in the world to use the aerobridge.[^7]

The aerobridge is commonplace now. But in 1981, a journalist reporting on her tour of the Changi Airport remarked that the highlight of the tour was “troop[ing] down an aerobridge”.[^8]


#### **The Second Runway**

The construction of the 3,355-metre second runway was part of Changi Airport’s phase two development, which would include the construction of a second passenger terminal building. Despite being shorter than the first runway, the second runway cost 30 percent more to be built, because of inflation. The second runway was built on almost entirely reclaimed land and became operational in February 1984.[^9]


#### **The Iconic Control Tower**

The design of the iconic 78-metre tall octagonal control tower came from a design competition held among architects of the Public Works Department. It was built at a cost of S$8.4 million, while the building of the taxiway cost S$15 million. In 1985, these two structures won awards from the American Concrete Institute for the creative use of concrete in design.[^10]

The video below shows the radome (the dome-like structure on top of the control tower) and the radar equipment inside it being replaced in 2015.
