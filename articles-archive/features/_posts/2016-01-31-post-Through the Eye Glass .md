<div style="background-color: white;">In <i>Cermin Mata</i>, the lithography technique was used for the first time to print Jawi text that closely resembled the natural flow of the handwritten script.

The journal *Cermin Mata Bagi Segala Orang Yang Menuntut Pengetahuan* is among the earliest Malay serial publications existing today. Translated literally as An “Eye Glass for All Who Seek Knowledge”, it was one of the most ambitious and voluminous of all 19th-century missionary journals printed in Malaya.1 Seven issues of *Cermin Mata* in Jawi – the modified Arab script used to 
write the Malay language – were produced as quarterly publications beginning from April 1858. Each issue contains 100 pages and comes with elaborate, coloured frontispieces and chapter headings.

The man behind *Cermin Mata* was Reverend Benjamin Keasberry, a Protestant missionary who moved to Singapore in 1839 when he saw the potential for doing missionary work among the Malays while assisting at the Mission Press.

Established by Christian missionaries in 1823, Mission Press is the first printing press established in Singapore. The press was specifically set up to print Christian literature that had been translated into various languages for distribution throughout the region. When the London 
Missionary Society ceased operations in Singapore in 1846, Keasberry decided to remain behind. Having learnt the art of printing in Batavia (present-day Jakarta), he took over the operations of the press and ran it as a commercial enterprise to support his family while running a school for Malay boys.2

Keasberry translated numerous 
English works into Malay, many of which 
supported the proselytising works of 
Christian missionaries. These ranged 
from books of the Bible such as Genesis 
and Psalms to literature on Jesus and 
other biblical characters. He was also 
known as a printer and publisher of textbooks for use in mission schools. Some 
of these textbooks were translated into 
Malay by Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir (also 
known as Munsyi Abdullah).3
 Abdullah, a 
devout Muslim of Arab-Indian heritage, 
collaborated with Keasberry on various 
publications as copyist, writer, language 
editor, translator and printer.4
Keasberry met Abdullah in the late 
1830s, when the latter was engaged to 
help him refine his Malay-language skills. 
The collaboration between Abdullah and 
Keasberry produced several beautifully 
decorated multi-coloured lithographs of 
fine manuscripts. 
Keasberry’s boarding school for boys 
was set on a hill he had acquired in 1848 
at River Valley Road, which he renamed 
Mount Zion. His students were taught 
English and Malay as well as skills such 
as printing, lithography, bookbinding and

compositors’ work in both English and 
Malay type.5
 Mount Zion (or Bukit Zion) was 
also the location of the press.
Keasberry compiled two periodicals 
before he published Cermin Mata: namely 
Taman Pengetahuan (1848–52) and Pŭngutib 
Sagala Remah Pengetahuan (1852–54). 
Similar in content to Cermin Mata, these 
works consisted of a mix of Christian biblical 
and other moral stories as well as practical 
knowledge and science.6
 However of the 
three periodicals, the finest was Cermin 
Mata – which has been called “a most 
spectacular imprint”.7
Cermin Mata was used as an educational magazine and a means of proselytising 
in missionary schools. It was also used as 
reading material in the Dutch education 
system in Indonesia (after Dutch official 
Palmer van den Broek compiled parts of 
it as an anthology).8
 This version in romanised text, or Rumi, was printed in 1866 
in Batavia, followed by a Javanese version 
that was printed in 1877 in Semarang.9
 A 
literal translation of the chapter titles from 
issues 5 and 6 shows interesting and varied content, with chapters such as “Tears 
of a Friend”, “Travels in Africa”, “About 
Sheep”, “Economics”, “Napoleon’s Army 
in Russia”, “Sailing Around the World” and 
“Robinson Crusoe”.10
Keasberry’s body of work was an 
important development for the Malay printing 
industry. He used the lithography technique 
to print Jawi text that resembled the natural 
flow of the handwritten script. Cermin Mata
