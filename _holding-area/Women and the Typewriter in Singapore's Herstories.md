#### The humble typewriter helped women become better educated, enter the workforce and contribute to society. 

Mechanical to electric, manual to automated, ubiquitous to ornamental. Since it first entered commercial production in the 1870s, what is now seen as the humble typewriter has played a significant role in the history of the 20th century. Less well known is the fact that the typewriter was also a key force in shaping herstory in the same period. Women’s progress through the formal economy has been closely intertwined with the typewriter. Women typists, stenographers and secretaries bore witness to the technological, socio-economic and political changes from the 1900s to the tumultuous 1950s, and later the “electrifying” 1970s.

#### **Women Typists in Prewar Singapore**

In colonial Malaya, advertisements for typewriters began appearing in English-language broadsheets from the late 1890s.[^1] In the early days, companies in Malaya did not seem to hire many female typists. A letter to the _Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser_ in 1908 notes that the “lady shorthand typist is a rare personage within the walls of commercial houses”, reflecting the general absence of women in this emerging trade.[^2]

Female literacy rate was low in Singapore in the prewar period and women’s employment was largely confined to the informal sector.[^3] However, as attitudes toward women’s education changed, interest in secretarial skills like shorthand and typing became heightened. As M.R. Menon, the principal of the Young Men’s Christian Association’s (YMCA) School of Commerce, noted: “With the social advancement of womanhood, the Chinese girl labours under no false modesty. She is no longer content to sweep the floor and open the windows of the house and to do the cooking. Education has fired her with an ambition to do something.”[^4] The typewriter was to be part of the education and progress of women.

Shorthand and typing courses continued even during the period of the Japanese Occupation of Singapore (1942–45). Among the propaganda showcases were initiatives encouraging the progress of women through typewriting courses. Accounts in the English-language _Syonan Shimbun_ (the newspaper that replaced the _Straits Times_ during the occupation years) featured local Malay women undertaking typing courses as well as the introduction of the Kanji typewriter (which uses traditional Chinese characters).[^5]

#### **The Tumultuous 50s**

Demand for typewriters grew significantly after the war. The trend started from the disruption of women’s education during the occupation years when many found themselves either too old or economically disadvantaged to continue with their education. Instead, these women attended commercial classes like typewriting and shorthand.[^6] Jobs that required such skills saw acute demand with the reestablishment of the civil service after the war.[^7]

Just the ability to type alone was not always valued by employers though. In April 1953, there was a salary dispute played out in the Industrial Arbitration Court between the Singapore Government Administrative and Clerical Services Union and the Singapore Post and Telegraph Workers’ Union (SPTWU), and the Telecommunications Department. One of the key points of contention was the call for women teleprinter operators to receive the same salary as women postal clerks.[^8]

Teleprinters were introduced in 1932 in the postal offices of Malaya – a milestone in communication technology.[^9] Also known as “typewriting by wire”, teleprinting entailed telegraphic instruments receiving printed messages via telephone cables and radio relay systems. The Posts and Telegraphs Department had affered teleprinter work to women typists “as an experiment” and “‘a different kind of job’ for the fair sex”.[^10]

When pressed to increase the salary scale of teleprinters to that of clerks, the Telecommunications Department attempted to devalue the responsibilities of its 35 women teleprinter operators by claiming that they had engaged in frivolous tele-conversations with male pilots. When cross-examined by the union’s legal representative Lee Kuan Yew, the assistant controller of the Telecommunications Department, J. Metcalfe-Moore, said that his female workers had voluntarily taken on duties on long-range radio communication. He added: “The girls like talking to the pilots and the pilots like talking to them.”[^11] The court eventually ruled in favour of the teleprinter typists, and reduced the time to attain the maximum salary from 21 years to 17.[^12]
