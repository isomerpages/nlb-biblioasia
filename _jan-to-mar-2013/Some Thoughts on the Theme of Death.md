title: Some Thoughts on the Theme of Death
permalink: /vol-8/issue-4/Jan-Mar-2013/theme-death/
description: "Family and friends have long had to bear with my vocal thoughts on
  endless scenes of wasted death on the news. My emotive views come from what I
  assumed were my limitless powers of empathy. As I have read and watched the
  news from the comfort of a warm home in a peaceful Singapore, I thought I
  fully understood the pain of a husband weeping over a wife killed by
  cross-fire or a grieving mother whose child lay limp due to famine caused by
  manâ€™s disregard for fellowman. My self-delusion ended only recently. "
