To the early naturalist, the mere mention of Malay Archipelago conjures up images of amazing rare things and nature’s paradise. Interest in natural history in this region corresponded with the energetic intellectual climate in early modern Europe. During the 17th century, the term *natural history illustration* came into use as artists created
images of plants and animals for documentation and study. Many European ships set sail for journeys of discovery
during that period. The travelling naturalists responded to the flora and fauna and to the landscapes, in which they worked.

Rendering the nature’s elegance and beauty has a long history. Dating as early as 30,000 years ago, the oldest "scientific” records can be seen from the French caves.
Pictures of ancient Egyptians sacrifice and Leonardo da Vinci’s sketches of human bodies are notable forms of early scientific drawing. There are also vivid descriptions of
exotic flowers in the South East Asia including the Rafflesia arnoldi, the world’s largest flower and the Orchideous plant,
discovered by Sir Stamford Raffles.

#### **Painting on Cave Walls**

Primitive men are credited with painting on cave walls at Lascaux in France, long before civilisation. Animal figures such as the horses, bison, rhinoceroses, lions, buffalo
and mammoth have been seen. These amazingly accurate drawings seem to indicate that the observers had studied the subject intensely and reproduced the images from memory in dimly lit caves. The meaning and purpose of cave paintings are complicated and varied. Some images record mythological stories, sorcery, fertility and rituals, while others depict hunting scenes. It was believed that drawing a particular animal would invoke the species to propagate and the ritual act of painting or touching these depictions would release
sacred energy or power. Visual aids such as arrows have also been seen next to some drawings and could have been used to train
the young cave dwellers.

Animals played a big part in the lives of the early cultures. They are among the first drawings that human depicted. Various art forms have shown animals in their symbolising power and influences. There are certain degrees of similarity among these animal portrayals. Most animals are shown in broadside view to provide the most information. Birds, quadrupeds and fishes show their most salient characteristics from the side whereas insects and arthropods reveal most of theirs when seen from above.

#### **Tomb Murals and Greek Pottery**

The ancient Egyptians
(5000–300 BC) lived
on high ground along
the banks of the Nile
River and were cattle-
raisers or farmers.
Drawings on buildings,
sculptures, papyri, coffins
and burial tombs
revealed the rich tapestry
of Egyptians’ relationship
with nature
and their beliefs, such
as "life after death”.
One famous depiction
showing a person’s
judgment of the afterlife
is the *Weighing of the Heart*, where the jackal-headed god *Anubis* is weighing
the heart of a priestess. The scale illustrates one example of "ancient technology”.

Ancient Greek (1500–31 BC) was particularly famous
for their vases, sculptures and architecture. Early portrayal
of "scientific apparatus” of the era has shown transport,
hunting tools and techniques of weaving cloths. This period
also marked the beginning of humans and monumental
stone sculptures. Human statutes are heroically proportioned
due to Greek humanistic belief in the nobility of
man. By the time Alexander the Great died at 323 BC, the
Greek sculptors had mastered carving marbles and were
technically perfect. They
sculpted heroic human
figures that still remain
popular today.

#### **Chinese Animal Motif and the Mughal Painting**

their work. Woodstock, N.Y.: Overlook Press.
</i></div>

Chinese arts are greatly
influenced by nature.
Painting of birds, flowers,
and landscapes
from the countryside
were popular. The earliest
images of animals
are produced during the
Shang Dynasty (1523–1028 BC). Animal
motifs such as cicada,
owl, bear, rabbit, deer, even tapir and Indian rhinoceros are carved in jade or cast
in bronze. Two and more animals are often combined in
a single artwork, representing the "metamorphosis of one
animal into another”. Animals are not the subjects of interest
as living creatures but are for aesthetic and decorative
purposes. The Chinese also like to depict animals with symbolic
meaning. For example, fantasy animals such as dragon
and phoenix with flames (symbolising power) streaming
from their bodies and cranes and zodiac animals (symbolising
long life).

<img src="/images/Vol%204%20Issue%201/EyesNature/capture1.jpg" style="width:100%;">

Graphic art started after paper was invented in AD 105.
Although no painting on paper survived from the early Han
period (206 BC–220 AD), stylised animal pictures preserved
on damask and other textiles are found. Chinese ceramics
such as those in Tang Dynasty (AD 600–
900) achieved its
finest artistic standard; for example, the standing figures of
spirited horses.

Hunting scenes, common in many prehistoric illustrations
are also found in India. Religious life of the Hindus (namely
Buddhism and Hinduism) greatly influences the Indian arts.
Human figures are glorified and most animal representations
(elephants and cattle are fairly common) are sculpted in
stones.

Realistic and detailed paintings came about from the
16th century. Monarchs at the time, such as Akbar the Great
and his son, Jahangir were very passionate about painting
and the natural world. The Mughal School of painting came
into being. One famous artist, Mansur was known as the
"painter of flora and fauna”. He travelled with the emperor and created famous images of zebra, neelgai (a kind of
deer) and a variety of birds.

#### **Artists as Scientists from Early Modern Europe**

Around 1400, artists in Europe began to produce more
"realistic” or "naturalistic” style of drawing. During this
period, scholars were increasingly interested to study, collect
and classify living things. Many captivating drawings are
produced and used as identification aids, religious symbols
and philosophical ideas or purely for art appreciation. Over
the next two centuries, this new approach to nature came
to be known as "scientific illustration”.

A man of "both worlds”, Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) was an artist, scientist, engineer and inventor. He
would dissect corpses and record everything he found in his
journals. His images of animals, plants and human bodies
are results of careful observation of natural structures,
forms and compositions.

One of the greatest painter-naturalists of her time was
Maria Sibylla Merian (1647–1717). She created beautiful
visual images of flowers and insects and her observations
revolutionised the science of animals and plants. Her works
are rich with tropical flowers and fruit, insects of all kinds,
especially exotic butterflies, moths and caterpillars.

Another well-known water-colourist, naturalist and
adventurer whose name is synonymous with bird and nature
lover and environmentalist was John James Audubon (1785–1851). His passion for birds resulted in a seven-volume
edition of *The Birds of America* describing the anatomy, habits and localities of the birds with 500
hand-coloured lithographs.

For centuries, artists have worked closely
with the "natural scientists”. Andreas Vesalius
(1514–1564) worked with artist, Jan van
Calcar in the seven-volume, revolutionary
human anatomy textbook, *De humani corporis
fabrica*. Woodcut designer, Hans Weiditz and
botanist, Otto Brunfels (1488–1534) produced
stunning plant studies in *Herbarium vivae
eicone*s. A team of craftsmen and Leonhard
Fuchs (1501–1566) who was a physician and
botanist, created the early printed herbals, *De
historia stipium*.

Voyages and journeys of exploration
became common in early modern Europe.
These ships travelled around the world in
search of scientific discovery. Skilled artists
usually went along and produced amazingly
illustrated botanical and natural history books.
English painter, Augustus Earle (1793–1838)
embarked with Charles Darwin (1809–1882)
in one of the world most famous expedition,
HMS Beagle. Darwin had no artistic flair and
depended on Earle to illustrate the materials
that he collected both at sea and ashore.

#### **Fusion of Western and Eastern Natural**

Shortly before the 19th century, the British East
India Company began to explore Asia. Great
numbers of its staff moved from England in
search of new trading ports.

In India, these newcomers who have
arrived on the exotic land were fascinated by
what they saw. They purchased paintings that
depicted daily life, important monuments and
local flora and fauna. Indian artists were quick
to offer what these new patrons wanted.
They modified traditional techniques to suit
Western tastes. The resulting hybrid of Indian
and European styles and painting techniques
came to be known as the "Company
Painting”.

things: The art of natural history in the age of discovery. London: Royal Collection.</i></div>

Calcutta (Kolkata) was the oldest trade
houses of the East India Company. It was also an early
production centre for natural history paintings. The city’s
enthusiastic patrons include Marquis Wellesley, governor-general
from 1798 to 1805 and Major-General Thomas
Hardwicke of the Bengal Artillery (1755–1835). Both men
collected large menageries and hired artists to paint the birds and animals and other specimens they acquired. A
Company-established botanical garden in Calcutta also
undertook similar project for the plant samples it had
collected.

Another influential painting centre was in Madras where
Lord Clive, eldest son of Robert Clive was stationed. While
in the army, Lord Clive, a naturalist devoted his time to pursue his interest and produced several volumes of natural
history paintings from South India.

European traders have also enjoyed access to China in
the late 17th century. Like the Indian counterparts, Chinese
artists who worked at the foreign settlement at Canton
(Guangzhou), were quick to adapt their talent to produce
detailed botanical paintings that suited the Western clients.

detailed botanical paintings that suited the Western clients.
China has a well-established system of modular painting
techniques. *The Mustard Seed Garden Manual of Painting*
(Chieh Tzu Yuan Hua Chuan) is one of the greatest
manuals on painting. It gives hundreds of examples of the
brushstroke forms, ranging from single stroke of a blade
of grass or flower petal to the composition of a tree,
village and mountain. These superior examples explain
the principles and standards of painting. An artist could
creatively combine each module in different ways with
almost limitless variation in his work. This also explains why
the Chinese artists could adapt their skills easily to create
botanical drawings to meet the export markets.

#### **Early Naturalists in the Malay Peninsula**

The East India Company has one of the largest natural history
drawings. They realised the economic and scientific value
of plant and animal products. Thus, overseas officials were
encouraged to pursue their interests in natural history.

After the British conquest of Java in 1811, Stamford
Raffles (1781–1826) was promoted to become the lieutenant
governor. In 1819, he founded Singapore by purchasing
the land for the British East India Company. Raffles was
an enthusiastic natural historian. While travelling on his assignments, he encountered the unusual natural and
stunning landscapes. Raffles hastened to collect and record
the images of the objects he found with proper scientific
data. This resulted in a plethora of dried plants and insects,
skins of birds and animals, shells and minerals and a series
of their paintings by Chinese painters.

Raffles would carefully organise and dispatch crates
of specimens back to England. However, few of these
collections have survived and these are now preserved at the
British Museum. A fire broke out and destroyed everything
that he had collected on his boat when he left Sumatra for
home in 1824.

A friend of Raffles, William Marsden (1754–1836) who
was stationed in Bencoolen in Sumatras has a broad interest
in the local history, cultures and language. He was also keen
in natural history and frequently wrote to British scientists.
Marsden was a source for many of our most precious
botanical and zoological drawings from his time.

William Farquhar (1770–1839) has long been associated
with Stamford Raffles. He was the first British Resident and
Commandant of Singapore in 1819. He was also a naturalist
and passionate investigator. While in Melaka (Malacca) from
1795 to 1818, Farquhar employed the locals to collect and
preserve the specimens and commissioned Chinese artists to
paint them. The paintings show a charming combination of
traditional Chinese painting aesthetics and a high standard
of scientific detail. He would send the drawings, detailed
descriptions, bones, preserved specimen, particularly
unknown foreign species to the attention of museums,
botanic gardens and naturalists. He made many important zoological discoveries, among them the Malayan tapir,
binturong, banded linsang, bamboo rat and moonrat.

<img src="/images/Vol%204%20Issue%201/EyesNature/flowers3.jpg" style="width:100%;">

Farquhar brought his collection of drawings with him
to Singapore and from there to London. He presented the
collection to the Royal Asiatic Society (RAS) in 1827. Mr Goh
Geok Khim, a stockbroker by profession and a nature lover,
acquired the entire collection of watercolour painting in an
auction in 1993. He officially donated it to the Singapore
History Museum in 1996.

The person, who shared Darwin’s
discovery of evolution was Alfred
Russel Wallace (1823–
1913). Wallace made
extensive trips to the
Amazon River basin
and then the Malay
Archipelago.
He arrived in the
East in 1854 as an
experienced collector
and never
lost his excitement
at seeing new
things and making
new discoveries.
More than
125,000 specimens
(including 80,000
beetles alone) were
collected in the Malay
Peninsula. During
the field trips he observed
the differences
between animals
in Asia and those
in Australia. Delicate
pencil sketches and drawings of those newly discovered
species were among Wallace’s collection.

#### **Uses of Art in the Service of Science**

Prehistoric men communicated their religion, law and
history through painting and carving long before written
language was developed. Various art forms, including song,
dance and storytelling were not merely used for ceremonial
performance or enjoyment but as a mean of recording
ideas and values.

From the Lascaux cave art of France, through Merian’s
secrets of insect metamorphosis to Leonardo’s anatomical
studies, pictures and diagrams have made learning science
more interesting and meaningful than text alone can
provide. Natural history drawings also reveal the natural environment of our rich past and present in a creative way.

Drawing and painting plants are among the earliest
uses of art for scientific purposes. The Greek physician,
Pedanius Dioscorides who was born in the first century AD,
compiled *De materia medica*. He showed vividly how drugs
were prepared from plants and their chemical properties. It
became the most central pharmacological work in Europe
and the Middle East.

Exotic objects were collected from the Western ships
coming back from the New World—Asia,
Middle East and Africa. These
were kept in "cabinets of curiosities”
and became the forerunners
of modern museums.
Famous collectors include
the "greatest naturalist of
his times”, Conrad Gessner
(1516–1565) and
Ulisse Aldrovandi (1522–1605) who organised
numerous excursions
to Italian mountains,
countryside, islands and
coasts in order to collect
and catalogue plants.

The 18th century witnessed
infectious interest
in the study of natural history
among the amateurs
and scientists. It became part
of liberal education among
men and women. It was
also the golden age of
Carl Linnaeus (1707–1778).
He was curious about the
natural world and wanted
to "bring order to nature”. He went on to name, rank,
and classify the living things using his naming convention
known as the "binary nomenclature”, which is still widely
used today. Natural history drawing has been important
in showing the general characteristics of the species
such as shapes and colours and is essential for systematic
classification.

Charles Darwin kept many specimens during his amazing
journey aboard the *Beagle* where he made observations
that led to his revolutionary theory of natural selection. His
book, *On the Origin of Species* became a pivotal work in
the scientific literature. Another famous expedition, the
*Challenger* of 1874 witnessed the birth of oceanography,
as it is known today. Among the new discoveries made, the
expedition catalogued 4,000 previously unknown species of animals. These specimens were examined, identified and
drawn. The expedition also reflected a deep collaboration
among natural historians, ocean specialists and artists.

#### **Conclusion**

The wonder and beauty of nature has been richly
documented for thousands of years. Delineation of the
living world reaches its heightened accuracy in the late 18th
century when advanced printing methods such as stipple
engraving and lithography were used. The creators of
natural history drawings often find the field an ideal fusion of interests in art and science. As Wilfrid Blunt expounded,
"The greatest flower painters are those who have understood
plants scientifically, but have yet seen and described them
with the eyes and the hand of the artist.” Blunt (1994).
