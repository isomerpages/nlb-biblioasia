**About**:	3G Reading Club was established in 2006 by a dedicated group of Singapore Chinese language teachers with the mission of promoting reading culture, enhancing spiritual literacy, and strengthening cultural identity within the community. The name "3G" carries profound symbolic meaning, representing the relay and inheritance across three generations of educators who have committed themselves to preserving and advancing Chinese educational traditions. The club's activities centre on comprehensive book discussions that delve deeply into carefully selected texts spanning Chinese and foreign classics, local literature, and educational works. These sessions are designed to guide participants on a transformative journey from passive reading to active thinking, fostering the development of critical analytical skills and practical application of literary insights.
