#### A major site of intra-Asia trade between India and China, Malacca was also an important site in European expansion into Asia. Lee Kong Chian Research Fellow _Katrina Gulliver_ examines the importance of Malacca to Europe, and how the city developed with European influence.

Malacca was controlled by European powers for more than 400 years – by the Portuguese in 1511, the Dutch in 1641, and the British, first temporarily in 1795, then from 1824 as part of the Anglo-Dutch Treaty, in which the city was exchanged for Bengkulu in Sumatra.

Malacca held an important role in the European expansionist imagination. Tomé Pires said: “Whoever is lord of Malacca has his hand on the throat of Venice”. English texts from the 16th century onwards demonstrate a desire to capture the port, and the cultural position its name held as a symbol of wealth and the exotic. This paper looks at how Malacca was used, and how it demonstrates changing attitudes towards colonisation and the idea of the city.

Malacca was an important site in European expansion into Asia. In the 15th century, the city was a crucial nexus of a trade network from the Moluccas to Venice. Being at the “end of the monsoon”, it served as a major site for intra-Asia trade between China and India. I have chosen to look at the city from a different angle, in examining how important Malacca was to Europe, and how the city developed with European influence.

#### **European Perceptions of the City**

The term Golden Khersonese (or Chersonese) appears in Ptolemy’s geography, referring to what was later confirmed to be the Malay Peninsula. 1 This term was in use during the early modern period in Europe to refer more specifically to the region, and in a more vague, mythical sense as a site of treasure. During the late 15th century, the city of Malacca came to be known in Europe, and references to it began to appear in literature.

During Portuguese control of the city, the references became more common, both in factual references and literature. I am limiting my references to printed works that would have been available to a broader audience than unpublished manuscripts. Gasparo Balbi’s *Viaggio dell’Indie Orientali*, published in Venice in 1590, described Malacca’s location and what could be bought there (*sandoli*, *pocellane*: sandalwood and porcelain, p.64), and detailed the dates of the monsoon season between Goa and Malacca. 2

The overlap in usage between Malacca and Golden Chersonese is discussed in this 1604 text:

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*“Is it not easie to find Molaco in ancient bookes, which*<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*they called the golden Chersonese: the Cape of Comori,* <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*which was called the Promontorie of Coci; & that great &* <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*famous Iland of Sumatra, so well knowne by the ancient*<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<br>*name of Taprobana.”* 3

The “great & famous illand” description also demonstrates a growing level of assumed knowledge in Europe about the East Indies, and how much they had even by this stage (the English East India Company’s first mission was in 1601) become part of the mental map projected from Europe.

A more detailed description of Malacca was given by Pierre d’Avity, translated into English in 1615:

“*Malaca is seated upon the river of Gaza, and is a good* <br>  *faire Towne, having in circuit neere twentie miles. The* <br>  *originarie or first inhabitants of this place report, that the* <br>  *beginning came of six or seven fishermen, which came to* <br> *dwell there, but their number increased, by the arrivall of* <br>  *other fishermen of Siam, Pegu, and Bengola, who built a* <br>  *towne, and framed a particular language, taking all the* <br>  *best kind of speech from other nations. They named their* <br>  *towne Malaca, which is growne so rich and mightie in a* <br>  *short time by reason of her situation, as she contends* <br>  *for precedence with the greatest townes, yea with some* <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; *realmes thereabouts*. <br>  *The Countrie people sleepe upon trees for feare of* <br>  *Tygers, whereof there are so many as they will come* <br>  *into the towne for a prey. The Portugals who tooke this* <br>  *towne from a king of the Moores, found the scituation so* <br>  *commodious, as they have made it in a manner the Center* <br>*of all the merchandise and trafficke of the East, and the*<br> *head of a kingdome, which extends from Sincapura to*<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*Pullo, and Cambilan*;” 4

Here we see two elements emerging in the description: One is the wealth and success of the town, and the other its position as a central gathering place for traders from different regions, as what might be termed proto-multiculturalism.

In Portuguese literature (the city is mentioned in the *Lusiad*, of 1572, an epic poem by Luis Vaz de Camoes, depicting Portuguese history and the events of the discovery of India as blessed by mythological figures) demonstrating even at this stage its role — and that of colonialism in general — in Portuguese national culture.

Malacca is mentioned in Book X, verse 44:
Nor *Him* shalt *Thou* (though potent) scape, and flye, <br>  (Though sheltred in the Bosome of the *Morn*)  <br> MALACCA (and the Apple of her Eye) <br>  Prowd of thy wealthy Dow’r as her *first-born*. <br>  Thy *poyson’d Arrows*, those *Auxiliary*  <br> CRYSES I see (thy *Pay* That do not scorn) <br>  MALACCANS amorous, valiant JAVANS, <br>  Shall all obey the LUSITANIANS.

And verse 57:

Great *Actions* in the *Kingdom* of BINTAN<br> Thou shalt perform, MALACCA’S Foe: her *score*<br> Of *Ills* in one day *paying*, which *That* ran<br> Into, for many a hundred year before.
With patient courage, more then of a man, <br>*Dangers*, and *Toyles*, sharp *Spikes*, *Hills* always hoare,<br> *Spears*, *Arrows*, *Trenches*, *Bulwarks*, *Fire and Sword*,<br> That thou shalt break, and quell, I pass my word.<br> (This text is from Richard Fanshawe’s 1655 translation; the work has been translated a number of times into English.)

By the 17th century, Malacca was making a more regular appearance in literature written in English. As well as its inclusion in guides of the world, guides to spices and general histories, it was again featured in poetry. David Dickson was a Scottish preacher and his *Truth’s Victory over Error*, or, *An abridgement of the chief controversies in religion which since the apostles days to this time, have been, and are in agitation, between those of the Orthodox faith, and all adversaries whatsoever*… was a translation into English of Dickson’s sermons given in Latin. It is relevant that by this stage the city of Malacca was being specified rather than the more vague “Golden Cherson”.

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“As Ophirs Gold, which from Malacca came,<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Made Solomon on Earth the richest Man.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;So will this Book make rich thy heart and mind,<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;With Divine Wisdom, Knowledge of all kind.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Thee richer make than Croesus of great name,<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Thee wiser make than Solon of great fame. <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Than all the seven wise Sages, Greeces Glory,<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I do protest it’s true, and is no Story.” 5

We also see the direct Biblical link being used. Malacca was being firmly situated in the cultural geography of Europe in texts such as this. Being already “familiar” and linked to Biblical and classical references, the city developed an identity in European culture through these depictions. This also links to the Portuguese use of religious justification for colonisation.

Under the heading “Manners of the People”, the residents were described by Pierre d’ Avity as follows:
