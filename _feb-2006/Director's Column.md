In the past 40 to 50 years, human
development has been significantly
influenced by science and technology.
From connectivity to lifestyle, the
pervasiveness of this discipline cannot
be understated. We have witnessed
new recreational pursuits, such as
digital creations impacting the movie
industry, and new digital tools that
often replaces human intervention
altogether.

Science's underlying goal is to produce
useful models of possibilities, and to
use these models to improve human
lives. These scientific methods can also
help us make reasonable predictions
to benefit society or human individuals
who make use of them. As a tool,
science allows us to contend more
effectively with our surroundings
and to better adapt and evolve as a
social whole.

While science seemingly often make
its advances slowly, business, on the
other hand, transforms and impacts
our lives daily with globalisation and
limitless possibilities of new products
and services created by both scientific
possibilities and business acumen.
Business - both multi-national
corporations (MNCs) and small and
medium enterprises (SMEs) - creates
millions of jobs and opportunities for
the global population and provide most
of us with comfortable lives. Business also encourages innovation and
creativity as entrepreneurs strive to
make a mark in the corporate world,
and business organisations compete
to stay ahead of each other. As part
of international trade, business
also fosters relationships between
countries and governments, and
promotes international cooperation.

The Science andTechnology, and
Business Collections in the Lee
Kong Chian Reference Library have
been built to meet the information
needs of researchers, businesses,
professionals and library users.
With the 24,000-strong Science and
Technology Collection and 26,000-
strong Business Collection, library
users have a wealth of information
to draw upon. These collections are
by no means exhaustive, and we are
constantly expanding our resources
to cater to the growing demand in
these two fields. You can find out more about these collections in
the write-ups found in this issue
of BiblioAsia, on pages 6 and 8.

Besides having quality collections,
the National Library also provides
reference and enquiry services to
library users looking for guidance
and assistance in getting the
appropriate information. Very
recently, we received a science
reference enquiry on the refining
of palm oil into edible cooking oil.
Another interesting enquiry is from
a user who required information on
e-retailing in music industry and the
key indicators worldwide. Following
a quick clarification by the way of
a reference interview, librarians
will search the National library's
catalogue, subscribed
databases and Internet for materials
that cover the topics or are associated
with the subject matter so as to
provide the enquirers with the
required information. We will also
consult with our local and overseas
colleagues and experts connected to
NLB, where appropriate.

In the months of February and
March, science and business take
centre stage in the National Library.
In February, we are extremely
privileged to collaborate with the
Imperial College Alumni Association
to launch a mini-series entitled
Body Parts: The Science of Human
Reconstruction. The series begins
on 4 February 2006, comprising
workshops, public debates and
lectures on cloning, prosthesis
and building a synthetic man from
scratch. In March, we will invite
the China Enterprises Association
and Singapore Indian Chamber of
Commerce and Industry to conduct
talks on business ventures in China
and India. In addition, there are
sharing sessions and workshops on
how to enhance your business. We
hope that these programmes will be
of interest to you and we encourage
you to sign up for them via the NLB
website, <a href="https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/home">https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/home</a>.

We look forward to seeing you at
the Library!
