#### Clyde Elliott was the first Hollywood director to shoot a feature film in Singapore. **Chua Ai Lin** examines the authenticity of the three movies he produced here in the 1930s.

Singapore entered Hollywood’s popular imagination at the turn of the 20th century when motion pictures began showing scenes of a modern and exotic Asian port city with a heady mix of the East and the West.

In January 1936, an article in *The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser* suggested that with so many American filmmakers arriving on its shores, Singapore was fast “becoming the equatorial Hollywood”.[^1] Just two months later, an editorial in the same newspaper entitled “The Film Invasion” described the large influx “of film people from Hollywood”, including “such famous names as Frank Buck, Ward Wing, Tay Garnett, James A. Fitzpatrick, and Percy Marmont, to say nothing of Charlie Chaplin”.[^2]

The earliest footages of Singapore would have been newsreels, documentaries and travelogues. Twenty-four such films from 1900 to 1919 and nine from 1920 to 1928 have been identified, most notably works by the leading international newsreel production company, Pathé, as well as four short films by Gaston Méliès (brother of the famous French filmmaker George Méliès) in 1913, which were screened in American cinemas that year.[^3]

From 1928 onwards, longer feature films of Singapore were produced. Some of these depicted Singapore as an obscure locale in the exotic East with no actual footage of the island, while others tried to inject varying degrees of realism with artificial studio settings and stock footage of scenes of Malayan life.

These films included *Across to Singapore* (1928), *Sal of Singapore* (1928), *The Crimson City* (1928; also known by its Italian title, *La schiava di Singapore*), *The Letter* (1928), *The Road to Singapore* (1931), *Rich and Strange* (1931), *Out of Singapore* (1932), *Malay Nights* (1932; also titled as *Shadows of Singapore*), *Singapore Sue* (1932) and *West of Singapore* (1933).[^4] Interestingly, none of these films were ever shot in Singapore.
