#### **Introduction**

With 26 public pools across the city, complemented by pools of private clubs and residences, Singapore residents today have no shortage of access to water for recreation and sport. This wider access to swimming is often traced back to the opening of Mount Emily Pool in 1931, placing Singapore’s history of leisure swimming as a phenomenon of the 20th century.2 The first municipally owned site for swimming, Mount Emily Pool arguably represents the point when swimming became truly public. It was part of a
wider programme of the Municipal Commissioners, who were beginning to
see public recreation as part of their remit, thus representing an important
transition from older laissez-faire models to a modern one of government
provision.3 However, the attention given to Mount Emily Pool, which
highlights public swimming, also masks a longer history of popular
swimming in Singapore that extends to the early 19th century.

Although swimming environments prior to Mount Emily Pool were
not public in the current sense, there have nonetheless been places for
popular swimming in Singapore since at least the 1820s, more than 100
years before the opening of Mount Emily Pool. My aim here is to extend
the accepted timeframe of public swimming by sketching an initial history
of the wider social and physical environments of swimming in colonial
Singapore. It begins with the origins of British colonialism and ends with
the Japanese Occupation.

Several histories have addressed swimming in Singapore, but none cover
this extended period. Ying-Kit Chan wrote a significant study of swimming
in relation to Singapore’s politics, though focused on a postcolonial setting.4
Jocelyn Lau and Lucien Low recorded the popular memory of a large
collection of pools, and other detailed histories have been written about
individual swimming clubs.5 Most often, references to the local history
of swimming are minor parts of wider sports histories, including those of
writers such as Nick Aplin and Peter Horton, who reasonably focus more on
the development of athletic sporting pursuits.6

My intention, however, is to document a wider view of swimming, not
just as sport or exercise, but as a series of interconnected social practices
based around designated swimming sites. To piece together this history, I
worked with various primary sources at the National Library and National
Archives of Singapore, combining passing details from newspapers, maps,
reports, photographs, travel memoirs and other materials, to build an initial
picture of the development of popular swimming practices and locations
across the 19th and early 20th centuries. These record the environments of
early swimming, and the debates surrounding them.

Based on the period of British colonialism in Singapore, this history is
very much about how British administrative views shaped local ideas on
swimming and bathing. It is about how a new geography of bathing was
established within the colony through definitions and limitations of water
use. As such, I do not discuss the bathing practices that originated from
Singapore’s precolonial settlements. The chosen time period traverses the
introduction of Singapore’s public water system, addresses how Victorian
morality met colonial racism, and considers how bathing transformed from
personal respite to communal leisure, and then to sporting exercise.

#### **19th-Century Swimming**

Various types of aquatic leisure environments have been available and
popular in Singapore since the early period of British settlement. These have
included *pagar* (fenced sea enclosures), bathing piers and swimming tanks,
which are the predecessors of today’s Olympic-standard pools. However, it
is not always straightforward to bring these examples together and suggest
them as sources of contemporary swimming approaches.

The problem in extending histories of swimming to the 19th century lies
in historical language, and the common practices and understandings then.
What we today recognise as “swimming” – an athletic activity with fixed
strokes and distances – did not exist for most of the 19th century. As Nick
Aplin indicates, 19th-century swimming was more a social activity, which
although allowing for community games, was not really a sport yet.7 The
term “swimming” in its present sense was not even applicable then. Based on its use in 19th-century newspapers, people in Singapore only “swam”
when fleeing sinking ships or escaping pirates.8 The word was not applied to
a leisurely dip in the water, instead suggesting emergency crossings of water,
which were certainly not perceived as recreational. Leisurely forms of going
into the water were understood as “bathing”.

The use of the word “bathing” does raise complications, particularly
for its association with hygienic forms of washing, which are very distinct
from what we now consider “swimming”. However, these two approaches to
entering the water share common historical roots that combine leisure and
cleansing, and are described in several histories of bathing, including the
classic work of architecture historian Sigfried Giedion.9 In the 19th century,
swimming and washing were still largely unified activities; people bathed
for many reasons: exercise, recreation, socialising, hygiene and sometimes
even games or competition. Water-based competitions were launched at the
New Year Sports Day and events such as the opening of the New Harbour
(Keppel Bay), and public lectures and the popular press gave advice about
the general health benefits of sea swimming, as well as warnings of the
dangers of bathing as exercise.10

This distinction of historical language is useful, as it helps to map a
series of interconnected activities that sets the scope of this initial history.
Based on this language, my approach has been to incorporate the period’s
wider sense of “bathing”. Therefore, I combine recreational swimming,
public washing, socialising in the water, and the gradual emergence of
water-based athletics, considering the design of the physical locations that
allowed these varied activities to take place. My intention is to make sense
of how water access was mapped onto Singapore’s landscape within the
British colonial system. Essentially, this is to consider how people could
access water, what kinds of structures provided this access, and how water
bodies were classified for public use. Official efforts to define public bathing
resulted in special designations of urban water bodies, mapping the town’s water according to allowable practices within the colonial system. It was
through these designations that modern ideas of water use emerged, leading
to new definitions of swimming and its separation from washing and
domestic bathing.

#### **An Imported Bathing Culture**

The British arriving in Singapore from 1819 brought with them their own
ideas about public bathing. It was only since the beginning of the 19th
century that sea swimming became popular, as British culture turned away
from older inland springs and spas and found the pleasures of the seashore.11
As Ian Bradley demonstrates, European spas had developed as sites for
healing, where people might take part in practices of balneotherapy and
hydrotherapy,12 and later became spaces for leisure and indulgence.13 As
bathing in the sea grew in prominence in British culture, it also adopted
these mixed uses, being seen at times as a place for health, but also as a place
for recreation and pleasure. Over time, the same mixed purposes transferred
onto the pool, the tank and the tub.

European sailors arriving in Singapore encountered a tropical and at
times oppressive heat, as well as year-round warm waters, and they were
clearly interested in bathing in the sea. From the 1820s, they often dove into
the harbour waters beside their ships both to clean themselves and to enjoy
the water, in a practice known as “bathing ship-side”. The early press advised
against this activity given the potential dangers of drowning or being
taken by a shark, and some did die while bathing ship-side.14 The warnings
reduced the practice for a time, but it would return and the warnings
resumed. From the recurring press warnings, it seems that bathing ship-side
in open water continued throughout the 19th century.15

But it was not only transient sailors who wanted to swim; European
residents of the town also wanted to enjoy the seaside and began planning
their own recreational space. Early in 1827, a group gathered to fund a
beachside bathing enclosure. In May that year, the *Singapore Chronicle*
reported on the newly finished *pagar* at the Esplanade, below what was
then the town’s second battery, next to the mouth of the Bras Basah
River.16 This was colonial Singapore’s first swimming structure, and its first
designated recreational space, arriving two years before the formation of the
Billiards Club in 1829, which Walter Makepeace regarded as the town’s first
sporting club.17

As described in the *Singapore Chronicle*, the battery *pagar* directly
fronted the Esplanade beach. Along the shore, it comprised three walls of
nibong palm poles enclosing a swimming area of 65 m by 65 m.18 Above
the farthest wall from the shore were dressing rooms, suggesting a pier
along one side allowing swimmers to access them. This approach of placing
dressing rooms over the water followed contemporary European practices
and resembled early “bathing machines” – portable cabins that could be
wheeled into the water.19 This approach was defined by contemporary
European concepts of morality and decency, where bathing clothes were
viewed as a state of undress, and therefore no one wanted to be seen publicly
in such an immodest state. Dressing rooms directly over the water allowed
the least amount of time that a person could accidentally be seen improperly
dressed. The location of this *pagar* would later be called Scandal Point,
and while that name emerged for different reasons, we might imagine the
original “scandal” of this place as the undressed bodies of bathers.

The author of the original description of the battery *pagar* considered
its architectural style to be “somewhat rude”, and thought the dressing
rooms too high above the water.20 However, they otherwise considered
the structure perfectly adequate, hoping its establishment would provide a
place for public bathing for years to come. The “rudeness” of the enclosure
most likely refers to its regional vernacular construction. The battery *pagar* appears to have used conventions of Malay and Orang Laut architecture,
which remained the dominant architectural style for Singapore’s *pagar*
over the following century. A very similar construction style was still used
for enclosures of the 1920s and 1930s, shown in images of military bathing
enclosures (Figure 1), and described by Bob Pattimore in recollections of the
*pagar* at the tin smelting works on Pulau Brani.21 The key elements were a
fence for protection, a place to dress, and a pier to access the water.

The original *pagar* at the Esplanade did not last long. Only one further
reference to it was made in the press, at the start of 1828, when a convict
was accidentally killed by a police officer while bathing there.22 There is
no record of how or why the battery *pagar* was removed, though it is quite
possible that it collapsed in a monsoon, as happened with similar structures
later in the century.23 Though it was short-lived and quickly forgotten – later discussion of early bathing made no mention of it – the structure of the
*pagar*, as a typology of leisure architecture, remained much the same for
more than a century.24

#### **A Series of Short-lived Establishments and Failed Plans**

After the battery *pagar*, there were no immediate attempts to build new
facilities for bathing. It was reported in 1846 that a committee was formed
to build a new bathing *pagar* at the Esplanade, but it was not realised.25 A
new enclosure was finally built in 1849, called Marine Villa, at the end of
Telok Ayer Road.26 Throughout the 19th century, bathing places (as with
any other recreational activity) were expected to be products of private
interest, formed as social clubs or as businesses. Marine Villa was a business,
charging ten cents for entry; it opened two days a week for families, and
one day for single men. Marine Villa probably did not last long – it was last
mentioned in the press in 1850.27

In the mid-1860s, there were two further attempts to establish formal
bathing sites. One was another business venture at Orchard Road, catering
to nearby residents. For this, W. R. Scott had a freshwater pool, “a large
swimming bath built of brick and stone, surrounded with a high brick wall”,
built on his Abbotsford estate, which he opened to the European public in
1866.28 However, according to C. B. Buckley, it was not used very much
and only lasted a year.29 Around the same time, Singapore’s first swimming
club was founded in Tanjong Rhu. After an initial meeting, Charles Crane
was assigned to organise the place, overseeing the construction of a new
pagar on the east coast. According to Buckley, the enclosure was built on a
sandbank away from the shore.30 The club continued for a couple of years,
but dissolved when the *pagar* was destroyed in a monsoon. In the 1870s and 1880s, a series of indoor bathhouses were opened. In the town, Gazzolo
&amp; Co. was on North Bridge Road, and the Waterfall Club opened at the
foot of Pearl’s Hill.31 For those who could spend a couple of days in the
countryside, there was the Tivoli Bathhouse in Bukit Timah.32

None of these sites were longstanding establishments, but the
intermittent appearance of bathing places does show growing interest in
public bathing. The number of bathing places grew after 1867, when the
Straits Settlements became a colony separate from India. As Mary Turnbull
described, this was a period of economic growth when European settlers
began demanding something more from their place of residence – wanting
to develop the town, making it physically more impressive, and providing
greater recreational spaces.33 The problem faced by early bathing sites
– the reason they closed so quickly – seems mostly to have been financial.
Bathing architecture required significant upfront costs for construction,
and the resulting attendance was just not enough to support the costs of
maintenance.

The lack of bathers to financially support bathing sites was not a sign
of limited interest in the water, but rather a product of the social structures
of bathing within British colonies. Generally, the mixing of races and
sexes in bathing sites was not allowed – the majority of the formal bathing
sites mentioned above were made for European men, which comprised a
minuscule part of Singapore’s overall population. Furthermore, the places
also had to compete for the men’s time with a range of other sporting
and social clubs, which as John Butcher has shown, formed the primary
setting for European social lives in the British colonies of Southeast Asia.34
Marine Villa did offer family days, which meant that European women and
children could also swim, and the Waterfall Club was one of the few sites
that provided for both European and Asian bathers, with separate rooms and bathing tanks.35 Racial segregation in bathing continued into the 1960s,
though in more popularly accessible places like the Young Men’s Christian
Association (YMCA) Pool it had disappeared by the 1920s. Separated
bathing based on sex continued well into the 20th century, and the Mount
Emily Pool ran a schedule offering different times for men and women
bathers up until the beginning of the Japanese Occupation (at which point,
the Japanese authorities that reopened the pool in 1942 maintained a similar
schedule).36

As people tried to establish swimming clubs and bathhouse businesses,
particularly from the 1870s onwards, newspaper letter writers complained
about the lack of recreational bathing options. Some insisted (contrary
to the historical evidence) there had never been an established place for
bathing in Singapore, and that if towns like Penang, Shanghai and Hong
Kong had their own baths, then surely Singapore must as well.37 They also
insisted that bathing would surely make a good business, calling on some
enterprising resident to step forward. One writer, perhaps seeing little other
option, even had the audacity to volunteer Cheang Hong Lim to extend his
philanthropy and build a public bath.38

These exaggerated remarks help prepare an image of the kinds of
recreational bathing environments people wanted. These letter writers in
the late 19th century were usually driven by concerns of safety and decency,
much like the group who made the battery *pagar* in 1827. They wanted
fenced enclosures to protect themselves from sharks, and changing rooms
or a fenced screen to protect their modesty. Over time, they began asking
for additional conveniences, like placing the *pagar* farther out to sea so
tidal patterns would not dictate bathing times.39 They preferred an easily
accessible central location, often proposing the beach at the Esplanade as the most ideal site.40 These suggestions centred around similar ideas for public
bathing, shaping wider discussion and informing the more substantial
proposals for swimming that emerged later in the century.

What followed were defined proposals for ambitious popular bathing
structures, which went unbuilt. In 1889, the Rowing Club developed
plans for a large pool on the Raffles Reclamation ground, in front of the
Raffles School.41 The plan fell apart because of its grand scale: it required
excavation, construction of a concrete pool, and the creation of a sluice
system that would allow the pool to be filled with seawater and drained
for cleaning. Combined with their proposal for a clubhouse, the scheme
just became too expensive for the club to pursue. As the Rowing Club gave
up on its plans for swimming, in 1891 a private individual, W. A. Wafford,
went to the Straits Legislative Assembly with two proposals for bathing
sites: a floating bath moored off Johnston’s Pier, or a piled enclosure built
off the Esplanade.42 The Assembly rejected both, because the former would
interrupt boats, and the Assembly would not privatise the Esplanade – the
most prominent public place in the town – or risk spoiling its views.
