#### Visiting Senior Research Fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies Dr _Arun Bala_ writes that recent studies have questioned the Eurocentric understanding of Singapore society and the science that drives it. These new approaches may be characterised as dialogical in contrast to traditional Eurocentric perspectives, suggesting that a confluence of different Eastern cultures, along with the Western tradition, gave birth to the Singapore and modern science that we know today.

The history of Singapore has traditionally been narrated from the perspective of its discovery by Sir Stamford Raffles in 1819 and its subsequent development from a sleepy village to a modern metropolis. The passing away of the colonialist regime and the developments that followed post-independence continued the basic narrative, showing how postcolonial Singapore built upon British colonial heritage. This narrative assumes that the major turning point in Singapore’s history occurred in the early 19th century when the forces that shaped Singapore’s future began to come into play and distinguish the new country from its antiquarian past.1

This narrative parallels the version of the history of modern science that most Singapore students imbibe at school. Students learn that modern science emerged in Europe in the 17th century and that the subsequent phenomenal advances Europeans made in this field exemplify why it came to be the Europeans — rather than any other people — who founded Singapore two centuries later, transforming it into a successful trading city. What is significant about these origin stories is that the major cultures that came to constitute the population of Singapore — Chinese, Malay-Islamic, and Indian — are not recognised as having played significant roles as formative influences on the birth of either Singapore or modern science. Instead these cultures are seen as adapting themselves to the society and science that prevail in Singapore today, which are largely the creation of the West.

However, recent studies question this Eurocentric understanding of Singapore society and the science that drives it. These studies argue that the major Asian cultures — Chinese, Malay-Islamic and Indian — that contributed to Singapore’s identity played a far greater role in shaping its society and the science and technology upon which it is founded than hitherto suspected. Moreover, the developments and interactions between Singapore and these Asian cultures took place in an era predating colonial influence. These new approaches may be characterised as dialogical in contrast to traditional Eurocentric perspectives, suggesting that a confluence of different Eastern cultures, along with the Western tradition, gave birth to the Singapore and modern science that we know today.

#### **Dialogical Histories of Singapore**

This dialogical perspective on the birth of modern Singapore has been in the making for some time. Emerging from earlier studies, it contextualised the modern trading networks created by Europeans in Asia against the historical backdrop of trading networks developed by Asian pioneers in the previous millennium. In both modern and historical times, these trading networks linked East Asia with South Asia and West Asia, via Southeast Asia.2 To date, the most sustained attempt to reread Singapore’s history and locate its birth in the pre-modern era is documented in the study *Singapore: A 700 Year History* by Kwa Chong Guan, Derek Heng and Tan Tai Yong. They argue that the history of Singapore should be contextualised within the larger cycles of maritime history in the Straits of Melaka, and that its beginnings — as narrated in the *Sejarah Melayu* (Malay Annals) — should be traced back to its founding by Seri Teri Buana in the early 14th century. For nearly a century after its founding, Singapore — then known as Temasek — served as an emporium connecting its Southeast Asian hinterland with the Middle East, India and China.

However, the importance of Temasek as an emporium for the region declined over time. Its fifth ruler had to flee from attacks by the Thai people or the Majapahit empire (or both), and resurrect the emporium in Melaka. As Melaka’s secondary appendage in the 15th century, the fortunes of Singapore declined further when Melaka fell to the Portuguese in 1511 and Singapore came under the influence of the Johor Sultanate. Finally, trade through Singapore collapsed after the Dutch captured Melaka from the Portuguese in 1641 and diverted the Indian-Pacific Ocean trade from the Straits of Melaka to their port in Batavia via the Sunda Straits between Sumatra and Java.3

Singapore’s fortunes revived only after Stamford Raffles, recognising Singapore’s early historical position as an emporium in the 14th century, once again restored it to the centre of trans-Oceanic trade, which flourished as the British Empire increasingly consolidated its hold on India (as an imperial power) and China (through its unequal treaty ports). Singapore became the hub of these trade exchanges, and the premier entrepot for the Southeast Asian region.4

There are other historians who also endorse a dialogical account of the birth of Singapore. In their study *Singapore: A Biography*, Mark Ravinder Frost and Yu-Mei BalasinghamChow write:

Like its present day successor, 14th century Singapore was<br> also cosmopolitan … shards of excavated pottery reveal<br> that the local inhabitants shared a culture in common with<br> the people of the Riau-Lingga archipelago …. But there<br> were other distinctive groups who lived on the island. One<br> prominent group, as revealed by numerous items they left <br>behind, were Chinese merchants who had traded in the<br> region since the 11th century at least, bringing with them <br>ceramics, textiles, foodstuffs, and coins …. Other pottery<br> shards indicate the presence of Javanese, themselves a <br>trading power in the region, while a coin from Sri Lanka and beads and Carnelian stones from India point to the<br> arrival of Tamils and Sinhalese …. Temasek would have<br> been much like the ports in the region during this time — a <br>vibrant emporium and a cultural melting pot.5
