Do not live in a place where there are no temples” cautions an age-old Indian aphorism. In keeping with the sagely advice of his forefathers, one of the first things that Naraina Pillai did after his arrival in Singapore in 1819 was to establish a Hindu temple for his fellow countrymen.

In 1827, four years after the land was acquired, Sri Mariamman Temple, Singapore’s oldest Hindu place of worship, finally stood proud along South Bridge Road. The nondescript wood-and-attap construction erected then was a simple affair compared to the splendidly intricate and colourful structure that attracts Hindu worshippers as well as busloads of tourists today.

Located in the heart of Chinatown, the temple’s elaborate gopuram 1  has been a landmark for generations of Hindu worshippers in Singapore.2 In deference to its architectural and historical significance, the temple was gazetted as a national monument on 28 June 1973.3

Singapore’s First Hindu Temple
The history of the Sri Mariamman Temple is closely intertwined with the arrival of the first Indians to Singapore, soon after Stamford Raffles established a British trading post on the island in February 1819.4 South Indian migrants to Singapore, feeling displaced in a new land, brought with them the cultural and religious practices of the subcontinent, including the worship of Mariamman, the goddess of rain. In Hindu spirituality, the “mother” deity is known for her power to protect people from harm and to cure epidemic illnesses and diseases.5
