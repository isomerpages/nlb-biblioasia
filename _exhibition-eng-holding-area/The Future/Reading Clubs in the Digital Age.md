#### **Introduction**
The digital age refers to our current era characterised by advanced technology, ubiquitous electronic devices, and diverse methods of accessing information. Reading clubs are gatherings where people come together to discuss books. In this context, what forms do reading clubs take, and what challenges and opportunities do they face? How can organisers harness the distinctive features of our digital age to run effective activities?

#### **(1) How the Digital Age Benefits Reading Clubs**
**1. Facilitates Recruitment and Promotion**：
Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Little Red Book, and TikTok offer reading club organisers excellent channels for promotion and outreach, making recruitment much easier.

**2. Richer Digital Tools**：Platforms like WeChat Reading, Kindle, Dedao, and Fanshu make purchasing books, reading, and note-taking incredibly convenient. For instance, WeChat Reading's group function allows users to log 30 minutes of daily reading. Upon completing a book, for example "One Hundred Years of Solitude," it automatically generates a comprehensive reading report.

**3. Greater Flexibility Through Online Meetings**：There's no need to rent venues or coordinate complex schedules—simply open Zoom or Tencent Meeting to discuss books anytime, anywhere.

**4. Improved Access to Resources** ：E-books are affordable or even free, while platforms like YouTube, Little Red Book, and Bilibili feature numerous book reviewers who provide summaries and analyses to help readers quickly grasp a book's key concepts.

#### **(2) Challenges the Digital Age Presents**
**1. Information Overload and Attention Scarcity**：People today face constant information bombardment from social media, short videos, news alerts, and other sources, severely limiting time and focus available for reading. Reading clubs must design more engaging content and formats to capture and hold members' attention.

**2. Online Sessions Lack Warmth**：While online communication offers convenience, it lacks the emotional connection of face-to-face interaction, making discussions less engaging than in-person meetings. Many readers join reading clubs drawn by interest in a particular book but find it difficult to commit to ongoing participation. Reading clubs must develop retention strategies such as reading challenges, member reward systems, and themed discussions to keep members engaged.

**3. Decline in Deep Reading**
The prevalence of short videos and bite-sized information has eroded people's ability to focus on lengthy, substantial books. As people become accustomed to bite-sized content and instant gratification, the patience required for thorough reading and meaningful discussion becomes harder to sustain. Reading clubs must actively cultivate members' capacity for deep thinking through structured reading guidance and critical thinking exercises.

#### **(3) Where Are the Opportunities for Reading Club Organisers in the Digital Age?**

**1. Hybrid Models That Lower Organisational Barriers**
Traditional reading clubs required fixed venues and complex scheduling, creating high organisational costs. Today's clubs can blend online discussions with offline gatherings—for instance, daily conversations in WeChat groups complemented by regular in-person meetings. Video conferencing tools like Zoom and Tencent Meeting enable remote participation, allowing members from different locations to join discussions.

**2. Enhanced Reading Experience Through AI and Digital Tools**
AI-powered tools like ChatGPT can generate reading summaries and organise key concepts, helping members quickly grasp essential content and making discussions more efficient. Digital organisation tools such as Notion, Mubu, and Xmind enable structured presentation of book content through mind maps and knowledge cards, leading to more focused discussions.

**3. Streamlined Community Management and Brand Building**
Individuals can establish personal brands and become influential reading opinion leaders by consistently sharing book reviews and curated reading lists. Through sustained effort, reading clubs can evolve from intimate circles into influential platforms that reach broader audiences.

**4. Innovative Experiences Through Emerging Technologies**
 Future reading clubs may incorporate VR reading environments, AI-facilitated discussions, and virtual meetups to create more immersive experiences. Possibilities include AI-generated personalised book recommendations and intelligent reading guidance systems.


#### **Conclusion**
The digital age presents reading clubs with both new opportunities and fresh challenges. While technological tools make reading and communication more convenient, they also create problems such as fragmented attention. For organisers, the key lies in harnessing the benefits of digital tools while preserving what makes reading clubs valuable – fostering deep reading and meaningful intellectual exchange. Reading clubs need not remain merely hobby groups; they can evolve into knowledge brands or even forge entirely new career opportunities.
