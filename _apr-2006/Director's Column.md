As the world progresses towards a knowledge-based economy, useful information needs to be made easily available. Globalisation, connectivity and interactivity at all levels are flattening the world and changing the rules of national competitiveness. In such an economy, the creation of and access to information is a significant economic, social and cultural activity.

In supporting Singapore’s aspiration to become a knowledge hub, the National Library strives to serve as a reference and research centre for all Singaporeans and foreigners. The “Find It” campaign, which will be launched on 11 April at the Library, seeks to bring greater visibility to and awareness of the reference services and treasure trove of knowledge found in the Library’s collections. The campaign aims to support the Library in its effort to nuture independent information seekers and to become the preferred stop for Asian content and collection services. With the series of thematic info-literacy talks, panel discussions and specific programmes that target the four sectors of design, education, heritage and business, the campaign holds exciting promises for all who seek information and knowledge for various purposes.

Besides stimulating our grey matter, one also needs nurturing for the soul. In an extraordinary photographic exhibition, the long gone era of Singapore is revisited through the works of the late master photographer Mr Yip Cheong Fun. Running till 15 May 2006 and jointly organised by the Singapore Heritage Society, the National Library Board and the family of the late Mr Yip Cheong Fun, the exhibition features more than 130 of Yip’s best photographs. Also, in conjunction with the Singapore Arts Festival, the National Library will bring the arts right to its doorsteps in June. Arts lovers will get to meet and interact with two groups of overseas artists in workshops organised jointly by National Library Board and the National Arts Council. Works by prominent local sculptors, including Ms Han Sai Por, will also be showcased at the Plaza. This issue of BiblioAisa captures the National Library’s celebration of distinguished readers, artists, painters and photographers, their works and contribution to Singapore’s society.

With nourishment for the mind and soul, we are not neglecting the body. The month of May will kick off a panel discussion on the upcoming 2006 FIFA World Cup. Made up of leading local and foreign football personalities, the discussion, together with other programmes, will study the various aspects of football and examine why this age-old sport continues to captivate us. Programmes that touch on gaming and extreme sports will also be featured in May. Look out for these events on our website at www.nlb.gov.sg. 

We look forward to seeing you at the Library and happy reading!
