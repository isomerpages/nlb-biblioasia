#### **Melissa De Silva** mulls over what it is to be Eurasian in this evocative short story that takes her back to the Portuguese Settlement in Malacca.

I am nine.

I am in Primary Three, in social studies class at the all-girls Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus. Not all of us are Catholic (we even have some Muslims in the enrolment) and unlike my mother’s day when sweet Irish nuns taught classes, none of our teachers are nuns except one who makes me think of a bespectacled cockroach. That day, the social studies lesson promises pleasant disruption because we have to move out of the classroom to the air-conditioned video lab. We also get to choose our seats, and I choose to sit with my three friends (we’re the only ones in class who study Malay as a second language): Faranaz Alam, Michelle Joseph and Geraldine Minjoot.

When the chatter and movement across the room finally settles, Ms Pat Lim, a short, chunky woman with a porky sort of face, casts her eye over us.

“Those four Indian girls sitting together, split up!”

My three friends and I look at one another. Who was she talking to? Faranaz is of Pakistani descent; Geraldine is Eurasian, like me. Only Michelle is Indian.

“I said move!” she snaps.

She clearly means us. We are alarmed. Being nine, and cowed by the authority of a teacher, we break apart and manage to find random seats among the rest of the pupils. I’m not able to articulate the sense of unfairness I feel, like a hot, clenched fist. But during the rest of the lesson, and as I sit brooding on the public bus that afternoon, I can’t shake my conviction – what she’d done was wrong. Why shouldn’t we have been allowed to sit together? Never mind that she was ignorant only one of us was Indian. Every single one of the rest of our class was Chinese – all thirty of them – and they were sitting all together, weren’t they?

I am twenty-five.

I am trying to communicate with the immigration official at the airport in Barcelona. He is speaking in Spanish, and I respond in my newly acquired broken Italian, refusing to lapse into English, because I’m ridiculously determined not to stick out as even more of a tourist. He is stony-faced when he accepts my red Singaporean passport. Then he flips it open and his eyes glide over my surname. His expression lifts.

“De Silva,” he enunciates perfectly.

“You are Portuguese?”

“II mio nonno.” My grandfather. Now, that’s not exactly true. But I don’t know how to say “great-grandfather” in Italian so I can’t tell him it was my great-grandfather who was from Goa and he was only part Portuguese. But none of this seems to matter.

“Muy bueno!” He beams genuine welcome at me and I experience a strange warm feeling I’ve never felt at Changi Airport returning home.

I am thirty-five.

I am in a cab on the way to the Eurasian Association at Ceylon Road. The taxi driver eyes me openly in the rear view mirror.

“Miss, you are what ah?“

I’ve moved beyond my teenage belligerence, when I would either not acknowledge they were referring to my race or retort, “Human.” I don’t even roll my eyes anymore, even in my head. I think I’ve come a long way.

“Eurasian.”

“What is loo-rayshiun?”

“People who are mixed. Europe people and Asia people mixed together.”

“Aww… like Gurmit Singh issit?” he says, referring to the Singaporean comedian.

“Er… no. Uncle, Gurmit Singh is Chinese and Indian. His surname is ‘Singh’, so – never mind.”

I’ve never understood why it seems so difficult to understand. No doubt we make up less than one percent of the population, but we’ve been part of this country since the colonial times, as long as some and longer than others.

We spend the rest of the journey in silence, zooming past skeletons of condos rising from stamp-sized plots of land, regurgitated tarmac and clay from road works and the boarded-up Red House Bakery on East Coast Road, its shophouse face shuttered and mute. This is Singapore. Where you’d be a fool to cling to any place held dear, where the treasures of space and memory being blasted into oblivion is the only certainty in the ferocious race for development. The red-brick National Library where my mother used to take me since I was two, demolished to make way for a yawning traffic tunnel. Block 28 Lorong 6 in the Toa Payoh neighbourhood, where I lived with my grandparents till I was five, razed to the ground. Thank god the dragon playground in front of the building was spared, out of a government nod at “preservation” and “Singapore icons”.

Some minutes later we approach the gates of our destination.

“Okay uncle, you can stop here please.”

As the taxi rolls to a halt, the driver cranes his neck to look at the massive three-storey building in the middle of the leafy residential neighbourhood. “What is this place? Your house ah?“

“No, this is the Eurasian Association.”

“Har?“

“For Eurasian people, mixed people, mix European and Asian.”

Still not rolling my eyes.

“Oh, united nations ah?“
