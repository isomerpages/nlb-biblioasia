The Saudi Arabia Cultural Mission in Singapore was open in 2008 under the umbrella of the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia in Singapore to strengthen the friendly relations between Saudi Arabia and Singapore. Since its establishment, the Cultural Mission has organised more than 10 cultural visits between the two countries and supported numerous cultural and educational events by Singapore. The Cultural Mission has also facilitated joint scientific research between the universities of both countries.

Building on these warm ties and mutual exchanges, the Saudi Arabia Cultural Mission (SACM) and the National Library Board (NLB) of Singapore signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in September 2012 to provide a framework for closer collaboration. This tie-up will see a collection of 200 publications donated to NLB by SACM. To mark the start of this partnership, a series of programmes for the public is organised to showcase the arts and culture of Saudi Arabia. The activities run from September 2012 to August 2013, and are jointly curated by the Saudi Arabia Cultural Office and NLB. This synergy serves to promote greater sharing of resources, expertise and networks for content creation on Saudi Arabia. The proposed line-up of events is planned around significant occasions such as, Saudi Arabia Day, Saudi Arabia’s Student Day, the International Summit of the Book and the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) World Library and Information Congress (WLIC).
