<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Going back to the year 2000, we made one other change. The original key
of “Majulah Singapura” is G major. And in that key the highest note is
E above C, which is one octave above C, E5 if I’m right.</p>
<p>It’s not easy to sing for many people. In fact, I didn’t always hit that
note all the time. Now it wasn’t as bad as “The Star-Spangled Banner”,
which is notoriously difficult to sing, you know, but it’s such a magnificent
tune, so they retained it. So I thought, hey, this is our chance to make
the anthem singable.</p>
<p>So I propose to lower it from G major to F major. One whole tone down.
This would make the highest note instead of E down to D, which is much
more singable than the E. And so that’s why today the key of the anthem
is F major.</p>

<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>You’re listening to <em>BiblioAsia+</em>, a podcast produced by the National
Library of Singapore. At <em>BiblioAsia</em>, we tell stories about Singapore’s
past. Some familiar, others forgotten, all fascinating.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>It will come as a surprise to many, but Singapore’s national anthem as
sung every day by thousands of schoolchildren every day is not the original
version of the song. The original version is actually longer than what
we’re now familiar with. In addition, it was also sung in a different key
from how it is sung today. In fact, “Majulah Singapura” wasn’t even meant
to be Singapore’s national anthem.</p>
<p>It was actually written to mark the reopening of the Victoria Theatre
in the late 1950s. This is not as unusual as it appears. Quite a few national
anthems began life as something else. The American national anthem, “The
Star-Spangled Banner”, was a poem set to the tune of a popular British
song. The tune for “God Save the King” comes from medieval plainchant.</p>
<p>Closer to home, the melody for Malaysia’s national anthem, “Negaraku”,
has its origins in a popular 19<sup>th</sup>-century French song, “La Rosalie”.
Here to tell us all about the history of “Majulah Singapura” and about
national anthems in general is Emeritus Professor Bernard Tan, a man who
has done a tremendous job excavating the archives to unearth the original
score for “Majulah Singapura”. He helped change the key for the song, and
who told Lee Kuan Yew a minor fib about the song when asked. Prof Tan is
a retired professor of physics, a well-known composer, and is also the
man who helped found the Singapore Symphony Orchestra. For reasons that
shall become clear later on, we’re recording this podcast in Prof Tan’s
living room.</p>
<p>Thank you for inviting us into your lovely home and hosting us today,
Prof. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Thank you, Jimmy. Welcome to my humble abode. I’m honoured to be doing
this podcast about “Majulah Singapura”, something which has sort of occupied
my attention for a lot of years, dating back to 1958, when I was a Form
4 schoolboy, you know.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>It’s, I have to say, when I first read your piece and unfortunately you
didn’t write it for <em>BiblioAsia</em>, but you wrote it for a different
publication about the history of “Majulah Singapura”. I was immediately
taken by it because there’s such an amazing story behind it, right? And
I think that a lot of people don’t actually know that.</p>
<p>As a schoolboy growing up, you think this is just a song that we sing,
but it was actually not meant to be a national anthem to begin with, it
wasn’t even a state anthem. Right. You want to tell us a little bit about
that? The history of how it came about?</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Well, I can remember the old Victoria Theatre. As it was before that renovation,
which was a much smaller theatre, 500 seats. Well, in the late 1950s, by
1957–58, the city council, there was a city council long ago who were in
charge of the Victoria Theatre, decided to do a major renovation. So the
major renovation of the property gutted out the old theatre and made a
bigger theatre seating, more than 900 seats.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>That’s quite a big jump then.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>You know, it’s quite a big jump. Ironically, the more recent renovation
a number of years ago brought the numbers down back to closer to the original.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh, that’s so interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>It becomes more intimate theatre, actually. Well anyway, <a href="https://biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg/podcast/life-and-legacy-zubir-said-julian-wong/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Zubir Said</a> by
that time had become quite a well-known composer. So the city council wanted
to have a song for the reopening of the theatre in late 1958. The motto
of the city council then was “Majulah Singapura”, which is still our motto.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh, I didn’t know that was the motto for the city council.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>In fact, somewhere around you can find the arms of the city council with
this motto there. So, they thought of having a special song based on this
motto. Someone thought of Zubir Said, and they wrote to him. He replied
immediately. And, I think trying to reconstruct the events, he actually
wrote in frivolous speed because he replied to them with a score less than
two weeks after he was asked.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay, that’s amazing.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Now this score, which still exists, at least in copy form, shows that
it is a verse plus a chorus, a verse of 16 bars, a chorus of eight bars,
repeated, repeated. So it’s 16. 16. Quite good symmetry. We have a copy
of that score because in the City Council archives, the then superintendent
of the authority was Mr Yap.</p>
<p>He wrote to all the participants in the concert saying you’ve got to learn
this new song. So send his score along with you know, many people had not
even looked at this score. But later on when I looked at the score, I suspected
it might have been in Zubir Said’s handwriting, and later on I was able
to show fairly conclusively that it was Zubir Said’s handwriting.</p>
<p>So, it was the original score. Anyway, what happened was that the concert
took place, I think it was November 1958 or something like that. And then
Singapore got self-government in 1959. Okay. So the government, the PAP
[People’s Action Party] government is looking not just for a national anthem,
but for the national symbols, the pledge, the crest and the national anthem.
And <a href="https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=8a68761c-5b59-4758-a2ce-0793a8cddfb1" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Dr Toh Chin Chye</a>,
who happened to be my boss at NUS [National University of Singapore] long
ago.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>He was a chancellor at the time, right?</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>He was. No, he was the Deputy Prime Minister at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh, okay. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>He was tasked with the job of looking at creating all these national symbols.
But someone told him that you know, the city council has already got a
song which may be suitable. And so he called up Zubir Said, listened to
the song and said, yeah, it’s okay. But he must have thought at the time
that the song was a bit too long.</p>
<p>My suspicion was that he thought that for non-Malay speakers to memorise
such a long Malay verse would have been difficult. So he told Zubir Said,
can you please shorten the song before we make it into the national anthem.
Zubir Said said, done. Now, here comes the strange part of the story. A
few months after that, Zubir Said probably was still working on the shortening,
and what actually happened was that someone told him that, “Hey Zubir,
do you know that tomorrow or day after tomorrow, the Legislative Assembly
– there was no Parliament – is going to pass a bill making your song ‘Majulah
Singapura’ the national anthem?” or this was a state anthem at the time.
So he got a copy of it and saw it indeed had been shortened but done by
somebody else and done in a way which he didn’t approve of because musically,
it was a bit clumsy.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Right. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>So he wrote a really angry letter to S. Rajaratnam, and we know this is
true because Zubir’s daughter Rohana retells all of this with the words
of the letter in <a href="https://catalogue.nlb.gov.sg/search/card?recordId=14540511" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">a book on her father</a>.
So thankfully, what happened was the bill was withdrawn.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh, you mean the bill was withdrawn?</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Yeah, the bill was withdrawn. Well, as far as I know, the bill was withdrawn.
And a couple of months later, we know that the actual bill was passed with
Zubir Said’s approved shortening. And that is an interesting history you
know, the unapproved shortening. Now, I was sort of a secondary school
boy at the time, but the government had decided to issue little, little
cards with the national anthem to the school kids and to the public.</p>
<p>And you know something? I don’t know whether this is a fake memory, but
I can remember looking at a version of the song, which is not today’s National
Anthem. In other words, unapproved.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh, if they distribute. You think you seem to.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>I think I’ve seen it, but I have searched high and low on my house. And
I found copies of the card with the approved version. Right. I’m trying
to find out whether someone has got it because I think it exists. So anyway,
once it was approved and all that official recordings were made, Zubir
Said wrote in his own handwriting a handwritten copy of the official version
of the shortening with piano accompaniment and all of that sort of thing.
And that was the one issued as a card to all the school kids in the public
later.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>I wonder if you could, you know, play us these three different versions.
And, you know, maybe annotate it.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Annotate it over. Okay. I will try to do that. Now, the original version.
And I’m just going to play the 16-bar verse because the chorus is the same
for all of them. Okay. So here in my bad piano playing is the original
version.</p>
<p>[Music playing]</p>
<p>Okay. Those are the 16 bars.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh, that’s very interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>The method of shortening this was to cut out eight bars. Eight bars would
still have been symmetrical with the chorus and eight-bar phrases [are]
musically standard. Okay. Now the version which was shortened without Zubir
Said’s approval took out eight bars, but took out eight bars in a different
way from what he was going to do later.</p>
<p>Here is the unapproved version as I remember it.</p>
<p>[Music playing]</p>
<p>Now, you listen carefully to that. You know that it’s not the current.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>It’s not current. And I’m not a musician by any stretch of imagination.
So what would be the problem?</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Okay, fair enough. Which eight bars are to be removed. Now the removal
of the eight bars in the middle of it goes like this.</p>
<p>[Music playing]</p>
<p>Then transits to this.</p>
<p>[Music playing]</p>
<p>Now, musically it is not incorrect. But in the balance of a phrase, it’s
almost like someone wrote a paragraph and cut out the key parts of the
paragraph and at the ending of the paragraph goes a certain way, and you
don’t know why it goes that way.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>There’s no logic.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>There’s no logic to it. Something is missing. Zubir’s version which we
all know took out eight bars. But of course, I can play this even though
you’d know this very well. It sounds so much more natural.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Yeah. It does. I mean, I don’t know if it’s because of the version I always
hear.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>You wouldn’t guess it had been shortened, actually. Right?</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Exactly. It doesn’t sound like it’s been shortened.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>So Zubir was of course unhappy with this. And you know to this day, the
mystery remains as to why after Toh Chin Chye had asked him to shorten
it officially from the Deputy Prime Minister. How come someone else had
asked somebody to do the shortening, and without reference to Zubir, was
going to have it passed in a bill and the legislation. It doesn’t make
sense.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>It’s crazy.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>And this is a mystery which I’m going to leave for some future historian
to dig up in the archives.</p>
<p>Someone did it who had enough musical knowledge to do the shortening but
didn’t have enough musical sensitivity to do the shortening in a musically
logical and flowing way. That’s all I’m going to say. So it really is a
mystery to this day. I leave it for some future historian to work it out.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Well, I’m glad that Zubir Said was able to learn about it and intervene
in time. I mean, he would be very upset.</p>
<p>Okay. So actually speaking of historians you know, part of what you had
to do was actually to be a historian yourself in writing the original piece
about “Majulah Singapura”. What were some of the challenges that, you know,
you said that it was something that was on your mind for quite a while?</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>The challenge was really to take my own memories of what had happened,
because I knew that there had been an unofficial shortening, and I must
have heard it because I was able to recreate the original unapproved shortening,
even though I have not found any manuscript of it, you know. But at least
Rohana’s book proves to me that there was an unofficial shortening.</p>
<p>So my task was to find out, get the sequence of events, but Rohana’s book
tells the most important part that her father had been alerted. So I went
back, and I was interested to learn about how the piece commission was
in the first place. And then I got archives to lend me the volume of the
correspondence and found, I think it was already known that it was for
that specific reopening of the Victoria Theatre.</p>
<p>But knowing how he had been in their correspondence was interesting, actually.
And the most interesting part was that the handwritten manuscript that
Mr Yap of the Victoria Theater sent to all the participants, asking them
to learn the song, had been completely overlooked.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>What do you mean, completely overlooked?</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>We know that this was a handwritten copy of the “Majulah Singapura”, but
no one had ever asked.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh, sorry, the original version, right?</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>The original version. The longer version. But no one ever asked where
did this come from? Is it from Zubir Said? And that’s when I decided to
look at his score and found this peculiarity of his handwriting. [In] the
lowercase p, the vertical is extended beyond the curved part.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>And then I had another stroke of luck because later on I came across Rahim
Jalil, the brother of the author.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Right. Iskandar Jalil.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Iskandar Jalil. Now, Rahim Jalil. What actually happened was that Zubir
had, for most of his life, lived in an apartment in Joo Chiat. Okay. Rahim
bought the apartment and of course, became a friend of Zubir. He must have
bought it directly from Zubir. And when Zubir actually shortened the national
anthem and wrote the official version with piano parts and all that, he
gave a copy of the manuscript to him.</p>
<p>And I was privileged to look at it. And because there’s a cover page with
Zubir‘s signature and then looking at that manuscript, you see that in
the words of the anthem, the same lowercase p with the vertical sticking
out. Then I decided this must be interesting, because it’s the same lowercase
p as in what Mr Yap sent to all the people.</p>
<p>I thought it was worth investigating. And of course I am not a handwriting
expert. It’s a very specialised field. But I went straight to the handwriting
expert in HSA Health Sciences Authority. He does all of the analysis for
the government.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh, for courts presumably.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Yeah. So I went to him and I said, look, here are two examples. I’m sorry,
I cannot give any further examples because it’s Zubir Said’s handwriting,
maybe I did give one or two, but these are the two key ones. So after pondering
and looking, he said, “I think I can say with reasonable probability that
it is written by the same person.” I said, “Can you say you’re sure?” He
said, “You only gave me these two or three samples.”</p>
<p>So I thought about it. Hey, he’s the expert, if he said it is reasonably
probable that the two people [are the same], it’s good enough for me.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>So, I went back to the archives and said hey, you all don’t know this,
but this thing which in fact in your website you also use this, you also
use this, but you have never said it is Zubir Said’s handwriting. But now
I can tell you Zubir Said’s handwriting. And secondly, it’s very likely
what Zubir sent to the city council after less than two weeks of writing
the song.</p>
<p>So this is the original manuscript. Okay. And archives said okay, okay,
we believe you. I said this is just a copy you know, where’s the original,
you know, with Zubir Said’s ink and all that.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Right.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Unfortunately, they told me that we have been through a long period of
renovation, you remember? And we start all our stuff in seven or eight
different places. That is going to take a long, long while to unearth it.
I don’t know, maybe they found it, but they haven’t come back to me.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Alas. Thank you actually for doing all that work. And actually uncovering,
as it were, a copy of the original score.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>There was a bonus in that sense.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>And it’s so wonderful to be able to see his actual handwriting. So in
the original score that he had written, there wasn’t a fanfare introduction.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>No, it was just the melody starting from the part with words.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>That’s right. But he also wrote that fanfare introduction.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Yes, of course he did that. Now, when was the fanfare introduction introduced?
The problem is actually I suspect that he might have added it on for the
concert in 1952. Because we do have a copy of the programme. There was
an orchestra and a chorus and a choir.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay. So that makes sense, if you have a full orchestra.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>An orchestra and choir were conducted by someone I know, the late <a href="https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=492eda72-11e0-400e-962f-368e14694bea" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Paul Abisheganaden</a>.
Very well-known musician. And certainly, Paul was the one who did the orchestration
and the region for the choir. At that point of time, I think it’s very
possible, very likely, that he had tacked on the fanfare introduction.</p>
<p>But we can only be sure from a <a href="https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/audiovisual_records/record-details/6cf3e3b1-1164-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">recording</a> made
on the 12th of May 1959, which is in the archives, and that recording by
a military band and the choir definitely has the introduction. And that’s
a long version, by the way. And that’s around.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>So, that’s a long version?</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>That’s a long version. It’s a long way. In fact, there’s some narration
to that and it talks about songs of Singapore, so I do not know. Is it
Radio Singapore? It comes from an open videotape. Whose provenance I don’t
know, we have to find out from the archives. So it could have been a programme
that they broadcast. I have no idea.</p>
<p>And interestingly at around the same time, the date [mentioned in] my
article, the Duke of Edinburgh made a visit to Singapore. And it was a,
he had a giant gigantic parade and assembly on the Padang. And there was
quite an obscure, and we know that the original version of “Majulah Singapura”
was sung at the time, but again, no recordings. And we know that because
I was there for the performance.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Right.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>I was standing in front of it.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Of course, you remember the fanfare?</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Yes, I think so. Can I swear to that? I’m not sure, but I think the fanfare
[was there].</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>It’s been a while.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Because I think I’m trying to remember the date it was, now that the recording
I talked about is 12th May. I think the Duke’s visit was around that time,
not too far. So by that time, I think the fanfare had been there. In fact,
I suspect that the fanfare was there even in November 1958.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>When they first played it.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Yeah. Because it makes sense. Otherwise, it is too plaintive to just start
from there.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>That’s right, too abrupt. Someone must have said “Zubir, you got to tack
on something as an introduction.” And so it would have been easy for them
to have done it. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>After they shortened it and schoolchildren had been singing or mumbling
or mouthing the words, I can’t swear that necessarily all of them necessarily
knew the words, even though they sang it every day. But around about 2000,
there was quite a significant change.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Yes, yes, around 2000. I was chairman of a committee assigned by the government
to have a new orchestration, in effect, a new recording by an orchestra.
And of course, SSO [Singapore Symphony Orchestra] was going to be the orchestra.
And I was tasked with the committee to create this new arrangement. So
of course, what I did, I knew that going public would be no point.</p>
<p>We all knew who the composers in Singapore were. We asked each of them
to submit an orchestration.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>How many of them were there?</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>I think what, six or seven? All the ones I could remember. Kelly Tang
and a few others. Actually Kelly, who was a very gifted composer, submitted
a flamboyant piece, which I really like very much. We thought it’s too
flamboyant for an official version, you know?</p>
<p>Leong Yoon Pin submitted something, but we didn’t select it. And another
composer Phoon Yew Tien, a good friend of mine had refrained from entering
because he didn’t want to compete with his teacher Leong Yoon Pin. So I
told him later, we are not selecting Leong Yoon Pin and his work. Would
you like to try? So he said yes, he tried. And indeed, his version was
the one we selected in the year 2000.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>I’m not sure you can do it on the piano, but what are the major differences?</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>The major differences apart from the fact that the SSO recorded it. Of
course, the SSO had had different recordings previous to that. Okay. With
different composers doing it there was one by an English composer called
Elga Howarth.</p>
<p>And there’s another story attached to that Elga Howarth thing. That was
done before the SSO was established, when the SSO was founded in 1978–79.
A few weeks before the official inauguration concert, the chairman of the
SSO, <a href="https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=b9821423-7c56-4ad2-a709-f141265ba182" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Tan Boon Teik</a>.
I said, “Mr Tan, do you know that the national anthem, which you’re going
to play, has the original version?”</p>
<p>He said, “Is it? Let’s play it.” He was the attorney general. So things
went through my head like is it legal or not, but am I going to question
the attorney general. So I got back. I got the score which was being used
at the time by Elga Howarth, and I added the eight bars.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh, but you edit it based on your memory because you didn’t have the original.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Yes, based on my memory. Because I did not have any score of that.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Right. Right. That only came much later.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Yeah. But later on when we unearthed the early recordings, my memory was
reasonably accurate.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>I’m impressed. That’s an incredible memory you had.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Actually, I had been, to tell the truth, in 1958 and 1959 I had been so
taken up by “Majulah Singapura”. So my own memory and my own history with
“Majulah Singapura” dates back to my school days. I actually made a piano
arrangement of it, which I cannot find. I don’t know where.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh yeah. How old were you?</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>I was like Form 4, Form 5.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Wow. Impressive.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Well, I mean, it was not too difficult to do. But anyway, going back to
the year 2000, we made one other change. The original key of “Majulah Singapura”
is G major. And in that key the highest note is E above C, which is one
octave above C, E5 if I’m right.</p>
<p>It’s not easy to sing for many people. In fact, I didn’t always hit that
note all the time. Now it wasn’t as bad as “The Star-Spangled Banner”,
which is notoriously difficult to sing you know, but it’s such a magnificent
tune, so they retained it. So I thought, hey, this is our chance to make
the anthem singable.</p>
<p>So I propose to lower it from G major to F major. One whole tone down.
This would make the highest note instead of E down to D, which is much
more singable than the E. And so that’s why today the key of the anthem
is F major. But interestingly enough, even though Zubir had written the
original G major, I found one or two printings of the song in F major,
so Zubir Said himself had done it down to F major for certain reasons.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh, I see. So even originally he was maybe possibly toying between F and
G major.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>I think there could be another reason, because if you want it to be played
by a military band, G major is a difficult key. They can do it. But if
you bring it to F major, G major is one sharp, F major is one flat. Now,
most military band instruments are flat key instruments. B-flat, E-flat.</p>
<p>So it would have been easier. It’s possible that they did it for that
reason. Why? I don’t know, like you know, if any of the military men in,
leaders are alive, they could tell you, but I suspect it was for that reason.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay. And did you meet any pushback? Like, you know, people say, how dare
you touch our amazing national anthem.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>No, but here’s an interesting story. I was the chairman of steering committee.
But my friend, who was the key government officer in charge of this, I
won’t name him. He said, the pre-cap meeting, you attend.</p>
<p>I said, “I don’t want to attend. You are the government official. You
attend.” He said, “You are the one who knows music, you attend.”</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>So, I sat for two hours at the Istana waiting for my turn to appear. So
when I appeared, I told this and that, and all the keys and all that sort
of thing. And in fact, I briefed some of the ministers who I knew. People
like Teo Chee Hean – I told him already. So, I didn’t anticipate any problems.</p>
<p>Then at the end of it, after all the questions, Mr Lee Kuan Yew said,
“Professor Tan, can I ask you a question?” “Oh, of course you can.” “Would
it be possible for the orchestra version to be in one key, the choir was
in a different key, and the band was in a different key?”</p>
<p>Actually, of course it would be possible, but it would be very hard to
manage. You know, it would have been possible. So you know what I did?
I told him, “Senior Minister, no, it’s not possible.”</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>That took a lot of time.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Yeah, but you know something? He said, “No problem, okay.” Now, this is
another mystery which future historians have to solve. Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
bless his memory, you know, he did a lot, but music was not his thing.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>That’s right, actually.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>We all know that music was not his thing. He went to SSO concerts, more
or less compelled by Mrs Lee, who was a great supporter of SSO.</p>
<p>There was one particular concert where I sat directly behind Mr Lee, and
he was not paying attention.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Falling asleep?</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Falling asleep or counting the lights or whatever it is. But I think I
can dare to tell this story. I told it in private circles. During the interval,
he put on his programme. He was in the front, the old Victoria Memorial
Hall, people who remember the front row, there was a low parapet. So during
the interval or something, he put his copy of the programme on that parapet.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Halfway during one of the movements of music, he reached out his hand,
he wanted to check something. So he reached out to get the programme. You
know what happened? Mrs Lee slapped his hand, and he withdrew his hand
double quick time. I’m sorry that I did not have a movie camera to record
this, okay, but it happened.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>It makes it very, very human.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Very human. Then in certain affairs I knew who was the boss.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Yes, of course, of course.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>I was glad I witnessed that, you know. But blessed Mrs Lee was a fantastic
supporter of the SSO.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>That’s okay. That’s fantastic. Yeah. But actually, you know, Mr Lee Kuan
Yew’s question was not, even though he was not necessarily musically inclined,
not a bad question.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Not a bad question but I very much doubt he would have understood the
notion of key. I don’t know. He’s not known to be a music lover. He didn’t
play an instrument. I don’t think he reads music. So how come he could
ask this question? We were talking about our current Senior Minister, former
PM Lee Hsien Loong, whose brother, Hsien Yang, both are musical people.
We know that.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>I didn’t know that.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Both of them, I think. What? Certainly. Lee Hsien Loong played the clarinet
in the Catholic High School band and in fact, he was so good at it that
a good friend of mine who was his classmate tells me that he was good enough
to play one movement of Mozart’s Clarinet Concerto at some concert, you
know?</p>
<p>So he was a good clarinetist. Both he and Hsien Yang were music lovers,
you know, and they attended the SSO concerts very often.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Probably not necessarily dragged by the mother, but going willingly.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>I think they are going willingly, I don’t think they went with their mother,
I doubt it.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay. But maybe for the people who are not so necessarily musically aware.
What would be the challenges of having the national anthem in one key for
the orchestra, a different key for the choir, a different key for the military
band?</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Okay, the difficulty would be if you want to sing the national anthem
to the band or to the orchestra, then he would have different vocal demands.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Well, of course it makes sense. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>And the higher tone and the pitch. You can do it of course, you know,
but it would be sort of very not so neat.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Is that done in other national anthems?</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>No, I think in most other national anthems, the key is the official key.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>So, sorry for asking what is obviously a dumb question, but you know.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>I feel like “The Star-Spangled Banner” is very hard to sing because the
notes are very high. But they have never said, okay, let’s lower it so
that everybody can sing.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Right.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>So everyone struggles with the middle part which is impossibly high.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>There’ve been a number of different arrangements of “Majulah Singapura”
besides the orchestral one. And I think one mildly controversial one was
by Ramli Sarip in 2019 and something like that. Right? Dr Rohana.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>She didn’t like it, I think.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>I mean, obviously, it’s her father’s work. Obviously, she’s very upset
with anyone sort of mucking around with it. But you know, what for you
is your own take on the different arrangements or.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Ramli’s performance was simply a solo voice, no instruments, nothing.
So in that, in a way, he had a little bit more freedom with the, first
of all, with the timing, he could stretch his phrases.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>That’s right. Yes, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Secondly, he could sort of… Let’s say a note that could have been held.
He could make it a little different here and there. It was a very, very
personal interpretation.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>It was, wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Very personal.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Very powerful in that way</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>But when I heard it, I was actually quite moved by it. Because there’s
no question that Ramli sang it with deep feeling and love.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>So while it may not have been something that could be used in an official
occasion, it is still a valid performance of “Majulah Singapura”. And you
know, going back to “The Star-Spangled Banner”, you know that they played,
they have this big football thing.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>And of course, some of the performances have been very controversial.
Also likely sang in the same way as well, but Ramli did not do violence
to the “Majulah Singapura”.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>No, no, I think it was very popular.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>It was popular and in fact, as I said, I was supposedly quite touched
and moved by his performance because it was very deeply felt.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>You could definitely feel that, you could feel that, very personal, very
heartfelt.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>That’s great.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Yeah. That’s it. I was actually very moved as well. We won’t say how old
you are, but actually to be honest, you look very young.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Oh, don’t worry, I can tell you I don’t mind. I’m 82 this year.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>82! I have to say, Professor, I remember when I was an undergraduate,
and I would. I don’t want to say how many decades ago, but you know, some
decades ago, and I remember you were the dean of science at the time. And
I have to say, in my memory, you don’t look very different from those many
decades ago.</p>
<p>Oh, so, you know, you obviously have been drinking at the Fountain of
Youth.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Well, I still get people who remember me in the science and industry quiz.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh, in the 60s.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>That was on TV.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Yeah, yeah. This is why TV is so powerful. That’s right. You’ve lived
through a number of different national anthems, right? Right. I think when
you were born, you were born during the Second World War?</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>It would have been “Kimigayo”, the Japanese anthem, which I can’t remember
to tell you the truth.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Of course you were. You were too young.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>But of course, for many years, “God Save the Queen”.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>After that it would be “Negaraku”.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Would have been, 1957. Sorry. The years as an independent, self-governing
body were 1959 to 1963.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>“Majulah Singapura” would have been the state anthem. From 1963 to 1965,
the national anthem was “Negaraku”. But I suppose legally, “Majulah Singapura”
would still be the state anthem.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Yeah, it would be right? Actually that is quite interesting. Right. All
these anthems actually have a very different origin, you know, very few
anthems written apparently as an anthem.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Very few, correct.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>And so actually “Negaraku” is also very interesting because it started
as the Perlis state anthem.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>I think Perak state anthem.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>And it was the state anthem anyway. Before it was a state anthem, it was
inspired by a French love song from the 19th century.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Right. So the various versions of this, one of the versions. I know it’s
in the book by Malaysian composer, Saidah Rastam. The book is <em><a href="https://catalogue.nlb.gov.sg/search/card?id=5aebc594-2942-5abc-93bd-e63c95c12830&amp;entityType=FormatGroup" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Rosalie and Other Love Songs</a></em>.
It is a great book. Okay. This version which I heard was that the then
Sultan of Perak in the 19th century had been exiled to the Seychelles because
of some misdemeanor.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Not a bad place to be exiled.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Yeah, no, but an emissary arrives from Queen Victoria’s court and says,
the Queen would like to have you for tea. Okay, so he goes to Britain.
No, some of the stories here that he then asked, we got to play your state
anthem. What is it? And then this version of the story has his son, who’s
present, quickly hums this tune.</p>
<p>Rosalie hears from the streets of Seychelles, and he tells them this is
the state anthem. Then some of the versions of the story have this happening
only after he arrives in the UK. But anyway, the interesting thing is that
that tune called Rosalie was very, very popular in French chanson. So there’s
some dispute as to who is the composer but no question that it was a French
song popular on the streets of Seychelles. Know what it is?</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Right? Right, right.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Then after that, they were adopted as the Perak state anthem, which it
is to this day.</p>
<p>And then what happens?</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>With the same, with the same words?</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Different. I don’t know what the words are but it cannot be “Negaraku”.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>It cannot be “Negaraku”.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>And after that, the tune has a life of its own. It becomes a popular Malay
song, love song, “Terang Bulan”.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>“Terang Bulan”, right?</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>I mean, that song is so popular that it has a Mandarin version and a Japanese
version.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Cantonese version?</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Mandarin and Japanese.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh, Mandarin and Japanese.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>And it became a very popular tune, very well known within the region.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>And this is before it becomes adopted as the national anthem.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Well before that.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Right.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Then when Malaysia got independence in 1957, Tunku Abdul Rahman says,
we have got to choose the national anthem. So he institutes a worldwide
search. You know, he’s got a competition. I don’t know what to know, whether
it’s actually a competition or just a search.</p>
<p>When I was doing the research for this thing, to my surprise, two eminent
British composers, Benjamin Britten and William Walton, had actually sent
their own versions. And I would love to hear what they said. I even never
heard it. But those versions were not accepted. And then someone says,
you know, the Perak state anthem is very nice.</p>
<p>Why don’t you use it and listen through? Then you decide to use it with
different words. And after that, all other versions not “Negaraku” are
banned. “Terang Bulan” can never be sung as “Terang Bulan”.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh, I see.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Not in Malaysia, at least.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Of course.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>I’m old enough to know “Terang Bulan”. Yeah. Because it is a very well-known
song. It’s one of the most popular Malay songs of that year in the 50s.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>You have had such a long career as a composer, as a professor of physics,
and serving on the board. How do you bring all these things together?</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Very difficult because very difficult to explain this, because like thousands
of other young Singaporeans, but I was, shall I say, forced to learn the
piano. So we learn the piano and all that sort of thing. And of course,
thank god to my mother for forcing me to learn that. Right. And, but I
never thought of music as a career because I knew I was not all that standard
to make it.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>As a performer, you mean?</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>As a performer or anything else.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Well, you’ve been a composer.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>You know at that time, I wasn’t a composer. Oh, maybe I did write a few
things because. Oh, now I remember at the time where the competition for
the national anthem was. In 1963, my late uncle wanted to submit an anthem,
he wrote the words and I wrote the music. Vaguely, I remember this, but
I must look for this.</p>
<p>No, the memory just hit me.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh, right. Right. If you ever. You know, we would love to hear. How old
were you when you wrote it?</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>1963 I would have been, probably the competition was in 1962. I would
have been Pre-U two.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>It’s not bad. I’m sure previously you would have come up with a fairly
decent melody.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Well, okay. But, I knew I would never make it as a professional musician.
In fact, I wanted to be an architect. And I actually applied to Adelaide
University too. And I was admitted. You know, I was admitted. A month before
my departure, I did it, my mother approached me and says, I think you better
don’t do architecture.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>I wanted architecture because it’s a mix of science and the arts.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Yes, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Why can’t I do architecture? You do architecture. You become an architect.
All the contractors will take advantage of you and swindle you. So with
that, I couldn’t challenge it as I gave it up. I gave up, I went to the
University of Singapore to do physics.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay, that’s. That’s amazing.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>I met Ong Teng Cheong and Mrs Ong, you know. Maybe I would have worked
for them. Because they were there.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>At about the same time?</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>About around the same time. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay. Yeah. You could, you could well you know, even though you were not
an architect, you built a lot of other things. You helped found the SSO.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>The SSO of course I’ve written about it in more than one article, but
basically I was lucky to be around. I mean, the story is complicated because
it involved an orchestra. It was the Singapore Philharmonic Orchestra,
which spurred Dr Goh Keng Swee to say this is time to do our own orchestra.
And he called Mr Tan Boon Teik who was chairman of the youth orchestra.
And I think the conversation went something like this. Yeah. Let’s do it
this time. And Goh Keng Swee says, “Hey, we need some young guy to do all
the running around for us. You know?”</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>And you were that?</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Tan Boon Teik said, “I know just one guy.” Sometime in October, I got
a phone call. Me. Just a young lecturer. Go to the DPM office. You know,
and then when I was waiting outside of the DPM’s office to come out. It
was at MINDEF you know?</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>So the SSO was founded at MINDEF.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Who came out of his office was S.R. Nathan, who was then director of SID.
Who are you? I’m in the physics department. Why do you want to see Dr Goh?
I said I haven’t had the faintest idea.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh, really? You didn’t know why you had someone.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>He wasn’t coming out of the office. He was coming in, he had an appointment
before me. So he went into the office and came out many, many years later
when he was giving a farewell lunch for the SSO as they were departing
for some foreign tour.</p>
<p>He said, I tell you all the story that day when I met Bernard at the office,
he doesn’t know this. But when I went in and I told Dr Goh this guy, Bernard
Tan, was waiting for you. “Oh, he doesn’t know what I got in store for
him.” That’s from S.R. Nathan, I cannot prove the veracity of this.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>But it must have been very worrying to be summoned to the office.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Actually by the time I was in his seat, waiting for him, I more or less
figured out that it was going to be about the SSO. I worked closely with
Boon Teik at that time.</p>
<p>So I figured it out. Then as in my article that I have written, he asked
me the three questions, “Is it time that we start an orchestra?” Now, with
Dr Goh, you cannot say “Maybe”, “I don’t know”, all that. Yes or no? I
said yes.</p>
<p>“Who is going to conduct the orchestra?” I was ready, “Choo Hoey. He’s
in Belgium.”</p>
<p>“Where are we going to house the orchestra?”</p>
<p>I was ready. “We can renovate the Victoria Memorial Hall. So those three
questions ultimately led to SSO.”</p>
<p>What actually happened was the orchestra put him in something called the
Singapore Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by a Japanese conductor. This
is a whole different story. Maybe I’ll tell it one day.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>For <em>BiblioAsia</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Oh, maybe, maybe we may. But maybe sealed for 50 years.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh, okay. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>This guy had spurred Dr Goh to tell Tan Boon Teik. Hey, we must do something
about this, you know, set up an orchestra.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>So how did he spur Dr Goh to [set up an orchestra]?</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>He had done a number of things, telling Japanese companies what not, me
claiming to have been given the blessing of Dr Goh, which of course is
true, eventually reached Dr Goh’s ears and he felt he had to do something
about it. That’s why I thank this guy who was spurring [things on] because
this effort, this final successful effort, was not the first one. The many,
many efforts. One of them was done by a Singaporean musician who lives
in Australia called Simplicius Cheong. [He] also wrote a letter. But I
think it didn’t fly because the plans were a bit too grandiose. Okay, so
this Dr Goh said we got to start small. We started the 37. Not the full
symphony orchestra, started with 37 musicians and I remember I was home,
I think.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>One day, I got a call from Dr Goh. “Hey, Bernard, give me a budget for
the SSO tomorrow morning, 9 am.”</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh my god.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>What do I know about the budget?</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh my god.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>So the first thing is how to figure out the expenditure, the most important
musicians’ salaries. I think what I did was okay, Choo Hoey’s salary I
could do. I think he’s like a professor. So give him a professor’s salary.
The musicians are professionals, like engineers. Look up.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh okay.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Engineer’s pay. That actually happened and it came out to be about a million
Singapore dollars.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay. And were you in the ballpark?</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
</p>
<p>Yeah. He said it was okay. Okay. See, that was okay. Of course there’s
this letter. The first [thing I did], after the meeting in his office,
I wrote a letter to Choo Hwee. I sent a copy of the letter to Dr Goh and
he sent me a copy of his letter, which is the only letter I have bearing
his signature, the only one I can find bearing his signature, in which
he scolds me for. And implying to Choo Hoey that we [make] lots of money
and all that sort of thing. And that letter was the one that the National
Museum exhibited.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Dr Goh was famously tight-fisted, right?</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>He was famous for scolding people. Anyway, bless his soul.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>No, but he was such a remarkable person, right? A man of incredible vision.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>It was a privilege for me to have done something for him even though it
was through SSO.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Right. So, now you are 80-what years old?</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>This year, it will be 82 in a few months.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy|</strong>
<br>And you’re still teaching at NUS.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>I’m still teaching one course per semester.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>That’s amazing.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>And the course I’m teaching is something I’ve been teaching for the last
25 years. It’s called the Science of Music.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh, that’s really interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>It was a well-known course, because anybody can take it. Now, I think
you have to be in the College of Humanities and Science, and then you’ve
got to have some prerequisite. But for 20 years I taught it with no prerequisites.
It was what they called a module that anybody could take to fulfil your
other requirements. And in the course I talk about science, the scientific
foundations, music, how skills are created, why musical instruments sound
different from each other. And then I talk about electronic music and all.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Is it very popular? I’m sure it must be very popular.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>I capped it at 200 students. In fact, when I first started it in 1999
or 2000, like 400 students every semester and I gave two projects, and
the projects are such that I cannot share the marking. So every year I
marked 1,000 projects.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh, my god.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>One project was to attend a concert and give me a review.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>And I have an ulterior motive for that, because I want to make sure these
guys attend one concert in their whole lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>All right, okay.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>In fact, that’s very useful for me because even today when I read their
essays, wow I learn a lot about K-pop. This and that, it’s so. I mean an
80-year-old guy. I can keep abreast of things happening. And the other
project is, they have to use a programme to create a piece of music. It’s
a composition project.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh, right.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>And it’s very interesting because I find that even though you don’t know
music, you can still create something which is not nonsense. It may not
be Beethoven, but it still makes some sense, you know? So I still do this,
every semester.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay. You sound very animated when you talk about. So it obviously must,
must, must give you a lot of joy. Maybe not the marking.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Well, even the marking, while it’s tedious. I learned a lot of interesting
things from the concert reviews and listening to their music. It’s quite
interesting. You know what? Some of the best pieces that people will send
me must have come from actual musicians, obviously students. But some of
them are really very good.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Are you a K-pop fan as a result of this?</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Am I a K-pop fan? I must be honest and say I don’t think so. No, not yet.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>But it’s not only K-pop. They tell me about all of the visiting artists
who come and do pop concerts. So it helps you to keep up the rest of what’s
going on.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>You’ve likened scientific research to writing music. How is that?</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>It’s through the definition of creativity, creativity in writing music,
like painting and all that. We understand this, right? It’s a kind of innovation
to draw things in you. You re-synthesise things. But scientific research
is not often thought of as a creative process. But let me tell you, more
scientists think of scientific research as creative process because you
have to resynthesise existing theories and have new explanations</p>
<p>It is my belief that the creative impulse in scientific research is no
different from that in the artistic.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Right. So it’s just an expression.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>It’s an expression of the same emotive drive. I’m very convinced of this.
That’s why I think that when you want to encourage creativity, you can
do it in so many ways. In fact, for like five or six years, I ran an interdisciplinary
seminar called creativity in the arts, science and technology and we had
a lot of guest speakers, composers, artists, scientists coming to talk.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh, it sounds very interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>I ran this for about six years until the money ran out. This was during
the late 90s.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>You are very humble and you say you’re not like the world’s best composer,
but you have composed music that has been played by the Singapore Youth
Orchestra, if I recall correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Yes, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>And others, you know, have you been composing anything recently?</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>You mentioned Youth Orchestra, when I was chairman for 20 years, we instituted
the policy of commissioning one work by a single composer every year. So
there’s a body of work with the Youth Orchestra. With the SSO, when it
started, it had its ups and downs relating to single composers.</p>
<p>I do remember that there was a bit of a kerfuffle between, okay, even
before Lan Shui. Choo Hoey had been criticised by some of my colleagues
for not playing enough Singapore composers’ works. But he did so later
on when Lan Shui came in. I think that was a bit of a kerfuffle between
him, because I think in an interview he was alleged to sort of criticise
Singapore composers.</p>
<p>I can’t remember how that ended, but I think we brought the two sides
together. But Lan Shui has been quite good, actually. He has actually played
a lot of it. He’s played a lot of my work. I’ve written four concertos.
The piano concerto for Toh Chee Hung.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>The violin concerto for Lynnette Seah, the guitar concerto for this young
man, Kevin Loh, who was making waves all around the world today. The cello
concerto for Noella Yan, the cellist who lives in Australia.<strong> </strong>And
right now I have been stuck for the last five years. I blame the pandemic
on a harmonica concerto.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>A harmonica concerto, there’s such a thing?</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Why harmonica? The reason is this. People asked me why I didn’t write
a concerto for er hu and all. Now, I don’t think I want to be like some
people who just dash into it before knowing the traditions of Chinese music.
I may do that one day. But I chose harmonica as my next one because I wanted
to write something that was the resonant with the Chinese-speaking community,
whom I know very well because in fact, some of my closest friends, both
in science and music, are from the Chinese-speaking community.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>All right.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Because in both areas, the Chinese school students have always dominated
in music and science. Well the harmonica, though it’s a Western instrument,
it has long resonated with the Chinese-speaking community because after
the Second World War, when people didn’t have any money, the masses in
China, Korea and Japan took up the harmonica where it remains till today
a very popular instrument because it’s cheap.</p>
<p>For a few dollars you can buy a harmonica. So I’ve been working on the
harmonica concerto. I’ve got the first and third movements. I even have
someone in Singapore who was a very good harmonica player. While I’ve been
stuck on the second movement, which is the shortest movement for the last
five years, I think I must.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Five years for just the second movement?</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>I have to do it within the next year.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>I hope so. We’re putting this on the record so you know, we will hold
you to this.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Oh thank you, thank you. Okay, I will try it. I will try, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>I was just wondering. I have two more questions. One, can you play something
for us that you’ve composed?</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>I wrote something for my son’s wedding but I don’t know where it is.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Okay? Okay. And the other question that has always bothered me. And maybe
you are the right person who can answer this. Why were you all forced to
play the recorder? Not a harmonica. I mean.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>That is a good question because we were under the British school system.
And of course, the British and the European and the Western people were
looking for a cheap instrument, I mean, if you mandated the clarinet, which
would have cost hundreds, if not thousands of dollars. So the recorder,
which is actually a Baroque instrument, 500–600 years old, is a wooden
piece with holes.<strong> </strong>Very simple and very cheap to make.
So it became the standard musical teaching instrument in British schools.
So that was the legacy of British education.</p>
<p>The recorder is not just a child. It is a serious instrument because there
are different sizes. And I have to say that it did contribute quite a bit
to the music because many people who played the recorder were like “Oh,
this is such a similar instrument, I want to learn something else.” So
they would go on and learn the oboe and all that. What about the piano?
The piano obviously would have been an instrument that many people learned,
but how many people could afford a piano, you know. So even though you
look at the musical exam, music examinations, more than 90 percent are
piano candidates. Yeah. Likewise with the violin. I mean even a cheap China-made
violin is a few hundred dollars, you know. So it was costly. Whereas a
harmonica like the recorder is a few dollars.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>That’s right. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>So no problem. It was a real problem with money, especially after the
war.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Well I have to say, numerous teachers who, in my recollection, did not
probably know how to play the recorder themselves, attempted to teach bored
and unwilling students. And this is my memory of learning how to play the
recorder, which I still cannot play.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>I think I was one of those unwilling students, all of us. Well, the recorder
is relatively easy to learn to play a tune.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>It is? Okay. Maybe I shall revisit the recorder.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Yes. But actually, what actually happened in the 50s, the phenomenon was
not the recorder, not the piano, but the electric guitar.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Yes, the electric guitar.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>It has changed people’s lives, actually.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Yes, right?</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>And the Beatles. Yes. And I mean, if you learned to play the electric
guitar in theory, you can play the classical guitar because the fingering
is the same. It’s the same, absolutely. But, here I think I will mention
that I’m a little agnostic with respect to this type of music. For example,
my students, when they write about the concert, you can write about pop,
rock, whatever classical, I don’t care. As long as it is music, you know?
And when I was in that time, during the 50s, when I was in Form 4, Form
5, I was a keen fan of the Beatles. I have many LP records of the Beatles.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh, fantastic. I’m a fan as well.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Because their genius was obvious to people like us. Maybe not to others,
you know, but in my later years, I sort of lost touch with pop music, and
I reconnected later in the 90s you know, but in the 1950s and 1960s. People
forget that in the 50s and 60s, that was the golden age of Singapore Pop
music.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>It was. So many original bands playing original music.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Well, the two famous bands were <a href="https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=3900ef93-3ab8-42a2-8b77-3b88cca07adf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">The Quests</a> and
<a href="https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=85cabf85-cee5-4712-a016-efa5ef754036" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">The Crescendos</a>. I think Reggie Verghese is still around. The Crescendos
were a vocal group. And the lead singer, I don’t remember her name.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Susan.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Susan Lim, you’re right.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Susan Lim, I think, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>The sad part of the story is that she went swimming at Kota Tinggi and
went behind a rock and was never seen again.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>I know, it was such a tragedy.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Such a tragic story. Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>And she was very young.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>She was very young. Yeah. Very, very young. Of course I know her sister
and they don’t have a body to grieve, but. But The Crescendos and The Quests
were almost certainly the two most popular, most successful groups.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Yeah, you’re right. That was the golden age of Singapore pop. I don’t
know; I’m not really sure why that was, because you know you had the Beatles,
you had the Rolling Stones and yet you still had The Quests.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>And I think it was a question of this enormous energy coming up from the
birth of rock. Just overcame everybody. And I think it was a good thing
because strangely enough, I think that was a period when classical music
may have been in its doldrums. And I always like to say that we think of
classical music as the music that defines history. No, that’s not true.
If you look at the history of music in the early part of the 20th century,
jazz defines music. Then after that it’s rock that defines music. And these
are also the people’s music. And most of the musical energy of that time
was I think not in classical but in pop and rock basically.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>I think so, I mean not that I’m an expert on music, but you know, we certainly
talk about jazz and rock in the 20th century much more than we talk about
classical music.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>And in fact, though we often go down in American culture and all that,
I thank American culture for being the progenitors of jazz and rock. Absolutely.
Which have stayed with us till today, really defining the whole of pop
music, even influenced classical music to a very great extent.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>Oh, really? How?</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>Because, if you look at for example, jazz influence, many, many composers,
particularly a group of French composers, who used jazzy idioms in their
music.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>All right. Right, right.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard</strong>
<br>But of course now, music is very eclectic. Classical music is broken out
of its very esoteric bonds, pseudo music and all that. Then today you’re
not beholden to any style. You can write classical music or any sort. And
what you try to do is, like all classical music, make it meaningful, well-constructed
and that kind of thing.</p>
<p>And Singapore today has many promising young composers, you know, and
there was a time I, I’m told today that I’m the oldest classical composer
in Singapore because after Mr Leong passed away. But [among] the younger
generation there are many, many excellent composers now. So the future
of classical music composing in Singapore is actually quite assured.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>
<br>That’s wonderful to hear. Prof, I want to thank you for coming on the
show. I want to thank you also for inviting us into your lovely house and
for talking to us, and for giving us the three different versions of the
national anthem that you know, so kindly play it for us today, to hear
more or to learn more about the national anthem, “Majulah Singapura” and
about national anthems in general.</p>
