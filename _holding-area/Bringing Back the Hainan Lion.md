#### **The unexpected find of a cape with tiger markings in the storeroom of the Guang Wu Club led a martial artist and lion dance master to revive a lost art form in Singapore.**

When martial artist and lion dance master Raymond Foo, the head of 光武国术团 (Guang Wu Guoshu Tuan or Guang Wu Club), was about 15 years old, he chanced upon a cape with tiger markings in the club’s storeroom. He had come across the Hainan lion in photos and trained in martial arts and lion dance since he was 12, but no one could tell him what this striped cape was.&nbsp; His quest for answers brought him to Hainan Island and set him on a path to reviving and preserving an art form lost to Singapore.
