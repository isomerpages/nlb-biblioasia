The beginnings of the Chinese book industry in Singapore can be traced back to the 1910s, when book companies from China set up branches here. The Commercial Press and Chung Hwa Book Company were the first and sold mainly their own publications and textbooks. In the 1920s, when Cheng Hing Company (later known as World Book Company) and Shanghai Book Company were established, a wider variety of Chinese publications from China became available. By the early 1940s, the number of Chinese bookstores in Singapore had increased to 22, mostly located at South Bridge Road. The five largest were The Commercial Press, Chung Hwa Book Company, World Book Company, Shanghai Book Company and Nanyang Book Company, which was founded locally in 1935.

Although many bookstores were destroyed during World War II, the industry managed to recover and began to publish local edited works, as there was a shortage of supply from China due to civil wars. During the boom of the 1950s and early 1960s, more local bookstores were set up for students. The Youth Book Company, a major industry player, led the trend of publishing local works, which helped to encourage the creation of a local literary scene.

However the industry suffered a setback in the 1970s, when changes in Singapore’s education policy gave less emphasis to the Chinese language and spurred the growth of English bookstores. The closure of Nanyang University and the enforced merger of *Nanyang Siang Pau* and *Sin Chew Jit Poh* in the 1980s marked the decline of the Chinese book industry in Singapore. Though the industry today is still supported by demand from the older generation of readers, the internet has made business survival even more challenging.

新加坡是一个移民城市国家，自1819年开埠至今已 经走过一百九十多年历史。在今天500多万人口中， 超过75%的人口比例是华人。而这些华人，他们或 者是移民的后代，或者是新移民。他们将别无选择， 无从逃避地面对身为海外华人对于自己母族语言，文 化，传统，习俗的传承选择。这不是什么问题，而仅 仅是一个现实存在，一个需要面对的事实。

当年新加坡华文书业的兴起，支撑了新马乃至 整个南洋地区的华文教育事业。我们很难设想，如果 没有当年华文书业源源不断提供的教科书，以及其他 各类书籍，幼童的启蒙，学校的教育，社会的进步， 文化的发展，都将从何谈起？

人们常说，华社，华校，华文报纸是坚持和维 护华族语言、文化、传统的重要堡垒。事实上，是华 文书业，提供了最初始的书籍支援，奠定了最基本的物质基础，尤其是在为早期华校提供教科书方面，华 文书业前辈在遥远异乡的土地上，用华文书滋养华族 后代，让他们可以延续华文华语的能力，得以传承发 展华社、华校、华文报的社会职能和历史使命。

本文尝试对新加坡华文书业的历史做一个简单 回顾和梳理，从而了解期间的发展过程。
