The National Library of Singapore is the custodian of Singapore’s published heritage. One of the statutory functions mandated by the National Library Board Act is the Legal Deposit, which empowers the National Library to collect published works by writers and publishers in Singapore. Under the act, publishers are required by law to deposit two copies of every work published in Singapore – within four weeks of its publication – with the National Library. 

The Legal Deposit is not a new concept: it is an important function of national libraries all over the world. Legal Deposit helps build the national collection by ensuring that the country’s published heritage is systematically collected and preserved for posterity.

A secondary role is making the collection accessible to the public. Given the ephemeral nature of information in the Internet age, Legal Deposit is especially important as it is an archived collection and preservation system for Singapore’s print heritage, and in time to come, electronic and web content.

#### **History of Legal Deposit in Singapore**

The European origins of Legal Deposit can be traced to the Ordonnance de Montpellier (Ordinance of Montpellier) signed by King Francois I of France on 28 December 1537, when it was first 
applied as a mechanism to control and censor dissenting theologies. This legal instrument was expanded in the 16th century in order to build a national collection in France; it was subsequently adopted by several European countries such as 
Germany and Britain.

In Singapore, the Legal Deposit function has its roots in the British government’s Indian Act XI of 1835, which required printers and publishers to conform to rules governing public information. 
With the passing of the Book Registration Ordinance of 1886, the Raffles Library and Museum became the designated Legal Deposit library for all books published in the Straits Settlements 
(Singapore, Malacca and Penang). 

The enactment of the Raffles National Library Ordinance, which came into force on 1 April 1958, marked an important milestone in 
the history of the National Library. The ordinance mandated the National Library as the depository library for all materials published and printed in Singapore, a function that was continued 
under the Printers and Publishers Act in 1970 and subsequently under the National Library Board Act in 1995
