#### A coterie of women sculptors in Singapore has successfully redefined this once male-dominated art form. **Nadia Arianna Bte Ramli** tells you more.

“If I showed up in a feminine dress like this, people don’t believe I’m a sculptor!”[^1] 
<p align="right">– Elsie Yu</p>

Whether the medium is granite, bronze, steel or clay, the art of shaping, moulding and chiselling the material into a sculptural work of art demands more than brute strength. Yet, some hold the view that the art form requires certain masculine qualities in order to bend, carve or shape even the most malleable of materials into what may be deemed a “feminine” sculpture. What does gender have to do with art? The question was raised by Susie Lingham in the Text & Subtext forum in 2000:

“In sports events, men and women’s events are separated on the argument that men have more physical strength. But in art, is there a necessity to set up another ring for women artists to wrestle for relevance in the art world? Is this not a way of marginalising women?”2

Women sculptors around the world,including those in Singapore, have wrestled countless obstacles in order to pursue their artistic passions. From sourcing of materials and seeking funds and opportunities to exhibit their works, to struggling with competing priorities and the challenges of being an artist in a monetised capitalist society, these are all admittedly not gender-specific issues. They are issues that all artists face – regardless of gender.

In spite of these obstacles, women sculptors in Singapore, from Kim Lim to Kumari Nahappan, have carved out certain success from whatever materials they could lay their hands on. The fruits of their labour stand in public, private and commercial spaces – a testament to the grit and gumption as well as the creative talents of a small but influential group of women sculptors in Singapore.

#### **From Decoration to Art**

Records show that a pioneer exhibition of women’s work was held in October 1931 at the Young Women’s Christian Association in Singapore. Works of artistic merit were grouped together along with “useful” crafts. A newspaper notice for the exhibition states that it included “all kinds of sewing, embroidery, art work, photography, cooking… by the young married women who are just beginning to realise the delights of making artistic and useful things”.3 In those early days, art by women seemed to be largely decorative in nature and merely a leisurely pursuit by women with time on their hands.

In the 1930s, a European sculptor by the name of Dora Gordine lived and worked in Singapore and Johor. During her time here, she was commissioned to create three sculptures for the Municipal Building (later renamed as the City Hall until its recent reincarnation as the National Gallery Singapore [NGS] together with the Supreme Court building next door).

The sculptures were of three heads depicting an Indian, a Chinese and a Malay.4 These bronze busts were crafted in the classical tradition of “universal and idealised human forms” in three-dimensional style.5 The purchase of these art works for the Municipal Building was described as a watershed event: “the first time in the history of this Colony that the acquisition of a subject of pure art has been realised”.6

Coming at a time when most of the sculptures in the colony took the form of busts or statues, and were largely commemorative or decorative in nature, Gordine’s works of “pure art” were indeed welcome acquisitions. Today, these sculptures can be found in the Singapore Gallery of the NGS.

Beyond the Western community of artists, annual art exhibitions such as those held by the Singapore Art Society drew local artists to the fore. On 22 September 1955, the society held the first art show by Malayan women artists: altogether 60 compositions from 42 women from Malaya and Singapore were selected from 120 artistic submissions. Mrs Dorothy Bordass, chairman of the organising committee, was hopeful that the endeavor would encourage artistic expressions of local subject matter by local talents:

“The number of entries and the excellent, creative quality of individual canvases indicate that Malaya’s women artists are finding encouragement in self-expression in local subject matter. Art can offer Malaya’s women rewarding careers. Very little has been done so far to encourage artistic expression…It is our hope that women artists thus will be encouraged to advance their talents.”7

Art teachers and students were encouraged to showcase their talents by taking part in exhibitions. One such teacher was Mrs A. Gunaratnam. A former teacher at Raffles Girls’ School, one of her plaster sculptures fetched the highest price for an artwork at a 1950 Singapore Art Society exhibition.8 Priced at $500, this was a very respectable sum of money in those days for an artwork by a relatively unknown person.

Mrs Gunaratnam was one of the very few women sculptors in Singapore then, having begun exhibiting her works since 1948. Her talent did not go unnoticed – she sat on the selection committee for a 1951 art exhibition, alongside local pioneer artist Liu Kang and the last British Director of the Raffles Museum in Singapore, Dr Carl Alexander Gibson-Hill.9 One of her sculptured portrait busts, “Mavis – A Study” (1950), was described by the art historian T. K. Sabapathy as remarkable for the time, with her attention to both anatomical details and characterisation.10  Mrs Gunaratnam’s reputation grew, and her statues and sculptures were even bought by private collectors in India and England.

While women artists were progressively moving beyond the home and expanding their artistic horizons, some were still caught in a bind between domestic responsibilities and their artistic inclinations.

At a women-only art exhibition in 1975, held in celebration of International Women’s Year, some artists believed that women had finally achieved complete independence while others felt that, unlike their male counterparts, some women had to sacrifice their artistic ambitions and turn their attention to the home and the needs of the family first.11 This tension between social responsibilities and individual expression is a continued source of conversation for women working on sculpture and heavy art installation works even until today.12

#### **A Collective Consciousness**

In 2001, a cross-cultural collaboration exhibition, “Women Beyond Borders”, with its aim to establish a community of women’s voices and visions, ended its world tour with its Singapore exhibition.Initiated by a group of American women artists, “Women Beyond Borders: Singapore” was primarily a women’s project. It saw established women artists as well as female members of the public creating sculptures, specifically, transforming a pinewood box, measuring a mere 2.5 by 3 by 2.5 inches, into a work of art.13 The exhibition’s focus was “not on account that they are women that alone made such work invaluable, but because largely owing to the theme, they reveal nuggets of thoughts and insights on themselves as women”.14

At the Singapore edition of the exhibition, now leading artists such as Kumari Nahappan, Yvonne Lim and Suzann Victor were but a few of the women who created small but powerful sculptures from the boxes they were handed out. This global inquiry of what it meant to be a woman through art drew attention to the larger liberties afforded to women across national boundaries, providing a united yet diverse voice for the effort.

A decade earlier, art by women and about women was also the focus of the landmark 1991 National Museum Art Gallery exhibition, “Women and Their Art”, curated by Susie Koay. It was a defining moment for the women’s art scene in Singapore, given that the last all-female exhibition was held more than 30 years ago. Diana Chua’s sculpture of a female torso, “In Between No.11”, wrapped in mirror shards beneath a veneer of gauze, veered away from the conventional sensuality of smooth torsos and curved, inviting forms. This juxtaposition between hard and soft, and male and female, was just one of the many artworks that redefined “the stereotyped image of the female artist as one who paints pretty things” to “a serious artist of serious issues”.15

A growing community of women artists, though not necessarily feminist artists – there is a difference – was further shaped by art forums such as Huangfu Binghui’s Text & Subtext and artist collectives such as Women In The Arts (WITAS)16 and 5th Passage Artists Ltd. While these initiatives were not art-form specific, women sculptors also benefitted from the focus on the representation and network of women artists they could tap into. With diverse dialogues and initiatives, women’s art and issues took shape within the community.

#### **Shaping Interests**

Sculpture as an art form in Singapore has generally been a less-travelled terrain in comparison with other art forms such as painting and pottery. Sabapathy described the entry of sculpture into the local art world as “rather timid and inconspicuous”, first appearing sporadically in the 1950s in expositions that were otherwise dedicated to paintings.17

At the opening of the first exhibition dedicated to sculptural works in 1967, then deputy Prime Minister Toh Chin Chye called on artists to “organise a little movement to kindle the country’s interest in sculptured art” that “could give life and beauty to the vast bareness of the city”.18 Fast forward 15 years later to 1982, Sabapathy noted the continued interest in painting over sculpture:

“It has been 15 years since the first national exposition. This neglect is a symptom of the condition of sculpture here. There is little doubt that it is secondary to painting, which dominates the art world here. The demands of the art market have only served to entrance the primacy of painting. The portable picture is mobile and seemingly self-effacing in that it is absorbed into the wall. This enhances it as a commercial product and commodity.”19

Women sculptors were thus venturing into what was a relatively small space in the arts scene. The hefty cost of creating sculptural exhibitions may be (and still is) a strain for some. 1995 Cultural Medallion recipient Han Sai Por’s “20 Tonnes – Physical Consequences” (2002) cost about $20,000 to create, while construction costs alone for Elsie Yu’s “Towards Excellence” (1987) was a whopping $80,000.20
