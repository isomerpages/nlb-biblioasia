<b>SPY MUSIC</b>
<br><br>
The music[^1] for <i>Five Ashore in Singapore</i> was composed by renowned French composer Antoine Duhamel, who had just begun his career by scoring French New Wave films by legendary directors Jean-Luc Godard and François Truffaut. At the request of <i>Five Ashore</i>’s director Bernard Toublanc-Michel, he composed <i>Somewhere in Singapore</i> (also known as the Marines’ March – “La marche des Marines” in French) with lyrics by Jimmy Parramore.

<br><br>
Quite brazenly, the song was directly based on the melody of the now iconic <i>[Yellow Submarine](https://google.com)</i>, the Beatles’ number one hit in 1966. Indeed, Toublanc-Michel had asked his actors who played the five Marines to stride out of Clifford Pier with the Beatles’ song playing in their heads, so as to lend a certain rhythm to their swagger.
<br><br>
Other melodies with no lyrics composed by Duhamel include <i>Paradise Limited</i> for the club scene and <i>Thème de la drogue</i> (the drug theme) for the opium den scene. </span>

Anthologies are a popular format for comics. A number of collections have been published over the years and these have helped to bring many artists to prominence.<br><br>
<b>PAST...</b><br>
漫画同盟 (<i>Comics Alliance</i>) – a four-volume anthology series published in 1997, 1998 and 2001 – is a compilation of Chinese comics by various Singaporean comic artists. The books are edited by comic veterans Wee Tian Beng and Wee See Heng.

The <i>Liquid City</i> anthology, the brainchild of Sonny Liew, brought together a star-studded cast of artists who contributed short comics that have been compiled in three volumes. The series has received much attention, with volume two being nominated for Best Anthology Series at the 2011 Eisner Awards. Many of the participating artists went on to produce their own comic books. Otto Fong, a contributor to the anthology, said: “The experience of being in an anthology and working alongside other comics artists spurred my competitiveness.”[^2]<br><br>
