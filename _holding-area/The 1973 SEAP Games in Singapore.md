It was September 1973 and the stakes were high for Singapore, and for Singapore’s “Golden Girl” Patricia Chan. It was the 7th Southeast Asian Peninsular (SEAP) Games, the precursor to today’s Southeast Asian Games, and the event was being held in Singapore for the first time.

One of the biggest international sporting events to be hosted by Singapore since becoming independent, it was a matter of pride for the young nation. There was a desire to show, not only that the country was able to host an event like this, but that it would also do well in the medal tally. For the latter, all eyes were on Singapore’s star athletes, and in particular swimming sensation Pat Chan.

Chan’s haul of 33 gold medals from the previous four SEAP Games – an average of eight golds per event – meant that the much of hopes of the nation would rest on her young shoulders. However, the 1973 games were going to be a different kettle of fish for the 19-year-old. In an effort to improve her physical fitness ahead of the games, Chan had plunged into her training, determined to work extra hard. However, in this case, working hard turned out to be counterproductive as she ended up tearing “the muscle on my back, my shoulder blade… So it was very difficult. It wasn’t a bad tear but it was very, very painful. Every stroke hurts. And this was two weeks before the competition”.[^1]

Fortunately for Chan, and for Singapore, all went well. Chan managed to snag six gold and Singapore secured a remarkable second place in the overall medal tally, just behind Thailand.

The nation also acquitted itself well to the watching world. The newly built National Stadium was a fitting venue for the opening and closing ceremonies, while other stadiums around Singapore helped to host some of the events. Interestingly, the games also cleverly leveraged on the newly built housing estate of Toa Payoh. The games village used Housing and Development Board (HDB) apartment blocks in Toa Payoh to house officials and athletes, while the nearby Toa Payoh Sports Complex was the venue for swimming events and athletics. Even the building housing the secretariat found a new and important post-games life.

#### **A New Stadium for the Games**
Interestingly, Singapore had originally been invited by the SEAP Games Federation Council to host an earlier edition of the SEAP Games. However, they were turned down as Singapore felt that it did not have the facilities, particularly a national stadium, to embark on such a venture. “Until then, we are not ready for anything,” said President of the Singapore Olympic and Sports Council Othman Wok when he announced in 1967 that Singapore would not be able to host the 5th SEAP Games.[^2]
 
Getting a proper stadium was thus the first job at hand. Located on the former runways of Kallang Airport and the grounds of the former Kallang Park, the stadium took six years to build, from December 1966 to June 1972. It boasted a distinct brutalist design, adorned with a stunning array of monumental columns and heroic diagonal beams, complemented by expansive rake-seating terraces. The megastructure also featured four imposing floodlights and a daring 20-metre-high cantilevered roof that gracefully extended over the grandstand.[^3]

It was officially declared opened by Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew on 21 July 1973, just two months before the SEAP games. At the opening, Lee noted that the $50-million stadium would not be profitable. “In fact, we shall be lucky to get enough receipts to pay for the annual administrative and maintenance costs,” he said. “However, as a social investment, fully and properly used, it can be made a great asset… people will be encouraged to watch, and then to personally take part in sporting activities.”[^4]

#### **Toa Payoh Games Village**
Just as important as the sporting facilities were the ancillary facilities such as the games secretariat and the games village. Instead of purpose-built housing or student dorms, the 1,500 competitors and officials were housed in four newly completed 25-storey-high HDB apartment blocks in Toa Payoh, each with 96 units.[^5]

The housing estate was chosen as the Games Village because the flats were “ideally located and surrounded by all the necessary facilities and amenities” such as a new swimming complex with five pools and a sports complex with a 400 m running track. Athletes could also avail themselves of the nearby cinemas, an emporium, 180 shops, a supermarket, a post office, a bus terminal, a hawker centre and a medical centre.[^6]

“For the first time competitors will be housed in high rise flats and this will be a change for SEAP Games athletes who have lived in makeshift two-storey apartments and students’ hostels,” said E.W. Barker, president of the Singapore National Olympics Council and Othman Wok.[^7]

Each flat – with three bedrooms and a hall – was shared by six athletes and furnished with the “amenities of a luxurious hotel room”. [^8]The games village received a thumbs-up from athletes. “The organisers have done a wonderful job in providing first class accommodation,” said Singapore veteran hurdler Osman Merican. “What surprised me was the gang of women workers marching into our rooms in the mornings and tidying our beds and mopping up the caterers. This is something I have not experienced in other international games”.[^9]

The SEAP Games Village was declared open by Deputy Prime Minister Goh Keng Swee on 30 August 1973. To mark the occasion, Goh planted a Hop tree in the village centre while the heads of the contingents from the other participating countries also planted their own trees. Goh noted: “\[A\]s you can see for yourself, and as the tree-planting ceremony is intended to symbolise, this satellite town is not really a concrete jungle.” [^10] (After the games, the flats were sold through a balloting exercise at $19,000 each, with an additional $1,700 for furnishings.)

The secretariat for the games was a three-storey building that was also in Toa Payoh. After the games, it became the Toa Payoh Branch Library, which opened on 7 February 1974.[^11]

#### **Let the Games Begin**
The opening ceremony of the 7th SEAP Games on 1 September 1973 was described as the “most colourful” ceremony Singapore had ever witnessed at the time. Shown live on television, the ceremony commenced with the arrival of President of Singapore, Benjamin Sheares, followed by the singing of the National Anthem and the introduction of the athletes from the seven participating nations – Burma (now Myanmar), Khmer Republic (now Cambodia), Laos, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and South Vietnam.[^12]

In their striking crimson jackets for male athletes and cream for female, the Singapore contingent emerged onto the running track where they were greeted by the frenzied cheers of an enthusiastic crowd of 50,000 spectators.&nbsp;

The Singapore contingent was 454 athletes strong, and included swimming sensations Pat Chan and Elaine Sng, track stars Heather Merican and Gloria Barnabas, high jumper Noor Azhar Abdul Hamid, and judokas Tan Sin Aun, Wong Kin Jong and Kan Kwok Toh.[^13]
  
After Barker’s welcome speech, President Sheares officially declared the games open. The blue and white SEAP Games flag was unfurled amid the “ringing sound of a trumpet fanfare”, and accompanied by the release of some 19,000 multi-hued balloons and a 21-gun salute.

The theme song was performed by the 2,000-strong Combined Schools Choir as Singaporean sprinter C. Kunalan, dressed in an all-white track suit, carried the SEAP flame into the stadium to light the torch perched at the highest point of the stadium.[^14] (David Lim Kim San, a music inspector from the Ministry of Education, composed the music for the song titled “The SEAP Games Theme Song”, with lyrics by E.W. Jesudason, the former principal of Raffles Institution.[^15])

In a solemn tone, swimmer Pat Chan took the SEAP oath on behalf of all participating athletes, pledging their commitment to “take part in the Games in fair competition, respecting the regulations which govern them, and with the desire to participate in the true spirit of sportsmanship for the honour of our country and the glory of sport”.[^16]
