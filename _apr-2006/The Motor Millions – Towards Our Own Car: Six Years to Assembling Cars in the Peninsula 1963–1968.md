 #### Traces Malaysia’s attempt to establish a local automotive assembly industry during the exciting years of industrialisation from 1963 to 1968.
 
#### **Political Backdrop and Automobile Framework in the Early 1960s**
In May 1961, then Malaya’s Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, suggested the formation of Malaysia – comprising the integration of the three Borneo territories on approximately the same basis as the existing state of the Federation of Malaya, along with Singapore merging with the Federation with somewhat more autonomy. Thus, Malaysia was established on 31 August 1963 with the purpose to reduce or eliminate the threat of communism and secure independence from colonial rule. Singapore, it had been feared, would, if permitted to achieve separate independence, become a ‘Cuba’ at the bottom of the Peninsula (Deputy Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak in Washington, *Malayan Times*, 27 April 1963). Independence, it seemed, would mean industrialisation would be a necessary evil.

The seeds of what was to become a major industry in Malaysia were sown by then Malaysian Minister of Commerce and Industry, Dr Lim Swee Aun, in 1963. On his way to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Conference (GATT) in Geneva that year, Dr Lim confirmed that his ministry had received many inquiries from foreign and local firms regarding the possibility of setting up vehicle manufacturing factories in the Federation. The bigger plan, he subsequently announced, was to establish a motor vehicle industry in Malaysia by stages – from basic assembly with some local content, to chassis build, and finally to a fully local-made car.
