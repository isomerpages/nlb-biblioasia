#### **Introduction**

In 1900, British traveller and sometime political activist Ethel Colquhoun
visited Singapore during a tour of the Pacific with her husband, an imperial
administrator and explorer. During a stay of several days, she recorded
her views on the landscape and society that she observed. One of the
most striking and critical passages of her account deals with Singapore’s
European residents:


  *They live in the baleful atmosphere of a hothouse. They are exiles<br> 
  and prisoners on a cramped little island, from which they cannot<br> 
  even escape for a short holiday at times, only to go “home”. They<br> 
  naturally get to regard Singapore as the hub of the universe, and<br> 
  to feel as if the whole creation centred round their tiny world of<br> 
  small civil, military and mercantile duties. They can’t exercise<br> 
  charity to their poorer neighbours – for neither Chinese nor Malays<br>  are exactly subjects for my Lady Bountiful – so that it is not<br>  perhaps wonderful that that much-abused virtue gets rusty in their<br>    intercourse with social equals*.1

Throughout the period 1870–1920, during which Singapore was
administered as part of the Crown Colony of the Straits Settlements within
the British Empire, visitors and residents were keen to record their thoughts
on the island’s European community. While some accounts were written
by travellers passing through, others recorded the experiences of men and
women who had spent longer periods living and working in British Malaya.

Colquhoun’s comments reflect several key themes that appear throughout
many contemporary accounts. Discussions of the nature of society are
rooted in ideas of separation and isolation, the relationship with Britain as
“home”, and interactions between racial and occupational groups. While
many accounts follow Colquhoun’s lead and criticise the way of life they
observe among the European population, others present a more favourable
view, highlighting the perceived benefits of a tropical lifestyle, the strengths
of the small European community in Singapore and what they believed
were improvements to the outlook and living conditions of Chinese,
Malays and Indians as a result of “the presence of English law and…the
protection of the British flag”.2 While an individual’s views are to an extent
attributable to personal experience, position and perspective, there are wider
themes and ideas relating to the ideologies that structured late 19th- and
early 20th-century colonial society, which are important to consider when
exploring these accounts and the views their authors express.
#### **Source Material**


The Lee Kong Chian Reference Library and the National Archives of
Singapore hold an array of English-language material recounting the
experiences and attitudes of British colonial administrators and their
families during time spent in Singapore, and the Straits Settlements and
British Malaya more widely. The material held in Singapore institutions
takes a variety of forms, from published travellers’ accounts and semiautobiographical
prose produced by members of the island’s European
community, to original and facsimile copies of letters and diaries.
Newspapers and magazines – ranging from broadsheets such as *The Straits
Times* to the satirical *Straits Produce* – record the activities and concerns of Europeans who lived on the island and their relationship to wider regional and international affairs, while official records including census data, the *Civil Service List* and the *Blue Book* further outline the structure and boundaries placed upon the administrative community.3 These texts provide a valuable supplement to existing work on the peopling of the British Empire and the creation of settler communities and identities, much of which focuses on British India, and is interested in governors at the top of the imperial hierarchy, or relies upon official documents held in archives in the United Kingdom.

#### **The Colonial Administration in Singapore c. 1870–1920**

  *It is an article of popular belief that Englishmen are born sailors;<br>    probably it would be more true to say that they are born administrators*.<br> 
  – Frank Swettenham, 19074

British colonial administrators and their families were one small yet significant part of the European population that resided Singapore in the 19th and 20th centuries and were frequently the subject of accounts by residents and visitors. The 1881 census indicates 2,769 European men, women and children as residents in Singapore, of whom 862 were described as “British”. By 1910, the number of British inhabitants had increased to 1,870. However, in a total population of over 228,000, this category still represented less than one percent.

Within this category, an even smaller number made up the “administrative class”, those who were employed as civil servants within government departments. The 1881 Straits Settlement Census gives a figure of 84 Europeans and Americans serving in the civil service in Singapore, out of a total population of 139,208.5

While it remained common for those in the upper ranks of the administration to enter from roles elsewhere in the British Empire, the armyor, less commonly, the home administration, a professional colonial civil service ethos and local identity developed within Malaya in the aftermath of the establishment of the Straits Settlements as a Crown Colony in 1867. Young cadets were recruited through an increasingly formalised system of examination. The nature of this appointment system and the general esprit de corps that permeated the colonial civil service meant that many of the men fit a similar profile, having been raised in the British middle class and educated in British public schools and leading universities.6 

In 1904, the introduction of a colour bar restricted recruitment to the Malayan Civil Service to those of “pure European descent”, although the number of non-whites who had held positions in the civil service or commissioned roles in the police before that date had always been small.7

While women were not appointed to positions within the colonial administration during this period, the white female presence in Singapore grew slowly both as a result of an increasing number of nurses and teachers sent into the imperial sphere, and an acknowledgement that it was acceptable and indeed desirable for wives to accompany their administrator husbands to the Empire.8 Although they continued to be outnumbered considerably by men, there were 1,620 white women recorded in Singapore in the 1911 census, in contrast to 495 European and American women and girls recorded in 1881.9

Although a small population, the nature of imperial power vested these women with significance and the ability to shape society. While valuable work has been done to highlight the voices of other groups in colonial Singapore who have historically been silenced,10 the archival footprint of the men, women and children whose presence in Singapore was tied to the administration of the imperial state allows their lives to be subject to continued analysis.

#### **Imperial Careering**

The concept of “imperial careering” is a useful analytical framework that can be used to explore the time administrators spent in Singapore and how their occupations shaped the way they saw their lives there. It highlights how individuals’ lives and careers were influenced by their movement within and across imperial space, and how these movements formed part of the interwoven networks and stories that invested these spaces and the people who occupied them with specific identities.11

Framing lifestyles with reference to careers is particularly relevant to colonial Singapore due to the belief expressed in contemporary sources that no man should move to the island without a job, both for their own sake and to preserve the prestige of the wider white community.12 For new arrivals, colleagues replaced the networks of friends and family they had left behind in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. The close link between occupation and European presence in Singapore is underscored by the fact that it was rare for administrators to remain in Malaya after their careers had ended, even if they had spent the bulk of their lives there. In 1881, the total number of British residents over the age of 60 in Singapore was no more than 22.13

The *Straits Settlements Civil Service List*, produced annually from the 1880s, presents the names, educational backgrounds and career paths of every individual who joined the administrative service, from newly recruited cadets to the governor. These texts enabled residents and visitors to gain an
understanding of the individuals who made up administrative society and to relate themselves into the hierarchy outlined.14 They can also be used to track the experiences that created individuals’ imperial careers and cross-referenced with other sources, such as newspapers or private correspondence.
