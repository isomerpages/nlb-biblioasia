This documentary examines the tragic life of the mysterious poet Francis P. Ng, who wrote Singapore’s first book-length poem, [F.M.S.R.](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=5334024), and then disappeared during World War II. Researcher Eriko Ogihara-Schuck recounts the almost miraculous way she was able to confirm his fate and to connect with a living relative of his – a niece. Singaporean poets Alvin Pang and Robert Yeo also weigh in on the significance of Francis P. Ng’s work. 

This moving documentary is based on two *BiblioAsia* essays: “[On the Trail of Francis P. Ng](/vol-10/issue-4/jan-march-2015/on-the-trail)” (Jan–Mar 2015) and “[Ties that Bind: The Story of Two Brother Poets](/vol-12/issue-4/jan-mar-2017/ties-that-bind)” (Jan–Mar 2017). The poem “F.M.S.R.” can be found in the book *[Finding Francis: A Poetic Adventure](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=201951092)*.
