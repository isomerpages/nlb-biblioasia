In the mid-19th century, as the French empire began to consolidate its
foothold in Southeast Asia, the Chinese rice trade became the cornerstone
of the colonial economy. On the back of this trade, the port city of Sài Gòn–
Chợ Lớn grew to become a major urban centre and international entrepot,
and by the late 19th century, Indochina was the third-largest global rice
exporter after British Burma and Siam.[^1] At the heart of this trade were
Chinese migrants, whose transnational mercantile networks provided the
financial scaffolding for French colonial capitalism. Christopher Goscha
characterises this thriving trade as a striking manifestation of “East Asian
modernity at work”, and asserts that along with alcohol monopoly and the
development of the colonial plantation system, “the rice trade constitutes one
of the most important components of the Vietnamese economy to this day”.[^2]

Through the lens of the rice trade, this paper examines the confluence of
Chinese migration and diasporic capitalism in transforming Sài Gòn–Chợ
Lớn in the 1870s into a central trade emporium and prominent colonial
port city crucial to the development of French governance in Vietnam and
Southeast Asia at large. My research relies on both primary and secondary
materials in the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library at the National Library
of Singapore, especially the under-explored Singapore historical newspapers
in the NewspaperSG archive, which offers invaluable insights into southern
Vietnam and its Chinese communities. Eclectic information on the rice
trade and Chinese roles in it extracted from colonial Singapore–era
newspapers sheds new light on our understanding of the scope of this trade’s
influence and the close interactions between Franco-British imperial powers
and Chinese communities in the Nanyang diasporic network. Although the
relevant materials and accounts are relatively fragmented, they show the
presence of Chinese commercial activities and the urbanisation of southern
Vietnam at the height of European colonisation in the region, a testament
to the spread of the Chinese population and their importance as politicoeconomic
contributors across Southeast Asian port cities. Hence, these
sources are more than mere supplements to archival sources in Vietnamese
and French.

#### **A Sketch of Sài Gòn–Chợ Lớn’s Chinese Migration and Its Communities**

Chinese migration to Vietnam and participation in its economy are part of
a larger history of Sino-Vietnamese interaction, conflict and state-building
spanning centuries. In southern Vietnam, the first massive wave of Chinese
migrants came at the fall of the Ming dynasty in 1644. Groups of Ming
loyalists escaping persecution by the Manchu-ruled Qing dynasty settled
down in coastal areas of modern-day Vietnam, including Hội An, Qui
Nhơn, Sài Gòn and Hà Tiên. Under the Nguyễn lords’ open attitude towards
the refugees’ integration and their involvement in commercial trade, the
Chinese population in the south grew quickly, with a rough estimate of
30,000–40,000 people in total in southern Vietnam towards the end of the
18th century.[^3] These Chinese and their descendants were collectively referred to by the Sino-Vietnamese term, Minh Hương (明香; ming xiang in Chinese,
or literally “Ming incense”, in reference to their ancestry as Ming refugees).[^4]

The fall of the Ming also saw the Chinese become increasingly intertwined
with imperial politics in southern Vietnam. In 1679, 3,000 Chinese
troops, led by two anti-Qing military generals, Trần Thượng Xuyên and
Dương Ngạn Địch, arrived at the central Vietnamese port of Tourane.
This coincided with Nguyễn Hoàng’s near-complete acquisition of the
southeastern and western Transbassac.[^5] When the two generals pledged
loyalty to the Nguyễn lord and asked for permission to take refuge in
southern Vietnam, they were welcomed with open arms, given the strategic
position of Cochinchina as a key commercial centre in a flourishing
maritime trade network and the Sino-Japanese-Vietnamese alliances from
which the Nguyễn clan drew its power.

In the early 18th century, a Chinese general-in-exile named Mạc Cửu
furthered Nguyễn Hoàng’s imperial ambitions through the conquest of Hà
Tiên, a key southernmost coastal town, at the expense of Cambodia, turning
it into a prosperous and profitable Chinese “colony”.[^6] Thus, well before the
Tây Sơn Uprising in 1771, Ming-loyalist Chinese had established themselves
in Cochinchina as powerful merchants, mariners, court officials and
military leaders who were accorded with political and economic privileges
that outpaced their Vietnamese counterparts. The fact that both sides of
the Tây Sơn rivalries (1771–1802) – Nguyễn Huệ’s forces and the Nguyễn
lord’s armies – relied heavily on Minh Hương attests to their critical role in
Southern imperial politics.[^7] The Minh Hương provided critical resources
and support to recruit soldiers and finance military operations.

While their identities became diluted towards the end of this conflict,
their status and influence as an institutionalised “bureaucratic-mercantile
‘minority elite’” did not cease with the new Nguyễn dynasty at the turn of
the 19th century.[^8] Emperor Gia Long (Nguyễn Ánh) allowed Minh Hương
to be registered as permanent settlers as opposed to itinerant merchants
or sojourners and continued to recognise them as an official minority
within the state. This enabled them to form distinct communities residing
in separate administrative units called Minh Hương Xã or Minh Hương
villages. Members of Minh Hương Xã, classed as ethnic Chinese, enjoyed
reduced taxes and access to official court positions, while being exempted
from mandatory military conscription and forced labour.[^9]

This situation shifted drastically when Gia Long’s son, Emperor Minh
Mạng (r. 1820–41), pursued aggressive policies to assimilate the Chinese into
mainstream Vietnamese society. In 1829, Chinese migrants were banned
from going back to China, and in 1842, they were accorded a different
immigration status from those arriving later – now designated as the
immigrant Chinese (*immigrants chinois*).[^10]

Minh Hương as a category thus began to develop new legal connotations.
Those identified by the imperial court as members of this group now
included anyone of ethnic Chinese descent, including the offspring of
Chinese and Vietnamese intermarriages, i.e. *métisses* or mixed race,
often referred to as Sino-Vietnamese. By joining a Nguyễn-legislated
association of Minh Hương villages, Chinese settlers were encouraged
to interact with local villagers and adopt Vietnamese cultural practices.
For example, Minh Hương children were prohibited from “shaving their
heads and wearing pigtails… and must be registered as a member of the
Minh Hương congregation when they reached eighteen and abandon their
parents’ nationalities”.[^11]

As the Nguyễn polity expanded its territories southward, ongoing
settlements and economic potential in the Mekong Delta presented
numerous opportunities for further Chinese migration. Between 1829 and
1830, just over 1,100 Chinese arrived at the district of Gia Định. From the last

 <div style="background-color: white;">The Pagoda of the Seven Congregations, Chợ Lớn, c. 1900s.<i> National Archives of Singapore (Image no. 19990006456-0038).</i></div>

two months of 1830 to the first four months of 1831, about 1,640 more settled
in the area.[^12]

Under the Nguyễn dynasty, Chinese migration and settlement were
regulated by a system called *bang*, in which the migrants were categorised
into dialect-based communities. Each *bang* nominated its own head officers
to communicate with the Nguyễn court on political and economic issues.
This system of control was perfected under the French when they nominally
ruled over the southern colony of Cochinchina. The French system, called
*congrégation*, required all Chinese to be registered and taxed based on their
place of origin. By 1871, seven native-place associations were recognised by
colonial law: Canton, Fujian, Hakka, Hainan, Chaozhou (Teochew), Fuzhou
and Quanzhou.[^13]

The French sought to benefit from the pre-existing Chinese economic
networks, including their diasporic trade routes and their competitive advantage over indigenous populations in “rice production, fisheries, and
other staple industries”.[^14]The Chinese were also valuable intermediaries
who filled the French coloniser’s manpower needs and provided key sources
of income to thicken the colonial budget. For example, the Chineseoperated
opium revenue farms were the financial mainstay of the colonial
bureaucracy.[^15] But, as Li Tana remarks, “at the heart of Chinese commerce in
Vietnam, the rice trade was the main index of Chinese prosperity”.[^16]Indeed,
with the emergence of Sài Gòn as a cosmopolitan coastal city and Chợ
Lớn as its adjacent Chinatown, the Chinese came to dominate this prized
segment within the colonial economy of Cochinchina.

#### **Chinese Rice Commerce, Colonial Port City, and the Making of a Trans-regional Trade**

Thomas Engelbert aptly describes the city of Chợ Lớn as the rice capital of
colonial Cochinchina; the existing Chinese social and commercial structures
conducive to efficient business-making, and the rapid urbanisation of Sài
Gòn made Chợ Lớn an important centre of commerce in the Mekong Delta
trading emporium.[^17] Two intertwined dimensions account for the rise of Sài
Gòn–Chợ Lớn: French colonialism and Chinese economic networks.

French colonialism changed the face of both the formerly waterlogged city
of Sài Gòn and the little town of Chợ Lớn 6 km away. Before the French
conquest in 1859, Sài Gòn was generally described by local imperial officials
as naturally well endowed, having benefited from the rich resources of
the Mekong Delta and its water-based navigational systems. European
visitors, however, viewed it with much doubt and contempt, seeing it as a
swampy area with sporadic commercial exchanges and a bleak future for infrastructural development.[^18] Decades after French efforts to transform
the region through economic modernisation programmes and public work
projects, however, British observers presented a different opinion, calling
Sài Gòn “the Paris of the East” and “the Pearl of the Orient” as they waxed
lyrical about its exuberant modernity:

   The streets become wider, the houses and shops more resplendent,<br> 
   and further on, as we approach the beautiful cathedral, we come<br> 
   across wide boulevards, and pass beautiful residences of the<br> 
   French inhabitants and fine government buildings… The cost of<br> 
   living in Sài Gòn must be extremely high.[^19]

 <div style="background-color: white;">The Southeast Asian rice network, c. 1910.</div>	 

The city’s bustling commerce was also noted. [^20] Some visitors could not help
but compare it to Singapore – then Sài Gòn’s most important trading partner
but also occasional competitor – and admiringly proclaimed it “a progressive
city” and “the future queen of the East”.[^21] Reporting on the state of
commerce in Sài Gòn–Chợ Lớn with vested interest and wariness, the *Straits
Times* scrupulously cited statistics from its correspondents: “the tonnage
frequenting the port rose from 834,430 tons in 1902 to 1,695,515 tons in 1907”,
and “the volume of trade in imports and exports together shot up from a
value of over 259 million francs in 1902 to nearly 892 million in 1907”.[^22]

Over in Chợ Lớn, the robust Chinese presence and vibrant trading scene
captivated foreign investors. One called it a “veritable Chinese town” in a city
of abundance, where a large number of British traders came in the spring
and winter months to search for rice cargoes, and where “all the large rice
mills – the largest to the east of Singapore” were to be found.[^23]

The so-called modern development of Sài Gòn as a port city began with
intensive hydraulic projects in the 1860s to facilitate colonial control and
access to the more remote parts of the south. A new colonial administration
was put in place to supervise the construction of complex canal networks
connecting the coastal cities to the hinterlands and the waterways of the
Mekong Delta.

According to the Director of the Interior, Paulin Vial, who monitored this
early phase of public works already underway two years prior to the conquest
of Sài Gòn, these projects reshaped the urban geography of the city and
the topography of Cochinchina at large. “Two thousands of workers were
employed from all parts of Cochinchina,” he wrote, “to pull the entire city
out of its muddy state and, most importantly, to stimulate its function as a
port authority with well-operated wharves and smooth-sailing traffic”.[^24]

</div>	 

Specifically for the Cochinchinese rice trade, this period of feverish
construction improved existing waterways, initiated new agricultural zones,
and therefore accommodated rice cultivation by Vietnamese settlers along
these routes. A new canal, Arroyo Chinois (Kênh Tàu Hũ), greatly improved
access to the more distant Transbassac areas. This effectively linked the rural
rice economy of Miền Tây to the rice mills in Chợ Lớn and, via the port of
Sài Gòn, to global rice-export powerhouses such as Hong Kong, Canton,
Singapore, Manila, Bangkok and the Netherlands East Indies.[^25]

This increasing interconnectedness of the international rice markets led
to an exponential growth in exports in Sài Gòn from 1860 to 1919.[^26] Rice,
alongside pepper, became one of the two major export commodities for
the colonial economy. According to the Sài Gòn Chamber of Commerce,
approximately 58,000 tons of rice were exported to Europe and other
global markets from Sài Gòn in 1860, and from 1865 to 1869, rice prices in
Cochinchina achieved the highest index for export.[^27] Only seven years later, this number increased more than threefold to about 193,000 tons. From
the 1880s onwards, Cochinchina exported half a million tons annually,
accounting for 80 percent of the total value of southern Vietnam’s exports.[^28]

The unprecedented boom in commercial rice export was supported by the
activities of various Chinese communities in southern Vietnam around
this time – predominantly traders, rice millers and go-between workers
of all kinds, but also financiers and creditors.[^29] Chinese rice commerce
was organised through an elaborate network of what anthropologist
Clifton Barton characterises as an urban-rural dynamic. It involved the
co-participation of urban rice merchant syndicates (centred on Chợ Lớn)
and village-based Chinese traders, who together forged a link between
Vietnamese rural society and the colonial commercial economy.[^30] In
addition to their significant contribution to the French colonisation of the
Mekong Delta and its agricultural revolution, Chinese merchants were,
in Barton’s words, “the channel through which much of the credit that
financed these development efforts flowed and the source of the merchandise
that provided the incentives for Vietnamese peasants to produce for the
market economy”.[^31]

The Chinese pioneered rice-grinding technologies that gave their mills an
edge in efficiency. In 1876, the first steam-powered mill in Chợ Lớn was
assembled and popularised by a Chinese merchant there.[^32] In 1906 and
1907, two large rice mills in Chợ Lớn – Ban Tek Guan and Ban Hong Guan
– struck a deal with the engineering firm Messrs. Riley, Hargreaves and
Co. to provide extensive electrical installation for their mills, and to supply
“the dynamo as well as the other gear”.[^33] The Singapore-based British firm 

<img src="/images/COA%202020/Chinese%20Rice%20Commerce/Inside_a_rice_mill_in_Ch__L_n_.jpg" style="width:80%;">
 <div style="background-color: white;">Inside a rice mill in Chợ Lớn, c. 1920. <i>L’Association des Amis du Vieux Huế (AAVH).</i>
</div>	
claimed that their electrical engines would be “more than sufficient to run
over 600 lamps of 16 candle power in addition to several arc lamps”.[^34]

By the late 19th century, the Chinese owned the majority of Cochin-chinese
mills. Of the eight rice mills in Sài Gòn–Chợ Lớn, it was believed that five
belonged to Chinese proprietors.[^35] Nationally, until 1911, Vietnam had a total
of 30 rice mills (23 in Sài Gòn and the six southern provinces, 6 in Tonkin,
and 1 in Tourane); of these, 24 (accounting for 80 percent) were Chinese-owned.
In terms of productivity, owing to technological innovations and
sheer numerical advantage over the French, Chinese mills reached an
efficiency level of 500–1,200 tons per day.[^36]

The Chinese compradors in Chợ Lớn also monopolised access to the
coveted young rice grains (*lúa non*) from Vietnamese farmers. Around
December each year, Chợ Lớn’s mills sent out armies of agents to scout the interior of Cochin-china for junks managed by Chinese overseers to
procure paddies. These agents, or “bosses”, served as the most proactive
and persuasive middlemen. Accompanied by local partners, they cultivated
congenial relationships with Vietnamese farmers to buy their crops in the
best condition.

In this way, the Chinese rice merchants of Chợ Lớn built up close
connections with the local farming populations and landlords (*điền chủ*)
and developed in-depth knowledge of the Mekong Delta’s rice-growing
geography. These factors enabled them to purchase grains at preferential
rates by paying the farmers a small deposit (or advance) on an agreed
collecting date with much lower contracted pricing.[^37] Once a harvest
concluded, the farmers had to honour the contract and sell grains to the
merchants before they were transported to rice mills in the city. As this
cycle continued, the intermediary merchants and rice-mill owners made
the most profits. The Vietnamese farmers found themselves hemmed in by
hefty colonial taxes, the loans’ high interest rates, and lack of transparency
in fluctuating market prices. Consequently, they had no choice but to
keep selling their grains to the Chinese and taking Chinese loans to offset
production costs in order to survive till the next harvest.[^38] H. L. Jammes,
in *Souvenir du Pays d’Annam*, painted a vivid picture of the Chinese
countryside agents’ operations:

   The Chinese grain buyer settles, in the four arms of a river<br> 
   on a comfortable boat, slinging a bag of piastres in one hand<br> 
   and a game of *baquan* in the other, patiently waiting for the<br> 
   customers, resting assured that the “fish will bite the bait”.<br> 
   As soon as rice starts to turn yellow, Chinese agents march<br>   through the villages, baiting the farmers by ringing his bags<br> 
   of coins… The Chinese is then ready to offer his advances. If<br> 
   the Annamite is unable to repay loans at maturity, the Chinese<br> 
   will set a selling price for rice much lower than its real value.<br> 
   Credit is, for the Chinese, a powerful means of exploiting the<br> 
   Annamese farmers because they are always short of funds. They<br> 
   have a compulsory expenditure every year: it is the payment of<br> 
   their taxes. Chinese creditors are at their disposal to provide<br> 
   such necessary funds. At the present, the harvest loans granted<br> 
   to the native through provincial chiefs and guaranteed by the<br> 
   government are only authorised to allow them, in the event<br> 
   of a bad harvest, to pay the taxes in arrears. The paperwork<br> 
   hinders farmers who often prefer to deal with Chinese creditors<br> 
   despite the 12% monthly interest rate. This is a minimum rate,<br> 
   recognised by the Annamese law and accepted by the French<br> 
   Courts in Cochinchina. To dissolve of their debts, augmented<br> 
   by these fabulous interests, the unfortunate Annamese peasants<br> 
   must submit their property titles in place of securities that<br> 
   constitute a mortgage in the hands of the creditor. If the<br> 
   Annamese do not pay their debt, the Chinese will seize their<br> 
   harvest at record-low pricing.[^39]

The international shipping of rice, too, was handled predominantly by
Chinese firms. Chinese rice mills in Hong Kong imported primarily Sài
Gòn’s rice and further processed these grains to achieve a more standardised
grading in line with Hong Kong’s importance as a global distributor. As
Hong Kong and Sài Gòn–Chợ Lớn developed an interlinked “rice circuit”,
there was no need for a standardised grading system to be developed in
southern Vietnam, which significantly depressed the price of Sài Gòn’s rice
on the global market and left local rice mills in Vietnam largely performing
the function of mass production. Mass-produced rice meant that grain and
rice-storage quality was often neglected in prevailing commercial approaches
to shipping, which was reflected in the standard practice of “milling on
arrival”.[^40] This inattention to quality, combined with the surprising absence of an established freight insurance industry in colonial Vietnam, shifted the
burdens of taxes and economic losses to the importers rather than milling
parties if unanticipated risks (usually shipwrecks) were to happen. Disregard
for rice quality, and the absence of protection and a grade reference system
were structured around one goal: “exporting as much rice as possible”, as
Li Tana succinctly puts it.[^41] According to Ellen Tsao’s estimates, Chinese
exports accounted for roughly 70 percent of the rice shipping business,
serving the major markets of Hong Kong, Manila and Singapore. This left
European firms a much smaller portion of market share, primarily dealing
with France, the United States, Cuba and Japan.[^42] 

Chinese merchants, therefore, controlled the sources of grains, the
rice mills that made the grains exportable, and the export networks.[^43] 
Pierre Brocheux describes their system as a “pyramid of dependency”,
characterised by the creation of a usurious market dominated by Chinese
and Indian moneylenders. This had come about in part because the
colonial commercialisation of land and expensive infrastructural building
diminished available credit for agricultural initiatives.[^44] The Bank of
Indochina (Banque de l’Indochine) had been created by the colonial state to
issue the colony’s currency and fund various developmental projects. But it
was less interested in extending credit to small farmers, who made up the
majority of the manufacturing workforce, than to the medium and large
landowners, whose profits remained complicatedly attached to Chinese-oned
rice mills in Chợ Lớn and the exploitation of Vietnamese farmers.
The Bank, as Gerard Sasges and Scott Cheshier argue, served a crucial
function that was “to leverage Chinese rather than French capital, diverting
investment from Chinese enterprises and towards French”.[^45]

The urbanisation of colonial Sài Gòn, in which the rice trade played a critical
role, attracted Chinese and Vietnamese migrant labour from the countryside
seeking economic opportunities. The colonial export economy and the
thriving of the Mekong Delta trade reshaped the economic landscape of Sài
Gòn in the early 20th century by initiating demand for jobs in production,
transportation and service industries.[^46] As a result, as the population of the
city grew exponentially, the number of Chinese in Chợ Lớn skyrocketed.
By 1919, there were an estimated 101,427 Chinese in Chợ Lớn (accounting
for about 37.3 percent of the total population of metropolitan Sài Gòn) – an
almost 21 percent increase from 1907.[^47]

Sài Gòn’s rapid transformation into a cosmopolitan hub with coexisting
elements of interethnic interactions and economic modernity engendered
problems of its own. Political dilemmas arose as a result of the Chinese
merchants’ monopoly of the rice trade and junk networks, as Sài Gòn
became the centre of colonial capital development. From the 1870s, the
French radically reformulated their economic ideology and approach
towards colonisation. Their turn to protectionism would collide with the
business interests of the Chinese.

#### **Chinese Domination of the Rice Trade, French Tariffs, and Transnational Networks in the 1880s**

In the early 1870s, the system of Chinese rice commerce began to come
into friction with the imperatives of a French colonial state ravenous for
the enormous profits generated from rice exports and their tax revenues.
This led to a protracted period of commercial rivalry, in which the French
sought to gain authoritative control of the rice trade, whose monopolisation
by the Chinese was deemed to be dangerously unregulated. On their part,
the Chinese leaders – an increasingly powerful conglomeration made up
of cosmopolitan capitalists and *congrégation* leaders – mounted strategic
political opposition.[^48] These transformative encounters, which remained
in the shadow of colonial politics and as a little-known story in Chinese
community history, exposed the ill-conceived nature of French commercial policies and demonstrated Chinese merchants’ critical roles in reorienting
the colonial approach to the transnational rice trade and the legal statuses of
this community.

The rice export boom in Cochin-China drew much attention from French
and British colonists. In 1886, for example, exports rose to a record
3,480,500 tons, as demand from Hong Kong and Manila continued to rise;
a local observer reported that “there are no stocks at Chợ Lớn, grain being
shipped as fast as it arrives”.[^49] But it was chiefly the Chinese merchants who
were profiting from this boom. French observers lamented the successive
bankruptcies of European trading houses in Sài Gòn–Chợ Lớn and their
comparative disadvantages against Chinese-owned counterparts. On 10 June
1876, one such firm owned by German proprietors declared its foreclosure,
citing financial dissolution due to the lack of market price transparency
and Chinese dealers’ “disinclination to lower their prices in transactions”.[^50]  
Repeated complaints from European merchants about their inability to
have a fair competition with Chinese-owned trading houses in Chợ Lớn
preoccupied the Chamber of Commerce’s reports. The French colonial
government thus found itself trapped between seemingly contradictory
imperatives: policing Chinese rice merchants while sustaining the extant rice
networks and continuing to profit from them.

Gerard Sasges, in writing about the early period of French colonial rule,
also highlights this troublesome start, attributing the underperformance of
French enterprises to a combination of “incoherent economic policies” and
“ideological confusion” as well as European merchants’ lack of practical
local knowledge and funding.[^51] The central goal of the colonial state during
this period, he asserts, was to generate revenue for its shrinking budget by
diversifying from existing Chinese monopolies.[^52] Yet, diversification was no
easy feat, if not virtually impossible, for a trade that accounted for more than
60 percent of total colonial exports. And in the words of Virginia Thompson,
rice constituted “the sole product, the only article for both consumption and as a medium of exchange, the condition of the country’s prosperity, the
keystone of Indochina’s economy”.[^53] 

In this entrenched commercial structure, Chinese merchants in Chợ Lớn
and the Mekong Delta had established themselves not only as indispensable
cooperators, business partners and taxpayers who enriched the colonial
economy. They also served to link French Indochina’s regional commerce
to the wider networks of East and Southeast Asian trade. The blossoming
of Chợ Lớn’s rice milling industry turned this Chinese town into a central
node where grains were transported to before being exported. It also enabled
a small group of wealthy Chinese merchants to rise to the top of the social
pyramid, including, for example, the Teochew Quách Đàm (郭琰 Guo
Yan, also known as Kwek Siew Tee) and Vĩnh Sanh Chung, the Peranakan
Hokkien Tjia Mah Yeh (謝媽延), and Jean-Baptiste Hui-Bon-Hoa (黃文華)
and his family. These men and their business empires controlled most of the
lucrative trade activities in Sài Gòn.

As Vương Hồng Sển depicts in his memoir of old Sài Gòn, while these
prominent Chinese merchants engaged in the rice trade, they also branched
out into industries such as real estate, construction and shipbuilding,
extending their commercial influence and leaving their imprint on the urban
landscape.[^54] Quách Đàm financed the construction of the principal market
of Bình Tây with funding channelled largely from the success of his rice
firm, Thông Hiệp, while Hui-Bon-Hoa’s company, Ogliastro, Hui Bon Hoa &amp;
Co., invested in real estate and dominated the moneylending business in the
form of pawnshops.[^55] 

In particular, Quách Đàm, dubbed the “rice king of Cochinchina”, occupied
an almost mythical place in the popular consciousness of Chợ Lớn. His
wealth, political influence and civic contributions were so significant that the
French colonial government awarded him the coveted Legion of Honour.[^56] 
At 14 years old, he had allegedly hidden himself in a steamship cabin,
travelling from a derelict town in Chao’an county in eastern Guangdong across the Nanyang (South China Sea) to Sài Gòn in 1877. There, he took
on all kinds of odd jobs to make ends meet: a coolie boy, junkyard bottle
collector and food hawker. Despite the floating and irregular nature of
these jobs, Quách Đàm saved enough money to make a foray into the rice
business. Taking advantage of the economic opportunities brought about
by French investment in the port of Sài Gòn–Chợ Lớn, he built the first
Chinese-owned rice mills in the region, under the banner of his firm,
Thông Hiệp (Yee Cheong), then located at Quai de Gaudot. According to
some Chinese sources, by the early 20th century, Thông Hiệp managed to
accumulate so much capital that he established four additional rice mills
in Hong Kong, Singapore and Sài Gòn. These mills functioned cohesively
within Quách Đàm’s transnational business network and generated up to
30,000 bales of rice a day, accounting for half of Vietnamese rice exports at
the time.[^57] When he died in 1927, his elaborate funeral was attended by the
city’s Chinese, Annamese and European elite. The cortège of “fifty luxurious
cars” was preceded by a chariot flying a Franco-Chinese flag. Reporting on
the proceedings, French journalist Georges Manue seized the opportunity to
extol the benefits of colonial rule: “this is an example of what a Chinese can
do when he lives under a solid government that guarantees him security and
opportunities.”[^58] Posthumous celebrations of Quách Đàm’s legacy glorified
his active investment in real estate and offshore properties, as well as his
transformation of Chợ Lớn’s metropolitan area.[^59] A journalistic account
indicated that Quách Đàm had shifted the centre of gravity of trade from
Sài Gòn’s Arroyo Chinois to the Bình Tây market area in Chợ Lớn, and
speculated that he had done so to overcome French regulations and to bring
his family-run businesses under centralised control.[^60] 

The success stories of Chinese rice merchants in Cochinchina at the dawn
of the 20th century share a similar narrative arc with those of the Chinese
diaspora in other parts of Southeast Asia, including Bangkok, Singapore
and Penang. For instance, the Wang Lee rice firm was founded by Tan Tsu
Huang, who had arrived in Siam penniless but rose to prominence in the 1900s as the proprietor of two of Bangkok’s largest rice mills, with business
networks stretching eastward to Hong Kong. Tan also operated junk and
steamship services that dominated Siam’s early industry.[^61] In Penang, the
“Big Five” – a Chinese conglomerate made up of the Tan, Yeoh, Lim, Cheah
and Khoo families – accumulated enormous wealth in the 19th century
through various ventures in the Straits Settlements, achieving a high degree
of “regional economic ascendency”.[^62] As Yee Tuan Wong demonstrates, the
Big Five and their associates put Penang’s rice imports largely under their
control by successfully diverting a portion of Burma’s rice, then effectively
monopolised by Indian rice traders, “to the southwestern Siamese states,
North Sumatra, China, and Singapore, at much profit to themselves”.[^63] 

Living up to their reputation as transnational capitalists, Chinese
merchants in Sài Gòn and other port cities operated in what was then
known as a “Chinese rice circuit”. This involved a dynamic range of interport
interactions, which defined the global nature of the rice milling and
exporting businesses. Evidence from the historical newspapers archive at
the National Library of Singapore suggests a close commercial relationship
between Chinese merchants in Sài Gòn–Chợ Lớn and Singapore. Quách
Đàm, for example, opened a branch of his firm Thông Hiệp at 80 Boat Quay,
Singapore, to facilitate rice trading activities there. This information did not
show up until 1923, when his British lawyer, Sir A. De Mello, posted a public
notice in the British colonial press to announce the ownership transfer
of his joint-stock company to a Singaporean Chinese merchant named
Tan Eng Kwok.[^64] 

Faced with this Chinese-dominated political and economic landscape in Sài
Gòn–Chợ Lớn, the French revamped their policing apparatus: they sought to implement a protective tariff on rice exports from Sài Gòn’s port and impose
a heavy poll-tax on “registered” Chinese trading houses. The underlying
motivation for these moves, besides the fear of Chinese domination of
the commercial landscape, came from political pressure from European
firms and lobby groups that wanted to be able to compete with Chinese
businesses and were demanding a share of the profits from the lucrative
Cochin-chinese trade.

The colonists’ urge to impose high tariffs on the rice trade (or private trade
at large) must be contextualised within the broader framework of French
imperial statecraft in the late 19th century. Irene Nørlund describes French
economic policy starting in the 1880s as “one dominated by protectionism”.[^65] 
It entailed a systematic effort on the part of the colonial state not only to
“raise protective tariffs against foreign rice in mother country, but also to
reduce export duties in Cochinchina for rice going to France”.[^66]  With the
passing of a landmark general tariff law in 1892 known as the Méline Tariff,
the French raised their tariffs on rice a total of eight times between 1879
and 1899; such repeated manipulations were meant to direct trade revenues
towards France and to stifle the Chinese monopoly.[^67] 
As long-time participants in the Asian rice trade, the British followed French
protectionist policies closely. Sir Alex Gentle, the secretary of the Singapore
Chamber of Commerce, reported to the colonial secretary of the Settlements
that additional French duties would have a prohibitory effect on Singapore–
Sài Gòn trade, warning that “unless some modification or abatement can be
procured, the flourishing trade between us will be destroyed”.[^68] Commenting
on the newly introduced tariff, a British writer characterised French
protectionism as myopic and impractical:

   The protectionist feeling, so strong in France, shows itself<br> 
   among the French colonists in French Cochinchina by<br> 
   increasing antagonism to Chinese trade rivalry there. […] <br>    The sore point is that Chinese acuteness and business aptitudes<br> 
   have as successfully asserted themselves in Sài Gòn as in<br> 
   other Far Eastern ports, and the French colonists cannot<br> 
   brook alien swiftness thus winning in the commercial race<br> 
   for wealth […] The commercial protection seems to lie in<br> 
   keeping the Chinese in a subordinate position, and in not<br> 
   allowing them to rise beyond certain bounds. Such a policy<br> 
   runs counter to experience in this quarter of the world, where<br> 
   the Chinese are found an indispensable factor in developing<br> 
   backward countries. However, a French experiment, in trying<br> 
   to do without any great Chinese aid in this respect, will prove<br> 
   interesting. Its failure, we fancy, is foredoomed.[^69] 

With the unanimous adoption of the tariff increase in the Chamber of
Commerce, the Chinese merchant community in Chợ Lớn began to feel
the political pressure. On 30 December 1892, the heads of five *congrégations*
– Canton, Fujian, Teochew, Hainan and Hakka – on behalf of Sài Gòn–
Chợ Lớn’s Chinese trading houses, sent a letter to the governor-general of
Cochinchina to voice their grievances. In it, they attacked the promulgation
of the decree of 27 February 1892, which sought to enforce stringent
regulations on Chinese trade by targeting the rice industry through tariffs
and high taxation. The tariff, in their view, was an affront to Chinese
commercial practices, with the potential of ruining the Chinese trade. They
demanded a public hearing and hired a French-speaking legal advocate to
contest the new regulation.[^70] 

Sensing the protectionist tide in the Sài Gòn Chamber of Commerce,
Chinese leaders demanded to be heard by the Chamber leaders and asked for
a decisive repeal of the said decree. They also demanded that the application
of the decree be postponed until the date adopted by the Chinese traders
for the liquidation of their annual operation, to allow trading houses in
China to receive and request necessary information to settle their finances.
On 3 March 1894, merchants of several trading houses delivered another
petition, this time with a bold headline, “we have shown passive obedience by cooperating with French administrators most of the time, but in the
present case concerning our commerce, we will not be silenced”.[^71] Citing
commercial unrest in areas where Chinese capitalists had begun to refuse
“any shipments of money or merchandise” relating to Sài Gòn as a form
of protest, they opposed the additional exit duties on rice export as well
as the forced registration of traders’ identities and declaration of business
records, claiming that “the administration knows by the control, by the
registers and by the patents that we have displayed at home and by the sign
of our doors; to whom it deals and to whom it is to address by the payments
of our taxes”.[^72] Most interestingly, they declared themselves the “victim
of petty crimes” committed by their comrades, who were the “one rotten
apple that spoils the barrels”.[^73] Unlike those small traders, they were major
suppliers of the China trade and respected the rule of law. The Chinese
leaders concluded: “We declare our intention to the greatest representative
of the French in the Far East that businesses will be on a chokehold with the
abrupt implementation of the increase in export duty, which requires further
revision and reconsideration given the Chinese presence in Sài Gòn.”[^74]

Chinese resistance took place not only in Chợ Lớn, but also in Hong Kong,
which became a vigorous commercial battleground between the French
authority and Chinese merchants based in Sài Gòn and Hong Kong. French
members of the Chamber of Commerce were aiming to use the proposed
tariff to also curb Sài Gòn’s Chinese dominance in the Hong Kong trade,
where a rice milling industry was concomitantly developed – a process
inextricably linked to Hong Kong’s escalating demand for Sài Gòn’s rice
and Sài Gòn–Chợ Lớn’s Chinese merchant networks.[^75] This tariff gained
traction in the chamber’s discussion on the grounds that since Chinese merchants enjoyed all the local advantages regardless of labour or freight
costs as opposed to French merchants, the former had to comply with a
comparable surtax so that the playing field could be levelled.[^76]  On 16 March
1894, a representative from the French consulate in Hong Kong dispatched
a message to Cochinchina, informing the governor-general of commercial
stagnation in Hong Kong. The Chinese rice merchants based there refused
to carry any merchandise to Sài Gòn, citing fear of high duties. As one
merchant put it, “We prefer to pay a little more for the freight of rice and
to buy the latter for ballast than to bow before the measure taken by the
authorities of Indochina.”[^77] 

The reactions of Hong Kong’s Chinese rice merchants to the news of French
tariffs were not surprising. The British port city had consistently been the
number one destination for rice exports from Sài Gòn in the last few decades
of the 19th century. In 1876, for example, a record 3,577,500 piculs of rice were
exported to Hong Kong, followed distantly by 979,116 piculs to Surabaya,
444,730 piculs to Singapore, and 204,435 piculs to Batavia.[^78] Additionally,
Hong Kong held a prominent place in the Sài Gòn–Nanyang trade both for
the French colonial government’s strategic commercial expansion and for
the Chinese rice merchants.[^79] On 26 January 1884, the French announced a
subsidy for a new telegraphic line that would connect Sài Gòn with Tonkin
and ultimately Hong Kong. “This new line of Saigon via Tongking to Hong
Kong,” a report emphasised, “will operate independently of all control”,
facilitating the intensifying trading relations in these areas.[^80] 

The Sài Gòn–Hong Kong rice trade had generated immense wealth and
linked many Chinese merchants’ fortunes and privileged status in Hong
Kong to their business operations in Sài Gòn. Chinese rice mills in Chợ
Lớn often functioned as productive branches within a complicated web of
Chinese commercial conglomerates based in Hong Kong and elsewhere.

More importantly, they coexisted and came in direct competition with
European trading houses, and shared a stake within the transnational rice
trade across the Nanyang. Tjia Mah Yeh (Tạ Mã Điền), who founded two
of Chợ Lớn’s most prominent rice mills (the aforementioned Ban Hong
Guan and Ban Tek Guan), took advantage of the Hong Kong connections to
establish a steamship company, The Hock Hai Steamship Co. (福海), in that
port. This enabled him to engage in commercial activities across Hong Kong,
Shanghai, Japan and further south in the Nanyang, including Singapore,
Batavia and the Philippines.[^81] 

Given this intimate commercial connection with Hong Kong and the vast
networks of capital and interpersonal relationships required for the rice
mill business, French attempts to undermine Chinese commercial strength
were not well received by the large merchant communities in Sài Gòn–Chợ
Lớn. In fact, the Chinese protests was so intense and far-reaching that
it bewildered the colonial administrators. M. Aug Boudin, the General
Procurer and the Chief of the Judiciary Service of Indochina, exclaimed that
“out of all the Asian traders in the colony, the Indian representatives had
willingly complied to the decree without any difficulty; it is quite hard to
understand how it is only in Sài Gòn–Chợ Lớn that the resistance occurred
with such ensemble and much energy”.[^82] 

By the late 1890s, rice crops in Cochinchina experienced a short-lived
depression. Exacerbated by continued protests against the French tariff, rice
businesses almost ceased for the entire October in 1892. Chinese and, to a
lesser extent, Indian merchants tirelessly petitioned the French Chamber
of Commerce, arguing that it was not only the insurmountable burden of
taxes that would be detrimental to their businesses but also the “inevitable
fines” as a consequence of mindless formality violation.[^83] In the face of
unceasing opposition from Chinese merchants in Sài Gòn–Chợ Lớn and
those abroad in the port of British Hong Kong, the French Chamber of
Commerce shot down the implementation of the decree at the end of 1899.
Aug Boudin then confessed that this decree and its multiple propositions
had caused overwhelming indignation among the Chinese population in
Chợ Lớn. With a mix of concession and ambiguity, he promised that “a new examination would be made then to propose to the chamber a new text,
which while taking into account the legitimate claims of the Chinese, would
also safeguard the interests of Europeans”. He then concluded that “it seems
to me that this solution would be a preferable one…In any case, until further
notice, I order the prosecutions to suspend any proceedings.”[^84] 

#### **Conclusion**

Sài Gòn–Chợ Lớn was, and has been, undoubtedly a commercial city. Su
Lin Lewis, the author of a comparative history of Penang, Bangkok and
Rangoon, aptly describes these three Southeast Asian port cities as having
“emerged together out of the winds of commerce, following a lineage of
cosmopolitan urban life in Southeast Asia that dates back hundreds of
years”.[^85] They were participants in a long-established premodern trading
emporium that constituted what Anthony Reid has dubbed the Southeast
Asian “Age of Commerce” – the heyday of interregional maritime trade.
Sài Gòn–Chợ Lớn’s development was inextricably linked to commercial
activities within this close-knit network of Southeast Asian port cities, and
its urban histories reflect this fact.[^86] 

At the centre of these historical developments stood Chinese migrant
communities and their commercial networks, which helped transform
southern Vietnam into a stronghold of French economic interests in
Southeast Asia. In addition to providing a foundation for the colonial
extraction of profits, the Chinese rice trade thrust Sài Gòn into the sphere
of global capitalism. It tested the limits of French economic policies, which
relied heavily on revenue generated from a Chinese-dominated trade and
an ideological imperative to make Cochinchina a self-sufficient part of the
empire independent of the metropolitan budget. French protectionism
sought to intercept transnational Chinese rice networks and bring them
under centralised colonial control. But even as it subjected Chinese
merchants to French administrative formalities, modern standards of
transparency and systematic registrations, it ultimately still failed to force the Chinese migrants into becoming, as one colonist put it, “lawful subject[s]
of the colonial state”.[^87]

[^38]: Scholars have elaborated on the Vietnamese farmers’ uninformed decisions to engage in grain sales with Chinese rice dealers as the consequence of Chinese monopoly. During the colonial period, many Chinese brokers concealed market prices, as a widespread practice, only to publicly declare them right before or after a principal market was closed. This left farmers even more vulnerable to the unpredictability of price oscillations. The French colonial government was fully aware of this profit-extracting “malpractice”; on occasion they attempted to crack down on it, by taking advantage of modern telegraphic technology to send pricing information to the chiefs of towns, where it was mandatorily posted in the marketplace. However, many Chinese preempted this move, using their personal connections with these chiefs or the local farmers to convince them to sell grains early. For the most extensive treatment of this point, see the chapter “The Monoculture of Rice” in Pierre Brocheux, [_The Mekong Delta: Ecology, Economy, and Revolution, 1860–1960_](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/redir/itemdetails?bid=13111553), Monograph 12 (Madison: Center for Southeast Asian Studies, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1995), 67.

Coupled with a struggling rice market in the post-1919 Southeast Asian rice crisis, this business decision seemed to be a downsizing initiative to lessen the financial risks for his larger firm in Chợ Lớn.&nbsp;

75 Hong Kong’s demand for Sài Gòn’s rice increased exponentially since the mid-19th century. This was due not only to the forced opening of this port by British free trade imperialism in the aftermath of the Opium Wars, but also to the frequency of rice shortages in Chinese port cities such as Hong Kong and Canton, which culminated in a series of food riots. As a cheaper alternative – owing to the lack of grading and quality control – rice from Sài Gòn became an affordable solution to existing socioeconomic problems in China’s port cities.
