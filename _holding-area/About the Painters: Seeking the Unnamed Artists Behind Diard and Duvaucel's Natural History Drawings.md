#### Natural history drawings might seem clinical and cold, but an unlikely medium pulls back the curtains to find the humanity behind them.

<b>About the Painters</b><br>
It is said that they didn’t have names, <br>
that those names were lost to time. <br>
As if there wasn’t the one who never coloured <br>
the eyes in when he was done, fearing <br>
that the birds would come back to life,<br>
the way a dragon once swam off a scroll <br>
and into some curliqued clouds far away. <br>
Then there was the one who painted <br>
his lizards about to crawl off the edge <br>
of each page, in the manner a lizard tends <br>
to vanish in the space between a wall <br>
and the next, under the watchful eye <br>
of a child who crumbles her crayon <br>
in her fist, or the painter’s, his eyes <br>
barely flitting away from the lizard to <br>
his page, before staring at the wall again. <br>
It was almost as if I was there, myself, <br>
shadowing the one who heeded <br>
the sunbird’s chirp, as he searched <br>
for food and shelter amidst the eaves <br>
of our water jasmine shrub: once, <br>
there was a painter who also noticed, <br>
in a shrub not yet big enough to provide shelter,<br>
the soft yellow down of a bird’s breast, cut <br>
out of sight by the branch on which he perched. <br>
It didn’t matter whether the bird was seen <br>
drinking directly from small white flowers, <br>
if the flowers were in bloom, or if they ever <br>
existed at all, so long as his slender beak <br>
will always have the curve of a polished nail, <br>
always be pointing curiously at something, <br>
	somewhere else.</center></div>
	
In 1818, two French naturalists, Pierre-Médard Diard and Alfred Duvaucel, travelled to Southeast Asia to study the region’s wildlife.[\[1\]](#_ftn1) As part of this process, they collected specimens of species new to them and hired artists locally to produce drawings of these specimens.[\[2\]](#_ftn2) These stunning illustrations have been collected today in _Diard &amp; Duvaucel: French Natural History Drawings of Singapore and Southeast Asia, 1818-1820_.[\[3\]](#_ftn3) While these 117 illustrations provide valuable documentation of some of the region’s fauna at that time, all of them were unsigned.[\[4\]](#_ftn4) Since the names of these artists are not known to be documented anywhere, their identities remain a perennial mystery.

While the subject matter of these drawings was naturally of interest to my research as part of my eco-poetry project, _Where the flowers never stop blooming_, for the National Library Creative Residency, I was more intrigued by the question of who these artists were. Given that these artists had accompanied Diard and Duvaucel on their expeditions, working on the illustrations “when \[the animals\] were either still alive or soon after death”,[\[5\]](#_ftn5) how did their personal encounters with wildlife influence their artistic approaches? In this process essay, I delve into the research behind my poem, “About the Painters”, which responds to the question of the painters’ identities by creatively re-imagining the human-nature encounters behind the illustrations.&nbsp;

A key text that undergirds my approach is art critic John Berger’s essay on aesthetics, “The White Bird”. In this essay, Berger surmises that art is “an attempt to transform the instantaneous into the permanent”.[\[6\]](#_ftn6) Here, the “instantaneous” refers to spontaneous and unexpected encounters with beauty in nature.[\[7\]](#_ftn7) These unpredictable encounters are moments of double affirmation, where “what has been seen is recognised and affirmed, and, at the same time, the seer is affirmed by what he sees”.[\[8\]](#_ftn8) “Aesthetic emotion”, which derives from this moment of double affirmation, is what art attempts to make permanent.[\[9\]](#_ftn9)

Drawing on Berger’s theory, if we consider natural history drawings to be works of art, then they can also be treated as endeavours to make permanent aesthetic emotion. Even if the drawings were originally commissioned for the purposes of scientific study,[\[10\]](#_ftn10) the artists, being personally present on these expeditions,[\[11\]](#_ftn11) would have experienced the spontaneous aesthetic emotions arising from encounters with nature.

Taking a closer look at the natural history drawings in the William Farquhar Collection at the National Museum of Singapore – likewise&nbsp; drawn by Chinese artists whose identities remain unknown – can provide us with insight into how impersonal natural history drawing can reveal private details. As Kwa Chong Guan discusses in “Drawing Nature in the East Indies: Framing Farquhar’s Natural History Drawings”, “personal stylistic differences”, such as the presence or absence of a border around each drawing, or whether rocks in the landscape were more stylized or naturalistic, might “suggest that \[the drawings\] were the work at least two artists”.[\[12\]](#_ftn12)

In addition, certain prominent details, which can be interpreted as the artists’ mistakes or inadequacies,[\[13\]](#_ftn13) take on a different significance once we account for the art training they had received. Take, for instance, the drawing of the Dark-handed Gibbon.  Here, the gibbon’s size is inaccurately depicted – his head is smaller than the ripe mangosteen on the branch from which he hangs.  Yet this infamous “mistake” is also emblematic of a stylistic clash, where Farquhar’s Chinese artists had to reconcile the way they were trained to depict landscapes through axonometric perspectives with their clients’ demands to employ a linear, one-point perspective.

 In a similar vein, the depiction of animals, such as the Greater Mousedeer,[\[1\]](#_ftn1) in landscapes that represented neither the Malay Peninsula nor their natural habitats,[\[2\]](#_ftn2) can be understood in terms of how these artists were trained to depict
