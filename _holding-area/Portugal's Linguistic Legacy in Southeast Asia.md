#### While Portugal may not have had a large presence in this region, remnants of the Portuguese language continue to linger on, in some places more than others.
By João Oliveira

Learning a new language opens your mind to new experiences. Sometimes, though, it can open your mind to old ones as well. I began learning Bahasa Indonesia a few years ago, first on my own, and then later under a teacher. Along the way, I kept encountering Indonesian words that sounded a lot like Portuguese words, mainly because those Portuguese words had entered the Indonesian language.

An Indonesian person wakes up in the morning when the sun comes through the *jendela* (from the Portuguese *janela*, or “window”). He gets out of bed, and after completing his morning routine, he takes his business *kemeja* (*camisa*; “shirt”) out of his *almari* (*armário*; “closet”) and gets changed for work.
