 #### Associate Librarian _Cheng Tee Yin_ traces the life and work of the late Leong Yoon Pin and highlights resources on the composer and educator held by the National Library.

Leong Yoon Pin (b. 5 August 1931 –d. 13 April 2011) was a Singaporean music composer and educator. After his studies at the Teachers’ Training College, he taught music at primary schools. Trained under renowned pianist Noreen Stokes, Leong also went to London, Paris and Newcastle to further his musical studies. In his lifetime, he penned over 100 music compositions including symphonies, concertos, and solo and duet pieces; incorporating Southeast Asian styles was one characteristic of his works. He founded the Metro Philharmonic Society in 1959, and became Head of Music of the National Institute of Education in 1971. His numerous contributions to music composition and education won him many honours: the Cultural Medallion (1982), Bintang Bakti Masyarakat (BBM) (2005), and the COMPASS Lifetime Achievement Award (2007). The National Library Singapore holds a rich collection of resources on Leong Yoon Pin, including scores, recordings and video interviews. These materials reside at NORA (nora. nl.sg), MusicSG (musicsg.pl.sg) and at the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library.
