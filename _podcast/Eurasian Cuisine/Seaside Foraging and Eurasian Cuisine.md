<p>MasterChef Singapore judge Damian D’Silva grew up by the sea&nbsp;and
spent many happy hours foraging&nbsp;for horseshoe crabs, shellfish and
<a href="https://biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg/videos/sea-snail-papaya-curry/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">sea snails</a>&nbsp;that would end up in the cooking pot. In this&nbsp;episode,
he talks about how his childhood and grandfather influenced his cooking
philosophy, when he found his&nbsp;calling in the kitchen&nbsp;(later than
you'd expect), and what's left for him after winning the prestigious culinary
award La Liste.</p>
