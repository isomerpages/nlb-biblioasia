#### Natural history drawings might seem clinical and cold, but an unlikely medium pulls back the curtains to find the humanity behind them.

<b>About the Painters</b><br>
It is said that they didn’t have names, <br>
that those names were lost to time. <br>
As if there wasn’t the one who never coloured <br>
the eyes in when he was done, fearing <br>
that the birds would come back to life,<br>
the way a dragon once swam off a scroll <br>
and into some curliqued clouds far away. <br>
Then there was the one who painted <br>
his lizards about to crawl off the edge <br>
of each page, in the manner a lizard tends <br>
to vanish in the space between a wall <br>
and the next, under the watchful eye <br>
of a child who crumbles her crayon <br>
in her fist, or the painter’s, his eyes <br>
barely flitting away from the lizard to <br>
his page, before staring at the wall again. <br>
It was almost as if I was there, myself, <br>
shadowing the one who heeded <br>
the sunbird’s chirp, as he searched <br>
for food and shelter amidst the eaves <br>
of our water jasmine shrub: once, <br>
there was a painter who also noticed, <br>
in a shrub not yet big enough to provide shelter,<br>
the soft yellow down of a bird’s breast, cut <br>
out of sight by the branch on which he perched. <br>
It didn’t matter whether the bird was seen <br>
drinking directly from small white flowers, <br>
if the flowers were in bloom, or if they ever <br>
existed at all, so long as his slender beak <br>
will always have the curve of a polished nail, <br>
always be pointing curiously at something, <br>
	somewhere else.</center></div>
	
In 1818, two French naturalists, Pierre-Médard Diard and Alfred Duvaucel, travelled to Southeast Asia to study the region’s wildlife.[\[1\]](#_ftn1) As part of this process, they collected specimens of species new to them and hired artists locally to produce drawings of these specimens.[\[2\]](#_ftn2) These stunning illustrations have been collected today in _Diard &amp; Duvaucel: French Natural History Drawings of Singapore and Southeast Asia, 1818-1820_.[\[3\]](#_ftn3) While these 117 illustrations provide valuable documentation of some of the region’s fauna at that time, all of them were unsigned.[\[4\]](#_ftn4) Since the names of these artists are not known to be documented anywhere, their identities remain a perennial mystery.

Although artists employed in such contexts are often referred to as “draftsmen” in various sources, I use the term “artists” to acknowledge their creative involvement in these natural history drawings.
