#### **Hsu’s Nanyang Studies: Under the Shadow of Siamese Historiography**
Before co-founding Chinese-language Southeast Asian (Nanyang or South
Seas) studies in Singapore in 1940, the Suzhou-born historian Hsu Yun-
Tsiao (1905–81) sojourned as a teacher at Zhong Hua School (1933–36) in
the Malay-Muslim region of Patani in southern Thailand.[^1]

Known mostly for his academic and editorial work in South Seas Journal
(*Nanyang xuebao*, 1940–), the popular *South Seas Miscellany* (*Nanyang zazhi,*
1946–48) and the children’s magazine *Malayan Youth* (*Malaiya shaonian*,
1946–48), Hsu also led his students from Nanyang University (or Nantah)
on ethnographic trips; promoted translations from Burmese, Thai and
Vietnamese; annotated a play about Zheng He; wrote classical Chinese
poems; compiled volumes on the anti-Japanese war effort by Nanyang
Chinese (1938–45) and the war crimes trial (1946); as well as produced
Southern Chinese language glossaries and Malay-Chinese dictionaries.
Working across media to promote Malayan identities in the postwar era, Hsu gave 15-minute-long radio lectures on local histories, later compiled
into *Collected Writings on Malaya* (*Malaiya congtan*, 1961).

In contrast, Hsu’s early, pre-Singapore years have been not as well known
in Nanyang historiography. Recently digitised by the National Library,
Singapore (NLB) in May 2018, Hsu’s five unpublished diaries (1930–38)
provide rare glimpses into his interwar Nanyang studies in Siam (now
Thailand), which anticipate the geopolitics and scholarly politics of Nanyang
studies in Singapore some 20 years later.[^2]

In 1933, in his most detailed 400-page diary, Hsu noted his anticipation
in receiving publications from Shanghai: “Jinan University’s Bureau of
Nanyang and American Cultural Affairs (*Nanyang Meizhou wenhua shiye
bu*) sent over a huge bundle of the *Nanyang Newsletter* (*Nanyang qingbao*).[^3]
According to the subscription form it costs one baht, payable to Kaiming
Press. I ordered 30 numbers, from vol. 1 number 1 through vol. 2 number
10”. [*Diaries* v.2: 131]. Other interwar Chinese publications on Southeast
Asia, such as *Nanyang Research* (*Nanyang yanjiu*, 1928– ), were managed by
this bureau through key figures such as Liu Shimu, Li Changfu and Yao
Nan, who would later co-found the South Seas Society (1940– ) with Hsu
in Singapore.[^4] Anxious yet excited by Japan’s state-sponsored study of the
Nanyang (or Nanyo) in the 1920s, these Chinese intellectuals founded the
Jinan Cultural Bureau in 1927.[^5] By producing original work and translating
Japanese and Western writings on Southeast Asia, the Jinan scholars hoped
to redirect intellectual-political energies from Japan, and foster closer ties to
local Chinese newspapers and journals in Penang, Singapore, Malacca and
Batavia (now Jakarta).

Entering the scene slightly later and based in the Nanyang itself, Hsu
transformed the Western- and Japanese-influenced research of Jinan scholars
by drawing on a variety of Thai, Malay and Burmese sources.[^6] Hsu arrived
in Patani just after the 1932 Siamese Revolution by the People’s Party
of Siam, which had partially overthrown the monarchy to introduce a
constitution. Hsu witnessed the chaotic waves of royalist counter-revolution
against Bangkok that culminated in the Bowaradej rebellion of October 1933.  In 1932, the future Prime Minister Phibul Songkhram forced Chinese
assimilation by reviving the Primary School Act of 1921 and the Private
School Act of 1918, requiring Chinese schools, which were then private
schools, to register with the government, effectively placing them under
state control. The Thai language was also made the compulsory medium of
instruction. Hsu joined and negotiated for the Chinese schools’ education
movement (1933–36), which protested against these changes. By 1930, elite
members from Teochew, Hokkien, Cantonese, Hakka and Hainanese
language groups in Siam had agreed to teach in Mandarin and consolidate
a Chinese national identity.[^7] Lamenting his students’ lack of proficiency,
Hsu had at times taught Chinese using English and *zhuyin zimu* (Mandarin
phonetic alphabet) [v.2: 234]. But now, Chinese language class time had
been severely curtailed and other courses had to be taught in Thai. Hsu had
to learn Thai and pass a language examination within one-and-a-half years of
arriving in Siam [v.2: 172–73].[^8]

Purveying the Chinese Nationalist Party’s (Kuomintang) curricula of
overseas Chinese education based on the civilisational mission of *Zhonghua
huiguan* (c. 1900), the “umbrella” organisation for Chinese affairs, Hsu lobbied for Chinese autonomy and cultural upkeep against the new
regime’s forced assimilation policies, which reversed prior arrangements
whereby Chinese subjects had been protected by the Siamese monarch.[^9]
In 1936, Hsu left Zhong Hua School and taught English at Bangkok’s
National School of Science and Engineering.[^10] In 1938, Hsu left for
Singapore after the fascist Phibun, now a Field Marshal, forced Chinese
newspapers and schools – those not already closed by the government or
voluntarily – to shut down nationwide.[^11]

In this section of the essay, I examine the oft-overlooked influence of
modern Siamese historiography on Hsu’s Nanyang studies. In Hsu’s
estimation, the three most important scholars of Nanyang histories were
the French Sinologist Paul Pelliot (1878–1945), Sino-Indian historian
Feng Chengjun (1887–1946) and Prince Damrong Rajanubhab of Siam
(1862–1943).[^12] The latter, though exiled to Penang after the Siamese People’s
Party coup in 1932, had famously inaugurated the study of modern Thai
history (*prawattisat*) by giving a “nationalist reading of the *phongsawadan*”
(dynastic chronicles).[^13] “By 1930, Damrong had retired and was leading the
effort to build the collection at Siam’s National Library by accumulating
ephemeral texts”.[^14] As the “Father of Siam History” [v. 2: 275] and “the royal librarian-in-chief” who played a “crucial role in the establishment of the
Thai territorial state during the late 19th and early 20th centuries”, Damrong
gets Hsu’s stamp of approval:

   *Dafa told me: Thai people call the Head of the Royal Library<br>
   the “Father of Siam History” [บิดาของประวัติศาสตร์สยาม bida<br>
   khong prawatisat siam]; he who happens to be the only historian<br>
   in Thailand.<br><br>
   大发告余，谓暹人称皇家图书馆主任为暹史之父บิดาของประวัติศาสตร์<br>
   สยาม 蓋暹国惟一之历史学家也*。
	 
Lending a twist to Prince Damrong’s royal-nationalist reading of Siam’s
history was playwright and politician Luang Wichit Wathakan (1898–1962)
who wrote popular histories, plays and propaganda in the early 1930s, even
before he became the chief ideologue for Phibun’s military, ethno-nationalist
wartime rule. Luang Wichit’s version of world history borrowed heavily from
Damrong’s traditional-style chronicles of “drum-and-trumpet history” but
updated them to include the heroic deeds of common men and women in
defending the nation.[^15] Drawing on German and Italian Fascism[^16] and their
“militaristic view of the past”, Luang Wichit’s idea of culture (*watthanatham*)
saw Thai subjects as part of a civilised nation (*prathet siwilai*) on equal footing
with Western powers and irrevocably shaped the course of Thai modernity[^17]. 

Luang Wichit’s 12-volume bestseller *Prawattisat Sakon* [*Universal History*,
1929–31] impressed Hsu enough for him to translate its sixth and seventh
books, *Prawat Khong Sayam* [*History of Siam*].[^18] Hsu also published excerpts on the Sino-Thai King Taksin (1734–82) as *Xianluo wang Zheng
Zhao zhuan* (*Biography of the Siamese King Zheng Zhao*, 1936). Zheng
Zhao, the Chinese name of King Taksin (*Daxin*) used by diplomatic
envoys to Qing China, apparently had a Teochew-Chinese father and
a Thai mother.[^19] In his diary, Hsu notes Luang Wichit’s description of
Taksin’s mythic origins: “thunder shook the house” and “a snake curled
up by the baby’s side”, which his father “took as an unlucky sign and
ordered his servant to throw the baby into the river” [v. 2: 96]. Rescued by
a Siamese warrior, Taksin was sent to a Buddhist monastery and mastered
southern Min, Vietnamese and Indian languages.[^20] Taksin went on to
serve as a governor and acquired the noble title Phraya Tak. He famously
expelled the Burmese from the fallen Ayutthaya kingdom (1351–1767)
and founded the Thonburi dynasty (1767–82). Taksin’s achievements,
for Luang Wichit, recalled King Naresuan’s (1555–1605) resistance against
Taungoo Burma’s (1510–1599) repeated siege of Ayutthaya. Taksin would
have been a fit specimen for Luang Wichit’s earlier essay, “On Great Men”
(1928), which included “Napoleon, Bismarck, Disraeli, Gladstone, Okubo
Toshimichi (of the Meiji Restoration) and Mussolini”.[^21]

Luang Wichit’s biography on Taksin venerated Siamese ambition and
success. But Hsu’s selective, annotated translation of this act of hero
worship had a different motive. In 1904, the Chinese reformist Liang
Qichao (1873–1929) published a famous, short essay, “Biographies of
China’s Eight Great Colonial Heroes” (*Zhongguo zhimin bada weiren
zhuan*), which espoused the virtues of settler colonialism and puzzled
over the paradox of a large Chinese diaspora that had no formal overseas
colonies.[^22] Liang named King Taksin as one of the great colonial heroes,
among other southern Chinese traders and bandits who settled as far as
Java and Sumatra. Under the pen name “China’s New Citizen” (*Zhongguo
zhi xinmin*), Liang argued that “Taksin’s accomplishment as a Siamese
king far exceeded the Japanese Yamada Nagamasa’s rule” (1617–30) in Siam’s Nakhon Si Thammarat province, but expressed “sorrow that his
Chinese fellowmen did not know of [Thaksin]”.[^23] For Liang, the Chinese
nation was constituted by the strengths of its diaspora.[^24] Even his call for
a Chinese “poetic revolution” in 1899 was based on his favourable view
of European colonial expansion as a solution for the problems of land
exhaustion and overproduction.[^25] When situated in this tradition, Hsu’s
translation of Luang Wichit’s Taksin reminds its readers, ironically, of
the open secret of a Chinese bloodline of Siamese monarchs – even those
from the later Rattanakosin period (1782–1932) who suppressed Taksin’s
legacy to define their rule – and of the nationalist writer himself, Luang
Wichit (whose given name was Kim Liang); Luang denied his Chinese
heritage all his life. Whether hesitant to engage in anti-imperialist critique,
or performing one based on ethnic injury, Hsu saw an appeal in ethnonationalist
Thai histories that otherwise would affront him – or at least,
the need to unearth a history of peaceful relations between Siam and
China appealed to him. The figure of Taksin becomes a perverse form of
what Benedict Anderson calls nationalism’s “unbound seriality”.[^26]

I further suggest that the popular or “anecdotal histories” (*shihua*) that
Hsu often published in postwar Singapore, with their emphasis on writing
a people’s history, were inspired by Luang Wichit’s examples rather than
by Chinese “literary biographies” in the style of Sima Qian’s *Shiji* [*Records
of the Grand Historian*, c. 94 BC]. Hsu prided himself on rectifying
place-name mistakes in classical Chinese accounts of maritime geography,
for example, “Dani” was actually Pattani, not Borneo; “Dandan” was
Kelantan; “Chitu” was Songkhla.[^27] Hsu’s biographer Lew Bon Hui (Liao
Wenhui) traces Hsu’s textual analyses to the late-Qing scientific mode of “evidential learning” (*kaozheng*) or Han learning (*Hanxue*), which replaced
earlier cosmological readings of classical texts with linguistic scrutiny,
and suggests that this style of historical writing is found in Hsu’s primary
school textbooks on Malayan history.[^28] Others prefer to call Hsu’s method
one of “empiricism” (*shizheng*), based on models of Western social science
that Nanyang historians, such as Liu Shimu, encountered when studying
in Japan.[^29] Hsu remained aloof from revisionist trends in modern Chinese
history such as that of Liang Qichao’s “New Historiography” (*xin shixue*),
which recommended a causal (or evolutionary) approach focused on
“popular movements and social life” attuned to “the world, nations, and
peoples” and its “broader geographical and ethnic framework”, to replace
the “reign-by-reign approach” of “Han China and its dynastic regimes”.[^30]
Hsu hardly commented on the relationship between history and
narrative, nation and ethnicity, but he had an implicit relation to Chinese
scholarship about “frontier history” (*bianjiangshi*) and “China-foreign
communication history (*Zhongwai jiaotongshi*).[^31]

When he introduced his compiled lectures on Malaya, Nanyang, Annam
and *Sejarah Melayu* (*Malay Annals*) at Nanyang University and Ngee Ann
Institution, Hsu said that history writing “required an objective method” –
distortions to fact arose due to external forces rather than questions intrinsic
to history writing: “history was written in a subjective manner because
historians were limited by their environment, and oppressed by institution
and kings” and that “history as a new subject examines the truth of historical
facts – even if it cannot become a science, its methods of study ought to be
scientific”.[^32] For Hsu, the three schools of history were classical, scientific and metaphysical.[^33] Addressing a lay audience, Hsu made it clear that the
task of history writing is the collection and verification of minutiae, and not
their interpretation. It is no wonder that Hsu was more concerned about
dispelling a rumour started by a French missionary in Thonburi – and
seized upon by later rulers – that Taksin went “insane” and was unfit to
govern because of his ascetic Buddhist practices; or as Luang Wichit tells it,
Taksin’s downfall was caused by his two wives.[^34] 

The study of Taksin had already become an industry in China when
Hsu’s translation of Luang Wichit’s text appeared in Shanghai in 1936.
Besides Liang’s influential essay, Yi Benxi’s (pen name *Xinhuang zhengyin*)
“Brief History of Overseas Chinese in the South Seas” (*Nanyang huaqiao
shilüe*, 1910) gave a nationalist view of King Taksin and listed him as
one of 11 accomplished “builders” overseas. In the late 1930s, the next
generation of Taksin scholars such as Chen Yutai and Hsu Yun-Tsiao
clarified the chronology of his reign, and more importantly, published
their essays in the Nanyang, namely in *Zhongyuan bao*’s academic journal
*Zhongyuan Monthly* (*Zhongyuan yuekan*) and its supplement *Taiguo yanjiu*.
Remarkably, the latter publication was founded in September 1939, a
few months after Siam became Thailand, and in the wake of Phibun’s
crackdown on Chinese publications.

Japan’s invasion of China and the pro-Japanese and anti-Chinese sentiments
that dominated in Thailand, compounded by the Kuomintang’s efforts to
enlist overseas support for the war, immensely shaped Chinese research on
Thailand and King Taksin. As I have shown, Hsu’s activism for overseas
Chinese education was beholden to, and indeed scarred by, the post-1910
framework of Chinese racialisation during the reign of King Vajiravudh
Rama VI. Dissatisfied with the annotations in his 1936 translation, Hsu
published the essay “An Unofficial Biography of Taksin” (*Zhengzhao
waizhuan*) two years later. Later essays include “A Study of China-Siam
Historical Relations” (*Zhong Xian tongshi ka*o, 1951), “A Study of Taksin’s
Tribute to the Qing Court” (*Zhengzhao rugong qingting kao*, 1951) and “An
Annotated Translation of a Poem Commemorating Taksin’s Tribute and
Court Appearance in China” (*Zhengzhao gongshi ruchao Zhongguo jixing shi yizhu*, 1940), which was translated from Phraya Maha Nubhab’s account of
Siam’s tribute to China in 1781.[^35]

In 1936, Hsu’s appropriation of Siam’s nationalist histories for Chinese
diasporic purposes predated revisionist writings of Thai history by
historians affectionately known as the “Jek” (chink) school in the 1980s,
once again calling attention to Chinese contributions to the Thai nationstate
– not forgetting the Chinese bloodline of Siamese monarchs. In 1986,
Nidhi Eoseewong published *Thai Politics in the Reign of Thonburi*, which
challenged the “heroic life and tragic death of King Taksin” and has been
since reprinted constantly.[^36] It is worth noting that after the founders of the
Chakri dynasty (c. 1782) staged a palace coup against Taksin and executed
him, Taksin’s legacy has been controversial and open to debate. The figure
of Taksin has gone through waves of rehabilitation under both military
and democratic rule. After the 1932 Siamese revolution, Taksin was used to
“arouse nationalism, which subtly discredited the Chakri dynasty”.

In 1973, however, the People’s Party of 1932 was “presented as a
representation of military rule who robbed the Thai people of a chance
to gain a democratic constitution conferred by the King”. Royalism was
strengthened via the figure of Taksin, where the “monarch’s traditional
function as the epitome of ‘Thainess’ made it compulsory for all groups
jostling for power to display their allegiance to the monarch”.[^37] In a further
twist, as Sittithep Eaksittipong observes, while the figure of King Taksin
helped to “writ[e] the Chinese into Thai history”, its use as a “seditious
cultural symbol” to “subvert the sacredness of the Thai monarch as an abode
of pure Thainess” instead “link[ed] the Chinese to the Thai monarchy”.[^38] This would cause trouble in academic debates about Chinese assimilation
in Siam. Historian Wang Gungwu succinctly describes the controversy
around what is known as the assimilation paradigm: “It was in this
context that G. William Skinner wrote his two authoritative volumes on
the Chinese in Thailand and stressed that the Chinese could, if the right 
policy were followed, be assimilated in Southeast Asia. Today, scholars
tend to emphasise the degrees of political assimilation while pointing to the
continued existence of Chinese ethnicity”.[^39] The paradoxical claim that the
Chinese were never “the Other” but required inclusion into Thai society
would become more perplexing in the “converging intellectual nationalism”
of the Cold War period. From the mid-1970s, progressive Sino-Thai scholars
protested against “American academic involvement with Thailand” by
drawing on the work of nationalistic scholars from the People’s Republic
of China who reasserted China’s claim to “long-term historical sovereignty
over the Dai-inhabited areas of Yunnan”.[^40]


#### **Diasporic Nationalism and Hsu Yun-Tsiao’s Comparative Politics of China and Siam in 1933**

In his diary from 1933, Hsu described the plight of the Chinese minority in
Siam, and more generally, of the *huaqiao* (Chinese sojourners) in Southeast
Asia. Responding, no doubt, to the front page of the newspaper, that space
of simultaneity where, as Benedict Anderson argues,[^41] modern people find
their place in the world, Hsu drew a parallel between the misfortunes of two
minority peoples (the German Jews and Chinese in Siam) confronted with
nationalist exclusivism:

   **May 14 (sun) 83° at night, hot day**<br> <br> 
   *Wu Jingxiong said that the draft of the constitution has already<br> 
   been considered reliable, and is divided into three sections, namely,<br> 
   nationalism, democracy and the people’s livelihood, and will be<br> 
   enacted based on this early draft. The Hitler Youth [youth wing of<br> 
   the Nazi Party in Germany] ransacked all of Germany’s libraries<br> 
   and burned all types of books that differed from their ideology. It<br> 
   attached some kind of sign to the Jews, in order to permit them<br> 
   to be burnt and loathed. Hundreds of Jews have already fled<br> 
   to Palestine. The Siamese government responded to the Chinese<br> 
   schools’ group petition, by rejecting an exemption from its rules. By<br> 
   next month they will strongly enforce the law. All I can do is turn<br> 
   up my palms and lament. I don’t know what to do. (p. 132)*
	 
   **五月十四日（日）夜83°晴热**<br><br>
   吴经熊谓宪法草案已考虑妥当，分民族民权民生三篇，行将起初稿云。德<br>   希特拉 卒青年遍搜全国图书馆，焚去其主义不同之各项书籍，并绘犹太<br>   人像若干，亦焚以鄙视之。有百馀犹太人已避往帕勒士丁云。暹政府答覆<br>   华校请愿团, 拒绝通融，出月便将强迫执行云。扼腕叹息，不知之何?<br>

<img src="/images/COA%202017%20to%202018/Hsu%20Yun%20Tsiao/14_May_1933_1.jpg" style="width:50%;">
 <div style="background-color: white;">14 May 1933 entry in Hsu Yun Tsiao’s diary (v. 2: p. 132; Accession no. B27705372K). <i> Hsu Yun Tsiao collection, National Library, Singapore.</i></div>

It is clear that Hsu felt sympathy for the plight of the German Jews, whose
troubles were just beginning, and anxiety about the status of his own minority
group, the Chinese in Siam, who confronted demands for cultural and
linguistic assimilation in ways that particularly concerned him as an educator.[^42]

Against this backdrop, Hsu invoked Chinese law. The inconclusive debates
over democracy and dictatorship in China during the 1920s resulted in the
failure to implement a liberal constitution.[^43] Finally, in 1933, the Americantrained
lawyer Wu Jingxiong (John Ching Hsiung Wu) drafted the first version
of China’s 1946 constitution, known as the Wu draft. Article 1 of the draft
stated that the Republic of China was a *san-min chu-i* [*sanmin zhuyi*] Republic,
or a republic based on Sun Yat-sen’s Three Principles of the People, namely,
“nationalism, democracy and the people’s livelihood”.[^44] Though promising to
replace the nominal constitution accepted by the Beiyang generals, or warlords,
after their defeat by the Kuomintang army during the Northern Expedition
(1926–28), the Wu draft downplayed two cornerstones of Kuomintang policy
in earlier times – Sun Yat-sen’s emphasis on the international anti-imperialist
struggle and the liberal notion of individual rights. It framed the struggle
for freedom in terms of an essential “Chinese” legacy of national salvation,
whereby the party-state was now legally authorised to crush Leftist dissent from
its leader Chiang Kai-shek’s “revolutionary nativism”.[^45]

Hsu does not discuss such ideological overtones in Wu’s 1933 draft
constitution. What concerns Hsu, as the extract shows, is whether its rule of
law and political interpretation apply to “overseas Chinese” subjects in Siam.
Whereas citizens in China might have been concerned that the 1933 draft
gave the state too much power over them as individuals, it is conceivable
that a diasporic person like Hsu would want to see state power maximised
because only then could China intervene in the affairs of countries where
Chinese sojourners lived. Hsu lamented that China was not doing enough
and worried about the lack of wartime rights advocacy for minority
subjects with no backup from a powerful state (again, a situation where
Jews and Chinese were not precisely in the same plight).[^46] The dilemma
of the Kuomintang government’s right and ability to extend its protection
over “overseas Chinese” populations would be resolved in the succeeding People’s Republic of China premier Zhou Enlai’s 1955 speech at the Afro-
Asian conference in Bandung, where the overseas Chinese were asked to
become citizens of either China or the decolonising nation-state where they
were based.[^47] Today, this subtext is downplayed against the background of
Chinese military expansion into Philippine and Vietnamese coastal areas,
which I will discuss later.

Zhou’s Bandung speech assumed that the citizenship question could be
clearly defined in an emerging world of no longer colonial nation-states,
each defined by their predominant ethnicity. Diasporic populations
would no longer suffer second-class citizenship; their loyalty would no
longer be suspect, but could be unambiguously declared for one nation or
another. However, the history of the Chinese diaspora in the South Seas
is somewhat more complex than an either/or option would allow. For
one thing, powerful figures among the host nations persisted in justifying
discrimination against Chinese sojourners. The best-known expression of
this policy is the essay “The Jews of the Orient” (1914) written by King
Vajiravudh Rama VI (r. 1910–25) under the pen name of Asavabahu.[^48]

The Jewish-Chinese comparison first given broad circulation in that essay
normalised, or at very least, symptomatised the racialisation of the Chinese
as Other in the allegedly ethnic Thai nation. Chinese “racial loyalty”, so
goes Asavabahu’s accusation, made them “undesirable immigrants”, because
they felt entitled to “expect to enjoy all the privileges of citizens without
assuming any of the obligations” such as the corvée labour requirement for
natives, and their expectation involved an “unstable allegiance” to material
benefits such as tax evasion and social services – they “suspended work” to
“protest having to pay THE SAME POLL TAX THAT ALL THAI PAY”
and would ironically deign to register themselves as “nationals of foreign
countries, even within China itself”.[^49]

The 1914 essay thus posed the question of Chinese extraterritorial rights
in Siam, variously described as a semi-colonial, semi-feudal and cryptocolonial
social formation whose monarchs retained independence from
directly exercised Western imperialism but reproduced its governing
structures within.[^50] For another thing, successive Chinese governments (and
opposition parties) often depended on the support of émigré communities,
who by their wealth and standing wielded outsized influence. Many have
since parsed King Vajiravudh’s racist screed as a complex political and
social response to changing times – and therefore not to be taken at face
value. The king was aware of the power of diaspora communities; the fall
of the Manchu dynasty in 1912 and the influence of republican ideology
from China made him fearful of a spillover from a revolution against the
monarchy. Hsu supplies evidence to support this view in *Beidanian shi*
(*History of Patani*, 1946); indeed, the nationalist anti-Qing, or Patriotic
Movement (*aiguo yundong*), had spread as far south as Patani.[^51]

Two other local incidents were probably at the back of the king’s mind:
the three-day strike to protest the increase of the head tax, as mentioned,
and the failed uprising or Palace Revolt of 1912 against him by young
military officers, some of whom were Sino-Thai. To these political motives
may be added an economic one. It is worth noting that, prior to the
surge of Chinese immigration to Siam in 1918, Vajiravudh had described
only the recently arrived poor, rural Chinese as “bad”, and criticised
them for being stubbornly resistant to assimilation, because they refused
to become Thai by failing to adopt his official nationalism of language,
culture and service to the king.[^52] He had “ignor[ed] the Chinese who had
been absorbed into the bureaucracy and old merchant families that had close business and personal ties to the monarchy”.[^53] Thus, the ethnic libel
was perhaps no more than a fig leaf. Given such success in middle- and
upper-class Thai-Chinese assimilation before the 20th century, Wasana
Wongsurawat argues that the “Jewish analogy has acted as a sort of red
herring, distracting observers from better explanations as to why the
roles of China and the ethnic Chinese in the favorable outcome of the
Second World War for Thailand have been so successfully expunged”.[^54]
Instead of state-driven, anti-Chinese discriminatory policies and
propaganda, Wongsurawat views anticommunist international relations
as a more satisfactory reason for the forgotten history of the left-leaning
revolutionary Chinese participation in the Allied-supporting Free Thai
Movement, which opposed the Japanese-Thai alliance and saved Thailand
from being defeated (i.e. from being on the wrong side) in the war. In
hindsight, “Vajiravudh’s railing against the Chinese did not result in a
purge or genocide (as suffered by the Jews in Europe) but led to political
policies that began the process of forcing the Chinese to assimilate into
Thai society”.[^55]

But Hsu could not have possibly anticipated this outcome when he
mentioned King Vajiravudh’s essay in another diary entry. He took antiassimilation
Chinese education policies in Siam as his baseline, using an
erudite instance of late-Qing political relations to disambiguate the Jewish-
Chinese comparison:


   **April 23 (sun) 89° in the afternoon, hot**<br><br>
   *At noon, I went with Da Fa and Ding Yi to the Education<br>
   Bureau to copy out the laws issued by the Minister of Education.<br>
   The important points include: each week classes cannot exceed 28<br>
   hours and 40 minutes, for foreign languages, first to third years can<br>
   have a maximum of 7 hours and 15 minutes, fourth to fifth years a<br>
   maximum of 12 hours and 15 minutes, the remaining hours are for<br>
   Thai language classes. Tentatively we wrote them down, but will<br>
   wait for the official document to make plans. The overseas Chinese<br>    and Jews are comparable. Although the arguments in King Rama<br>
   VI’s essay, “The Jews of the Orient”, were ridiculous, the situations<br>
   are similar. In the past Zhang Zhidong warned Kang Youwei<br>
   and Liang Qichao: “Ah, Kang and Liang, be careful not to make<br>
   China Jewish”. He named the problem correctly but the way out<br>
   isn’t clear. (pp. 119-120)*

Hsu compares older and newer (*dixiong*) cases of the predicament of
an economically dominant minority with no state to back them up
in the context of late-Qing governance. In 1900, Zhang Zhidong, the governor-general of Hunan and Hubei provinces, with the backing of
the Emperor Dowager Cixi, crushed the Hunanese revolt led by Tang
Caichang’s Independence Army (*zili jun*).[^56] Incidentally, the Independence
Army Uprising received the financial support of the *baohuang hui*
(Restoration Party), founded by Kang Youwei and his reform-minded
students such as Liang Qichao after their escape to Tokyo following the
failed Hundred Days’ Reform (*wuxu bianfa*) of 1898.57 In his 23 April 1933
diary entry, Hsu cites the end of Zhang Zhidong’s written proclamation,
“Exhorting the Shanghai Congress and Students Abroad” (*quanjie Shanghai
guohui ji chuyang xuesheng wen*), which blamed the uprising on the Kang
clique and asserted the Qing’s support for overseas Chinese students in
Japan and elsewhere like Southeast Asia.58 It is worth mentioning that only
recently had “huaqiao” become a prestigious group relied upon for domestic
political and financial needs after its denigration during China’s long history
of banning outward migration and private maritime trade.59 When Zhang
admonishes, “Ah, Kang and Liang, be careful not to make China Jewish”,
it is unclear if he was cautioning against making the diaspora dominant
in Chinese affairs, or identifying the Chinese with their diaspora, or even
emptying out China through outward migration. Either way, he suggests
that the Qing was capable of governing an actual nation-state, which the
Jews lacked, and should not suffer the reformists’ campaign as far as Canada,
Hawaii, Japan and the U.S. to portray “China’s plight as a nation too weak
and backward to protect its emigrants from discrimination abroad”.60

Arguing that Kang Youwei’s reformist reading of the *Gongyang
Commentary on the Spring and Autumn Annals* (*Chunqiu*) to address the
Qing political crises was wrong, Zhang Zhidong seems to claim that the present order under the Qing was the only possible one if China was to
avoid breaking up and colonisation.61 Of course, there is some irony in
the fact that an ethnic minority was ruling China at the time and that
much of the resentment against Qing rule was cast as a quasi-democratic
revolt of the Han majority.62 This majority/minority dynamic certainly
complicates the use of the label “Jew”. Zhang’s speech was part of his
harried attempt to re-establish diplomatic relations, via Chinese embassies
in Britain and Japan, with foreign nations of the Eight Nation Alliance,
in the wake of the Qing’s ill-fated support of the anti-foreign, anti-colonial
Boxer Rebellion (1899–1901).63 Thirty years later, for Hsu to frame
the perils of Chinese diaspora in terms of China’s eroded international
standing due to domestic revolts against the Qing and imperial nations,
and specifically, via pro-and anti-Empress Dowager factions in the history
of Chinese political reform, suggests Hsu’s desire for a leadership that still
extended its care for *huaqiao* despite domestic unrest. Hsu lamented the
absence of such leadership during the “Nanjing decade” of Kuomintang
rule (1928–37), when the government was severely weakened by invading
Japanese armies, which bombed his hometown Suzhou during the 1932
Shanghai incident.

#### **The League of Nations and the Mukden Incident**
During China’s War of Resistance against Japan (*Zhongguo kang Ri
zhanzheng*, 1931–45), Hsu was right to be less than optimistic about
the League of Nations’s due process in guaranteeing Chinese national
sovereignty at Geneva. The Japanese seizure of Manchuria (1931–32), or
the Mukden Incident, followed by the invasion of Shanghai (1932) and the
Treaty of Tanggu (1933), where “Chiang was forced to abandon any armed
resistance against the establishment of Japanese-controlled Manchukuo to the north”, were presented by Japanese imperial propaganda as necessary measures to liberate the Manchurians from the oppressive Chinese warlord regimes of Zhang Zuolin (1916–28) and his son Zhang Xueliang (1928–31).64 “Even foreign observers in China mockingly commented on
China’s attempts to appeal to Geneva for help”.65 Hsu’s diary entry on
the Kwantung Army’s capture of Shanhaiguan Pass at the Great Wall
on 3 January 1933, which ended in the inner Mongolian province Rehe’s
annexation to Manchukuo two months later, echoes this sentiment:

   **January 5 (water) sunny, 85° in the afternoon**<br><br>
   *A dispatch arrived: on New Year’s night, the Japanese military<br>
   launched a fierce attack on the Shanhaiguan Pass, shocking North<br>
   China, which was lost today. Some London newspaper criticised<br>
   Zhang Xueliang’s policy of non-resistance and waiting for the<br>
   League of Nations as wishful thinking and self-deception. (p. 11)*

   **一月五日（水）晴，午85°**<br><br>
   电讯传来：日军于元旦夜猛攻山海关，华北震动，今且失守焉。伦敦某<br>
   报批评张学良之不抵抗待国联之迷梦，将成画饼。
	 
International opinion unexpectedly swung in China’s favour. Based on the
1932 Lytton Commission report that recommended “shared sovereignty over
Manchuria”, China’s newly minted Minister to France, Wellington Koo,
presented China’s case at Geneva and successfully argued that Manchukuo
was “an unequivocal violation of China’s national sovereignty”.66 As a result
of Koo’s appeal to multilateral diplomacy and international law to resolve
the crisis, the League of Nations, in a special assembly on 25 February 1933,
voted nearly unanimously not to recognise Manchukuo, with only Siam
abstaining. The Japanese delegation promptly withdrew from the League
of Nations. China had successfully, though nominally, defended against
Japanese aggression, but Hsu saw Siam’s “vote” and increasing collaboration
with Japan as a worrying development for the “overseas Chinese” in Siam.

Indeed, the League of Nations had a dismal record on the issue of minority
rights: in 1928, it upheld “the principle of national sovereignty in response
to petitions about racial discrimination”67; and in 1925, 1930 and 1932,
it “rejected proposals to obligate all members to guarantee the rights of
minorities”. Hsu further connected Geneva’s unsettling failure to resolve
the Mukden Incident with the counter-revolutionary aftershocks of the 1932
Siamese Revolution, which sought to consolidate Siam according to modern
ethnic notions of the nation-state:

   **February 27 (moon) 89° in the afternoon, 83° at night**<br> <br> 
   *A newspaper report: The [Special Assembly of the] League of<br> 
   Nations Report of 19-Nations was resolutely passed, yet Siam<br> 
   abstained from voting, and as a result, the Japanese applauded and<br> 
   rewarded them. In the afternoon, Nantong came to chat, and said<br> 
   that the Siamese king has already retreated to Hua Hin, and the<br> 
   North might be rebelling soon. At first I couldn’t believe it, but then<br> 
   I saw that a Penang newspaper received such a telegram, though the<br> 
   Siamese government denied this. On the one hand, Siam suppresses<br> 
   the overseas Chinese, and on the other hand, ingratiates itself with<br> 
   the Japanese, I really fear this will be my misfortune soon! Nantong<br> 
   said: there are papers to sign in Thai when I get married. Hsu was<br> 
   getting married to Jingmei, but because of the bombing of Suzhou,<br> 
   they could not celebrate.68 (p. 66)*

   **二月二十七日（月）午后89°夜83°**<br> <br> 
   报载：国联十九国报告书__决通过，但暹代表不举手，后日人大加赞<br> 
   赏。午后南通来谈，云暹王已避居华兴，北部或将叛乱。余初不信，<br>

An examination of Hsu’s diaries reveals that his interwar Nanyang
studies can be understood as part of a transnational scholarly effort to comprehend the rapidly evolving global framework of human rights
(especially minority rights of the “diasporic”), the implementation of
constitutional law in Siam and China, and multilateral diplomacy’s
guarantee of national sovereignty – emerging norms of law and custom
that met with varying degrees of success during the rise of fascist
militarism in the 1930s.

In Hsu’s 27 February 1933 diary entry, the news of King Prajadhipok
Rama VII’s retreat to Hua Hin and that “the North might be rebelling
soon” were mediated via a telegram sent to a Penang newspaper in the
Straits Settlements. The exceptional feature of Hsu’s 1933 diary – the
longest of the five volumes at 400 pages, written in classical Chinese
and sometimes illegible handwriting – is its vast expression of “lifewriting”
by an aspiring historian who also wrote literature (e.g. classicalstyle
poems), interpreted historical events through the lens of literary
history, and pioneered the genre of Nanyang “anecdotal histories”
(*shihua*), which he later popularised through brief radio lectures and
extracurricular “textbooks” on Nanyang histories in postwar Singapore.69
To overcome the belatedness or perceived deficiency of his “diasporic
time”, Hsu mixes historical and anachronistic registers to make sense of
his transient residence in Pattani in 1933, and in doing so, updates the
Chinese tradition of diary keeping.70

 <div style="background-color: white;">16 May 1933 entry in Hsu Yun-Tsiao’s diary (v. 2: p. 133, Accession no.: B27705372K).<i> Hsu Yun Tsiao collection, National Library, Singapore.</i></div>

Pan-Asianism, according to Okakura Tenshin and others later inspired
by Russia’s defeat by Japan (1905) such as Sun Yat-sen and Bengali
poet Rabindranath Tagore, proposed a united Asia to fight European
imperialism. Incidentally, Hsu’s first publication, a chapbook of poems,
*Fu Yun* (*Floating Clouds*) was written in imitation of Zheng Zhenduo’s 1922 translation of Tagore’s *Stray Birds* (*Feiniao ji*, 1916).71 In 1933, Hsu
was presciently skeptical of Japan’s leadership of a Greater Asia. Given a
“new lease on life”, this form of pan-Asianism would soon become Japan’s
rationale for military aggression for a Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity
Sphere. So when the nationalist leader Mohammad Hatta – later Indonesia’s
first vice-president under Sukarno following Japan’s surrender in 1945 –
wooed Japan’s support for Dutch East Indies independence, Hsu does not
say much about this dubious partnership. Instead, he focused on what for
him represented a clear case of anti-imperial consciousness: a challenge to
China’s sovereignty in the South China Sea by French Indochina in the
Paracel Islands dispute.

As in the Manchukuo incident, then as now, China based its claims over
island chains such as the Paracels (*Xisha* or western sands) and Spratlys
(*Nansha* or southern sands) on historic right.72 Even before the Sino-French
war (1884–85), when the Qing conceded Annam and Tonkin (Vietnam) to
the French, who then consolidated their presence in the region, the Paracels
had a long, complex diplomatic history of expedition and settlement that
involved Chinese fishermen and cartographers, British merchants, German
missionaries and French custom officials and scientists. Japanese economic
interests, or “indulgence” according to Hsu’s citation of a Soviet newspaper,
took the form of ocean phosphate mining by Mitsui Bussan Kaisha since
the 1920s. French occupation of this so-called *terra nullius* was gradual at
first. Its government formally claimed and annexed the Paracels to Annam
in 1932, and the Spratlys to Cochinchina in 1933, which set off modern
sovereignty claims by Japan, Vietnam, China, as well as Malaysia, Taiwan,
and the Philippines, which continue to this day.73

Hsu followed the Paracels dispute closely in his 1933 diary, and published an
essay, “The Disgraceful History of Pattle (*Shanhu*) Island”, in the biweekly
Suzhou-based magazine, *Shanhu* (1932–34), co-founded by Fan Yanqiao after the Mukden Incident.74 In an earlier issue, Hsu had published “The
Myth of San Bao Gong (Zheng He) in Southeast Asia”, a topic on which he
expanded.75 These two early examples of Hsu’s Nanyang studies responded to
the threat to China’s maritime sovereignty. But during this bitter commotion,
Hsu made room for more positive news. For instance, he notes Siam’s
prize-winning display of modernity at the World’s Grain Conference and
Exhibition in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada (24 July–5 August 1933); a twist
concerning textbooks in the saga of Chinese school activism; the constant
stream of fundraising activities besides his teaching duties; his role as a jack-ofall-
trades for the Chinese community in literary matters (though he did not
always think highly of his workmanship); the cost of clothes alteration at the
southern tip of the Malay peninsula; as well as including, as usual, a snippet of
news that showed the perils of strongman politics and brinkmanship:

   **August 5 (earth) scorching hot, 86° at night**<br><br>
   *A newspaper report: Siam recently participated in Canada’s<br>
   Agricultural Exhibition and Competition and won 11 out of the<br>
   20 prizes, as well as the the top two or three prizes for its rice.<br>
   I heard that the top prize was won by the display by Bangkok’s<br>
   nearby government experimental factory. Siam already formally<br>
   announced that it would cancel its ban on Chinese schools using<br>
   the textbooks based on the Three People’s Principles (sanmin).76<br>
   Only Chinese language hours will be limited. It’s like the Monkey<br>

The layers of politics and erudition in Hsu’s diary evoke “a thick
transregionalism, a spatially expansive yet integrative account of a mobile
society”.77 Hsu’s diary urgently shapes and consolidates his public response
to the evolving relationship between Siam and China, and interwar
modernity. In the next section, I will consider how the genre of the diary
allows older ideas of diasporic nationalism to converge with Hsu’s “minorpeninsular”
poetics of discovering Malay-Muslim Patani through textual
histories and of observing the Bowaradej (royalist) rebellion from afar.

#### **Hsu’s Minor-Peninsular Patani: Literature, Politics and Religion**
Prince Damrong’s histories, which Hsu admired, said that Patani “belonged
to the Thai [kingdom] since time immemorial [… which] presumably
refers to the Sukhothai kingdom, the first recognised “Thai” kingdom”.78
But Patani was an autonomous territory before it was colonised by
Bangkok: “the 1909 Anglo-Siamese treaty marked the formal transfer of
authority to Bangkok in return for the abandoning of Siamese claims to
Kedah, Kelantan, and the Malay states further south”.79 In the 1930s, the
encroachment of the Thai imperial project, which combined Theravada
Buddhism with “European forms of institutional and legal modernity”
affected Siam’s large Chinese minority but left Jawi-speaking Malay-
Muslims in its southern provinces of Pattani, Yala and Narathiwat relatively
untouched.80 Islamic law on polygamy and inheritance, for example,
was administered as private law so that Malay-Muslims could become
Thai subjects and citizens. A few years later they became the targets for
assimilation in cultural, linguistic, education and legal terms.

In a move to decolonise historical methods and write local, autonomous
histories from new angles, such as examining port-city connections, while
acknowledging the importance of Chinese sources, new scholarship also
addresses the recent spate of ethnoreligious violence in the region. Anthony
Reid has described the Thai South and Malay North as a “plural peninsula”,
whose “polycultural” nature meant that differences ought to be explained
by “specific historical dynamics rather than superficial ethnic distinctions”.81
Since the 16th century, the cosmopolitan Patani has been “the kind of base
for the Chinese Southeast Asian trade that Bangkok, Batavia and Singapore
later became, with its ships sailing throughout the Archipelago as far as Makassar, and to Ayuthaya and Hoi An”.82 In fact, the “importance of
Patani for the Chinese trade in the early 17th century made the Kedah-
Patani portage also attractive as a journey of about 10 days”.83 Sojourning
a few centuries later, the Suzhou-born historian Hsu was sensitive to this
as he taught in Patani and witnessed Siam’s tumultuous constitutional
struggle and ethnonationalist shaping of the nation. As Hsu reconstructed
Patani’s cultural pluralism through Thai, Burmese, Malay and Chinese
sources, he filtered it through the lens of diasporic nationalism, that is, his
homeland’s civilisational mission of overseas Chinese education and wartime
mobilisation effort against the Japanese. Patani indigeneity, as such, emerges
through Hsu’s obsessive archival work of textual histories rather than an
observation of present-day local customs.84

This counter-temporal layer of politics and erudition in Hsu’s diary is
“plural”, but not in Reid’s sense. I choose the term “minor-peninsular” to
evoke Hsu’s Patani, whose “thick transregionalism, a spatially expansive yet
integrative account of a mobile society”, functions according to diasporic
scales and agencies.85 Hence, Hsu’s tracing of Chinese migrant knowledge
and sojourner activism understands local Patani histories in a triangulated
way. In his short story “The Young Navigator” (1946), Hsu reconstructs
the trauma of Chinese diaspora in the Asia-Pacific war through the eyes of
a small boy who flees by boat from Selat (Singapore) through Songkhla,
Kuantan, Kelantan and Terengganu, hiding at their “peninsular ports”
that escaped the reach of empires.86 Hsu even used Hokkien phrases such
as* jiu baxing*, a reference to an important river transport hub in Fuzhou,
China whose complex system involved pricing goods for foreign customers
at 98 percent. Fusing the “heroic figures” of Robinson Crusoe and the famous Ming admiral and Muslim eunuch Zheng He’s voyages with
Malay *merantau* (wandering) culture, Hsu’s survivor’s tale has a naïve,
ethnographic realism that grounds the adventurous child’s perseverance
in the militarised war economy. Hsu wrote another story about Japaneseoccupied
Singapore, narrated through the eyes of a baby chicken.87

Indeed, Hsu’s creative work relied heavily on his research on maritime
circulations. After leaving Siam in 1938, Hsu continued his Thai studies in
Singapore. He published the short story “Dufu” (Ferryman) by Thai female
social realist writer K. Surangkhanang (given name Kanha Kiangsiri, 1911–
99), translated into Mandarin by Ye Yi, in the journal he edited, *Nanyang
Miscellany* (*Nanyang zazhi*, 1948).88 Volume 1:4 (1946) contained short
essays about Patani and Thai customs, as well as a travel account of Malaya
and Thailand (“Ma Xian jixing”), making it easy to conclude that Hsu
saw southern Thailand as continuous with the Malay peninsula. In a short
paragraph titled “The Historical Status of Patani” from his anecdotal history
“The Development of States on the East Coast”, Hsu notes:

   *“Dani” or “Danian” is short for Patani [in Chinese sources].<br> 
   Though not included in Malaya’s histories, Patani had a<br> 
   very close relationship with the Malayan states, and is also on<br> 
   the Malay peninsula. Patani was the most powerful Malay<br> 
   kingdom after the Malacca Sultanate fell, and, before Singapore<br> 
   flourished, the state was most prosperous during the reign of the<br> 
   Patani queens between 1588 and 1627, when overseas Chinese and<br> 
   Anglo-Dutch traders would go there to conduct business. At this<br> 
   time, Johor’s state presence was far less than Patani’s. The reign<br> 
   of the queens was methodical. They had a close relationship with<br> 
   Johor and Pahang, but also used military strength [to fight off<br> 
Siamese invasions].*89

Defined neither by capital flows between Shanghai, Hong Kong and
Singapore, nor the mainland writer’s exotic desire for the tropics during
exile, Hsu’s Nanyang imagination lay in its historical geography and sea
routes used by traders and “pirates”, and occasionally, the orphan child.
Focused on the high seas, Hsu’s history-writing inverts what Wang Gungwu
calls an “earthbound continental” mindset, or the neo-Confucian ideology
of agrarian dedication, that dominates imperial histories, oriented along
a North-central axis, and the genealogies of southern elite families alike.90
In his diary, Hsu fixates on the story of the Teochew pirate (*wokou*) Lin
Daoqian, who attacked the coasts of Fujian and Guangdong when private
trade with foreign merchants was outlawed during the Ming, and escaped
to Kaohsiung, Champa, Luzon, and finally, Patani (c. 1566). There Lin
settled with his 2,000 Cantonese followers, rose to prominence, obtained
a fief by serving the sultan and marrying his daughter and, according to a
local legend, built the Krue Se (Gresik) Mosque and died a Muslim. The
bronze cannon he had cast had blasted him: “one cannon would not go off,
so Lin went to fix it and it hurled him into the ocean... The other cannon is
still stored in the Bangkok palace” [v. 2: 158–59] and is “named พระยาตานี
[*phraya tan*i]” [v. 2: 207].

Buried next to Lin at the mosque is Lim Ko Niao (Lim Guniang), or his
alleged sister, who pursued him from China and “committed suicide by
hanging herself from a tree after protesting in vain” against her brother’s
conversion. As Reid notes, “[t]his lady’s cult was already known locally in
the late 19th century, but in the nationalist 20th century, she (the upholder
of pure ‘Chinese’ tradition), rather than the *peranakan* Lin Daoqian (the
founder of local Chinese identity and fortune), became a hero for the
Chinese of Singapore and Malaysia”. Hsu describes in detail in his diary a
festivity at Lim Ko Niao’s shrine in Pattani, and thus gives a hint of why it
appeals to today’s “cross-border religious tourism” and its view that southern
Thailand is “a substitute Chinese homeland”.91

In October 1933, Hsu finished his essay, “A Study of Lin Daoqian’s Brief
Time in Patani”, and had it published in *Dongfang zazhi* in January 1935 (Vol. 32) [v. 2: 282].92 He was proud to correct the mistake in Chinese
annals that mixed up Brunei (*boni*) with Pattani (*dani*). In his later *History
of Patani*, Hsu examined Patani’s port-city connections to southern China,
Japan, as well as Portuguese traders during the age of commerce (1450–
1680). He also included an appendix of biographies about nine Chinese
traders or “pirates” who ended up in Patani, such as the aforementioned Lin
Daoqian and Wang Dayuan.93 A counterpoint to the magisterial histories of
Zheng He’s expeditions, Hsu’s biographies of swashbuckling seafarers recall
Liang Qichao’s eight settler colonialists, but also pioneered the local history
of Chinese in Patani.

#### **Hsu’s Account of the Bowaradej (Royalist) Rebellion in October 1933**
It seems perplexing that Hsu draws on textual histories and world reports
on Jewish diaspora, rather than materials relating to the Patani Malay-
Muslims in front of him, to establish his diasporic subjectivity and response
to the erosion of Chinese rights in Siam. From his diaries, it seems that
international news stimulated his reflections on Nanyang affairs. A history
that is merely local does not have consequences; a history that resembles
other histories gains importance. Hsu’s elision of Patani’s modern populace
indicates that he was mainly concerned with Chinese minority populations,
and not with minority populations as such. As Sharon Carstens notes, Hsu’s
foreword to the first issue of *Journal of the South Seas* (1940) “laid out the
goals of the publication, chief among which was a desire to utilise Chinese
culture and scholarship to increase respect for the overseas Chinese, who
were too often characterised as the ‘Jews of the Orient’”.94 Hsu’s minorpeninsular
Patani emerges most vividly in his detailed accounts of the
Bowaradej (royalist) rebellion of October 1933. After the unsuccessful coup
d’état of 20 June 1933, Prince Bowaradej (1877–1947), financed by King Prajadhipok, who had retreated to Hua Hin and later Songkhla [v. 2: 66,
268, 277], led a revolt against Khana Ratsadon’s constitutional regime,
following the Siamese Revolution of 1932. Hsu records with alarm that
“rebels” had occupied the Don Muang airport on 12 October, and the
transport lines that were cut by the resulting chaos: 

   **October 18 (water) sunny and hot, 83° at night**<br><br>
   *The chaos in Siam affected traffic. The mail coach from the Malay<br>
   Federation can only reach Prachin Buri province, which should<br>
   now be under occupation by the rebel troops. Apparently, the troops<br>
   at the Don Muang rebel base number 5,000 to 10,000, and are<br>
   engaged in extremely violent battle with the capital. The telegram<br>
   lines have been cut, the situation is serious, the government’s<br>
   declaration to subdue the rebel groups within two days is not<br>
   tenable. Today I translated The History of Pattani Province, and<br>
omitted half of it*. [p. 269]

   **十月十八日（水）晴热夜83°**<br><br>
   暹罗变乱，影响交通，马来联邦邮车祗能通至巴真武里，应该处已为叛<br>
   军所占据。据云叛军根据地在Don Muang 为数自五千至一万，其在京畿<br>
   开火者，颇为猛烈云。电线均已隔断，形势严重，政府之宣言能克服之<br>
于二日内者，不可持矣。今日译大泥府志，去其半矣。

Observing the chaos from afar, Hsu engaged in his translation of Pattani
and Songkhla histories; completed his essay on Lin Daoqian; wrote about a
power struggle in the principal ranks of a newly formed Bangkok Chinese
high school; and gave an anecdotal history of the origins of Deepavali (the
Hindu festival of lights). In this heady mix of contexts, Hsu’s sympathy for
Patani sovereignty appears for the first time; the Bowaradej revolt, for Hsu,
also led to the consolidation of southern Thailand under Siamese rule:

   *Other parts of Thailand were mostly conservative, should the<br>
   rebel army reach them, they will not be independent (from the<br>
   monarchy). In Patani, which is in the South, there are Siamese<br>
   who became officials to consolidate the mostly Malay region under<br>
   the new regime. In Songkhla, … the Siamese army stationed and<br>
   set up camp at the English- and European-owned mines. Also, Sing<br>
   Sian (newspaper?) jointly pronounced that the rebel army has been<br>
vanquished, and King Rama VI fled by plane. Who to believe?*<br><br>
   其他各地大多保守觉，一旦被叛军勾通，不难独立也。至南方大年则<br>
   有暹罗人为长官，统揽政权，惟人口多巫族。宋卡，布吉，多邪 (?) 等<br>
   地，暹军驻扎处，均英澳人投资矿产所也。又据星暹统称，叛军已溃<br>，
   亲王乘机出奔。不知信否。
	 
	
#### **Conclusion: The Significance of Hsu’s Diaries to Nanyang Historiography**
Seen less charitably, Hsu’s interwar Nanyang studies was a partisan
reflection of the Chinese war mobilisation effort. Just as “disciplined
diary writing” was introduced “as late as the ‘Nanjing decade’ of GMD
[Kuomintang] rule” to shape soldiers’ commitment to acts of violence,
Hsu’s diary helped him, as a historian, be accountable to the Chinese
nationalist cause and hence not to be considered a “collaborationist” or
“Chinese traitor” (*hanjian*). Writing the self mobilised his convictions and
transformed his consciousness to act in his own ways while being far away
from his hometown of Suzhou, China. Hsu’s personal diary recalls the
prized genre of loyalist resistance and moral self-reflection by late-Ming
literati opposing the traumatic Qing transition.95 Perhaps after the 1930s the
reason for diary-writing faded. After Hsu moved to Singapore in 1938, his
collaboration with “southbound intellectuals” (*nanlai wenren*) to research
and publish works through the South Seas Society was interrupted by the
Japanese Occupation of Singapore (1942–45), which forced him into hiding.
Diary keeping, if discovered, could have meant death; even his *History
of Patani* (1946) manuscript, completed in 1940, had to be stashed in the
ceiling board, and was thankfully only half-eaten by silverfish. Instead of
private life-writing, Hsu found similar genres such as children’s literature,
anecdotal histories and testimonies, which he wrote and edited, to satisfy his
interest in postwar reconstruction via public scholarship.

Hsu’s diaries are valuable because they fill the gap in our understanding of
his early years, and they bring together contexts that have been overlooked
in Nanyang historiography. That historiography views the China-Singapore
connection, via its publication and institutional histories, as an important genealogy. My biographical method instead asks what was politically and
personally at stake in Hsu’s interwar Nanyang studies. Hsu’s responses to
current affairs, especially of China and the Nanyang, from the perspectives
of Siam and its southern region of Patani, suggest that the relationships
of *huaqiao* to China and their places of residence are in constant
transformation.

As a newly arrived China-loyalist in Siam, Hsu intervened in communities
that had perhaps been assimilated through generations of residence, and
perhaps more strongly affectively linked to networks of Teochew people,
for instance, than to a distant state headquartered in Nanjing. The complex
histories of Chinese diaspora continue to be worked out in Hsu’s postwar
Singapore, where scholarship written in Chinese or from communist
China was seen as politically suspect. Hsu’s diaries recorded events as they
unfolded from a viewpoint whose ultimate destiny is unknowable. But they
also anticipated the trauma of total war, and Hsu’s decision, as a survivor, to
double down on his efforts to fight for the longevity of Chinese education
and Nanyang studies in post-1945 Singapore. Hence Hsu’s personal diaries
are important because they anticipate the geopolitics and scholarly politics
of the South Seas Society some 20 years later.

Naturally, the postwar history of Nanyang archives and scholarly societies
would be more familiar to readers. Based mainly at the aforementioned
Nanyang University (1956–80), the first Chinese-language university
in Southeast Asia, Nanyang Studies crystallised a scholarly generation’s
interests in the region they called “home”.96 Notably, Nanyang University
(or Nantah) graduates majoring in history and geography fondly recall
their ethnographic trip to India, which Hsu led in 1959. Hsu wrote a parttravel
memoir, part-cultural-religious history titled *Travels to India* (1964),
and published it as one of 12 books in the Afro-Asian book series (*Ya Fei
congshu*) he edited for Singapore’s Youth Bookstore (*Qingnian shuju*, 1955– ),
which was founded by Chen Mong Chea (Chen Mengzhe, 1920–2016).97
Incidentally, the publication of this series was related to the opening of
Nanyang University. The books were used as textbooks, so they sold well and underwent a second print run.98 This was around the time that Chief
Minister Lim Yew Hock’s government banned the import of all publications
from China (1958), and local publishers cornered the Malayan market in
Chinese-language publishing.99 Other well-known book series include the
*Singaporean and Malayan Literature and Art* book series (*Xin Ma wenyi
congshu*) and *Literature from the South* (*Nanfang wencong*), which launched
the careers of many local writers, such as Han Suyin, Ly Singko (Li Xingke),
Miao Xiu, Lin Cantian, Wei Yun, Lian Shisheng, Qiu Xuxu and Zhao
Rong.
 
Folk historians (*minjian xueren*) wistfully narrate the rise and decline of
Nanyang Studies in Singapore (1940–81), and view Hsu’s passing in 1981 as
marking the end of an era. After 1981, Nanyang Studies took a turn toward
ethnic Chinese studies.100 This calls for an explanation. Nanyang University
(1956–80), the first Chinese-language university in Southeast Asia, was
forcibly closed around that time, to meet the Singapore government’s
globalising efforts in English. The centre of gravity for overseas Chinese
studies shifted to departments of Chinese studies at the University of Malaya
and National University of Singapore. No studies pursued in Chinese
thereafter could escape questions of ethnic identity. The shift from diasporic
to local Malayan identities in postwar Nanyang publications, perhaps,
creates a paradoxical, uneasy feeling where scholars celebrate creolisation but
wonder if it is attached to the heavy cost of assimilation.101 Hsu’s creolised,
anti-assimilationist stance in Nanyang studies is worth revisiting. Fledging
and open to varied intellectual trends and genealogies, his interwar Nanyang
studies imagined a different outcome, and it is important that we do not
take its evanescence as a foregone conclusion.
