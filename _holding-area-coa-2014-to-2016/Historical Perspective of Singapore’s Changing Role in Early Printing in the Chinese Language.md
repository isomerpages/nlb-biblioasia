#### **Introduction**
From its founding in 1819, modern Singapore has been a multiracial and
multilingual society. The earliest materials printed in Singapore were in
languages such as English, Siamese, Malay, Arabic and Chinese. This
study focuses on early printing in the Chinese language, Singapore’s role
in this development and the impact it made on the Chinese language and
Chinese communities.

This essay starts with a survey of what was published during the 19th
century, followed by a review of what has been studied so far. Based on
these, I examine the changing role of Singapore as a society that enabled
early printing in the Chinese language to take shape, and how this early
availability of printing in the Chinese language impacted the multiracial
and multicultural society.


#### **What Was Published: Output From Early Printing in the Chinese Language**
Due to historical and environmental factors, Singapore’s early efforts
in Chinese-language printing were not well preserved. Despite the
introduction of *The Book Registration Ordinance*, 1886, the situation did not improve, as observed by Cecil Byrd in 1970 when he visited Singapore.
He conducted a survey of early printing in the Straits Settlements, which
was a preliminary exploration of the nascent print industries in the
three settlements.1 Since then, a lot of effort – by local and international
academics, librarians and curators – has been put into compiling a set
of documentation. They have worked to source for samples, including
unrecorded extant titles, so that we now have a better picture of the total
output of such prints.

This study will attempt to compile a list of known titles held by libraries
and archives, listed in special bibliographies and catalogues, as well as
cited by researchers in their dissertations, theses, papers and articles. The
listing will also be supplemented by searching the Online Public Access
Catalogues (OPA C) of the National Library Board (NL B), National
University of Singapore Libraries (NUS Libraries), British Library (BL)
and other libraries specialising in East and Southeast Asian studies.
The resultant listings have been appended as: *Appendix I: A chronology of
printing in the Chinese language, 1825–1902; and Appendix II: A chronology
of printing in romanised Malay and English produced by Straits Chinese,
1889–1902*.

A total of 143 uniform titles were identified as samples of early printing in
the Chinese language, as well as those in romanised Malay and English
produced by the Straits Chinese during the period from 1825 to 1902. The
inclusion of the latter category of printing is due to the fact that they were
works translated from Chinese classics, or written by Chinese and printed or
published by the Chinese press. Together, these constitute the documentary
heritage of the Chinese community in Singapore.

#### **What Has Been Studied: Literature Review**
Studies of early printing efforts in Singapore in the Chinese language
started with Chinese newspapers that emerged only in the second half of
the 19th century. As early as 1927, China-based journalist Ge Gongzhen (戈公振) mentioned in his three-volume work *History of Chinese Newspaper
Press* (《中国报学史》) that the significance of publications such as Malacca’s
first Chinese periodical, *Chinese Monthly Magazine* (《察世俗每月统记传》), and
Singapore’s first Chinese-language magazine, *East-West Magazine* (《东西洋考每
月统记传》), was their contributions to the development of the modern Chinese
press in China.2

Ge also made a special trip to London to read the two magazines and
subsequently wrote an article about them.3 His initial attempt to chronicle
Chinese-language printing may have prompted the first academic study
of early Chinese newspapers by Singaporean Chen Mong Hock. Her MA
thesis, *The Early Chinese Newspapers of Singapore*, 1881–1912 (Singapore:
University of Malayan Press, 1967), remains one of the most authoritative
studies on this subject to this day. Following Chen, a few local and foreign
academics, including He Shumin (何舒敏, 1977),4 David Chng (莊钦永, 1982),5
Wong Hong Ting (王慷鼎, 1982),6 Wu Qing Tang (吴庆棠, 1997),7 and Zhuo
Nan Sheng (卓南生, 1998),8 also added new findings to these studies.

During the first half of the 19th century, the printing and publishing scene
in Singapore was very active. Soon after Sir Stamford Raffles had founded Singapore and established it as a modern and free entrepôt centre linking
Southeast Asia to the rest of the world, Protestant missionaries from the
London Missionary Society (LMS ) and American Board of Commissioners
Foreign Mission (ABCFM) made Singapore a printing centre for both
religious tracts and secular material during the same period. A significant
number of Chinese-language prints that made a great impact in the region,
as well as in China, were produced during this period.

However, as LMS and ABCFM were not based in Singapore, their archives
and library collections were not easily accessible for consultation, and the
study of the missionary press and their printing and publishing activities
during this period inevitably became difficult to achieve.

As such, it is unsurprising that the study of the missionary press and its
printing activities was not feasible until 1960, when ABCFM donated their
library materials to Harvard University, and their archives to the Houghton
Rare Book Library in the U.S.9 Since then, John King Fairbank, Susan
Barnett and the Harvard University group have embarked on a series of
studies into the Protestant missionaries’ legacy concerning the spread of
Christianity and their role in China’s modernisation.10 Cross-cultural
communications by the western Protestants and their Chinese respondents
subsequently became the main subject of study.

In 1985, the Harvard group published an inaugural selection of papers
from a conference held at Harvard University in August 1978. The volume,
entitled *Christianity in China: Early Protestant Missionary Writings*, explored
what the Protestant pioneers of the 19th century wrote in Chinese for their
target audiences.11

Following the precedence of ABCFM, LMS donated their archives and
collections to the School of Oriental &amp; African Studies Library at the University of London in 1973.12 Studies, such as the one on the Anglo-
Chinese College of Malacca by Brian Harrison (1979),13 the London
Missionary Society by Leona O’Sullivan (1984),14 and *The Printing Presses of
the London Missionary Society Among the Chinese* by Ching Su (1996), as well
as a series of books on LMS and early printing in Malacca, Singapore and in
China were made possible by this donation.15

In China, studies on early printing in the Chinese language focused
mostly on the missionary-driven Chinese press, the two early Chinese
magazines (Malacca’s first Chinese periodical *Chinese Monthly Magazine*
and Singapore’s first Chinese-language magazine *East-West Magazine*)
and cross-cultural communication between East and West. These studies
were conducted by two important groups: one at Zhejiang University, led
by Huang Shijian (黄时鉴), and another at Fudan University, led by Zhou
Zhen He (周振鹤) and Zou Zhen Huan (邹振环).16 They published a series of
reprints of primary sources, research articles and monographs featuring the
topics mentioned earlier.

In 2006, David Chng completed his PhD dissertation and presented a
comprehensive study on Chinese printing and publishing by LMS and
ABCFM in the first half of the 19th century in Malacca and Singapore.
His work was inspired by the pioneer Protestants who had been stationed
in Southeast Asia and China in the years before the First Opium War
(1839–1842). The coverage of topics such as the political conflict between
the Qing and British governments that led the two missionary societies
to set up Chinese printing presses in the Malayan peninsula, as well
as the workings of both presses (financial sources, printing processes,
number of titles published, print runs, etc.) gave context to the origins of
the publications.

Chng’s thesis also examined the distribution network of publications,
with an in-depth analysis of the impact these publications had on the
Chinese scholars who read them. His thesis also examined the linguistic
contributions of the missionaries to the modern Chinese lexicon, and the
significance of these publications in the history of thought in modern
China. As such, Chng’s work covers almost all the important findings by
earlier researchers in this field (as of 2006) and provides more concrete
source evidence to prove his points.

Besides his dissertation, Chng also published a series of papers on
missionary novels in the Chinese language,17 a relatively new discipline of
study (started by Patrick Hanan (2000)18 of Harvard University) in relation
to early Protestant missionary writing.

Chen Song-Chuan, formerly an assistant professor of history at Nanyang
Technological University, Singapore, recently produced a study exploring
the efforts and impact of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge
in China (SDK , 1834–1839), the publisher for the majority of secular material
printed by the American Mission Press based in Singapore in the five years
before the First Opium War.

In summary, there has been a lot of focus on early printing in the Chinese
language in Singapore in the first half of the 19th century, but works
published in the second half of the century, besides Chinese newspapers,
have, for the most part, been neglected. Studies have been largely limited
to Protestant missionary works before the First Opium War, and none
paid sufficient attention to the role of Singapore in this publication legacy.
Moreover, many of their studies do not include printing activities after the
decline of missionary presses in Singapore.

While Ching and Chng’s dissertations both acknowledge the role of
Singapore in the early printings by the Protestants before the First Opium
War, the scopes of their studies do not go beyond that of the Protestants’
works – Chen focused his attention on the “information war” waged by the
SDK based in Guangzhou, and did not take Singapore’s supporting role in the “war” into serious consideration. Hence, there is a need to go beyond
existing research and examine the changing role of Singapore as a place of
Chinese publications during the entire 19th century.


#### **Singapore as a Centre of Printing and Publishing of Chinese Materials Outside China (1825–1846)**

Failing to establish a missionary enterprise among the Chinese in
Guangdong, Robert Morrison (1782–1834) of the LMS turned his attention
to Southeast Asia while waiting for an opportune time to return to a more
open and welcoming China. Between 1815 and 1819, LMS established
missions in Malacca, Penang, Batavia and Singapore.19 In 1815, William
Milne founded the Malaccan mission and started printing *Chinese Monthly Magazine*, the first Chinese magazine published outside of China, which
had a great impact on the emergence of modern Chinese magazines in
mainland China.20

Between 1819 and 1822, LMS shifted part of its printing resources to
Singapore.21 On 23 January 1823 Claudius Henry Thomsen set up a printing
press to print English and Malay documents, as well as bind books. Samuel
Milton, also from LMS , made an unauthorised acquisition trip to Calcutta,
India on 8 December 1822 and returned with three printing presses that
enabled the Mission Press to print in five languages: English, Siamese,
Malay, Arabic and Chinese.22

The Press operated from the Singapore Institute for a few years with Milton
in charge, followed by Thomsen. Publications produced between 1825
and 1826 were published under Institution Press or Mission Press. In 1825,
the Press began to print religious tracts in the Chinese language. From
then on, Singapore overtook Malacca as LMS ’ printing and publishing
centre in Southeast Asia. Blocks for the reprint of Milne and Walter
Henry Medhurst’s religious tracts in Chinese were engraved and printed in Singapore. The Press also published the first Chinese textbook, *Xunnu
Sanzijing* (《训女三字经》), in 1832.23

The ABCFM also undertook a special task to start the mass printing
of a Chinese publication for the SDK , which was established by some
foreign merchants and Protestant pioneers based in Guangzhou.24

From 1815 to 1845, the Singapore mission presses (LMS and ABCFM)
produced a total of 102 Chinese titles comprising religious pamphlets, as
well as secular materials written in Chinese by Protestant missionaries and
their assistants.25 Most of the publications were first printed, or reprinted,
in Singapore. About half a million volumes were estimated to have been
printed in Singapore,26 significantly more than those printed in Malacca,
Batavia, Penang and Serampore.

As a printing and publishing centre, LMS and ABCFM also developed a
distribution network in Singapore. While in Malacca, Milne had established
a distribution network through ships’ captains, as well as masters of junks
and boats, with books reportedly reaching America, St. Helena, Bombay,
Madras, Bengal, Burma, Tibet, China, Irkutsk, Japan, Cochin China, Siam,
Kedah, Penang, the islands in the Malacca Straits, Bencoolen, Padang,
Bangka, Borneo, the Moluccas, the Celebes, Java and Manila.27

Milne’s successor followed the same modus operandi, but increasingly
turned to ship captains and crew in Singapore. In addition, thousands of
copies of the New Testament and religious tracts were distributed by Karl Gützlaff, Medhurst and Jacob Tomlin on their travels,28 and by all willing
callers at the missions. American missionaries followed the same distribution
pattern as the English, but with one innovation – they chartered a ship for
wider literature dissemination rather than passively depending on ships
visiting the harbour.29

#### **Singapore’s Supporting Role in the “Information War” on China (1834–1834)**
One of the outcomes of early Singapore imprints in the Chinese language
reaching the Chinese in mainland China and Southeast Asia was the
introduction of modern science and technology to the Chinese-speaking
world. As early as 1833, when Gützlaff established the *East-West Magazine*
in Guangzhou, his intention was to fill the Chinese magazine with “useful
knowledge and science”. A year later he advocated the establishment of
SDK and placed the Chinese magazine under its auspices. The magazine
was subsequently printed in Singapore, as were the other titles published
by the Society.30 Gützlaff defined scientific knowledge broadly to include
history, geography and economics, subjects he frequently covered.31

Active in the five years before the First Opium War, SDK represented a
third form of British engagement with the Chinese, besides the diplomatic
attempts of 1793 and 1816, and the First Opium War. The SDK waged
an “information war” to penetrate the information barrier that the Qing
government had established to contain European trade and missions.32

In the early 1830s, foreign missionaries and merchants in Guangzhou
believed that restrictions placed on Westerners were due to inadequate and
insufficient knowledge of the West. Thus, they convened in November
1834 and decided to engage in “warfare” that involved the publication of
books in Chinese.33 Through the publication and distribution of these
books, they hoped to give the Chinese access to information barred by the
Qing government and believed this would enable them to understand the
true character of the Europeans and be open to trade and proselytising.34

Between 1834 and 1840, SDK reprinted or published one magazine and six
Chinese books in Singapore, including *East-West Magazine* (1834–1839);
A History of England (《大英国统志》 by Gützlaff, 1834); *A General History of
the World* (《古今万国纲鉴》 by Gützlaff, 1838); *A Short Account of the United
Provinces of America* (《美理哥合省国志略》 by E.J. Bridgman, 1838); *Aesop’s
Fables* (《意拾秘传》 by Robert Thom, 1838–1839), *Outline of Old Testament
History* (《古时如氐亚国历代列传》 by Robert Morrison, 1838) and *A Treatise
on Political Economy* (《贸易通志》 by Gützflaff, 1840). The treatises on
history and geography were prioritised and hence were among the earliest
books published.35

The impact of SDK ’s publications was felt during the First Opium War
in mainland China. After the British defeated the Qing Empire, scholars
such as Wei Yuan (魏源, 1794–1856), Xu Jiyu (徐继畬, 1795–1873) and Liang
Tingnan (梁廷枬, 1796–1861) witnessed, or became concerned with, the
power of the maritime nations of the West and stepped up efforts to
understand these foreigners. When these scholar-officials sought to gather
materials to write treatises on the new maritime nations, the Singapore
imprints were able to meet this need.36

Wei Yuan’s work, *Illustrated Treatise on Maritime Countries* (《海国图志》),
was first published in 1842 in 50 *juan* (chapters); revised and expanded
editions were published in 60 *juan* in 1847 and 100 juan in 1852, with more
materials in Chinese. Researchers have pointed out that *Illustrated Treatise on Maritime Countries* resembles an organised scrapbook with materials
from different books (with minor changes) cut-and-pasted into it, sorted by
continents and sub-categorised by nations.

Information related to the Society and the geo-history of the maritime
countries that was “borrowed” from the Singapore imprints include 12 from
the *East-West Magazine*,37 14 from *General Account of Trade* (《贸易通志》)38
and 42 from Bridgman’s *A Short Account of the United Provinces of America*.39
*The Illustrated Treatise on Maritime Countries*, in turn, became one of the
most important reference books on the subject of global geo-history in
the second half of the 19th century. In China, the scholar-officials of the
Qing Empire used this resource when they were forced to learn more about
the new world power struggles between the maritime empires. In Japan,
*Illustrated Treatise on Maritime Countries* was widely circulated and made an
impact on the Japanese reform era.40

Xu Jiyu’s *A Brief Description of the Ocean Circuit* (《瀛寰志略》), published in
1848, along with *Illustrated Treatise on Maritime Countries*, influenced both
Qing China and Japan. To write the book, Xu studied materials collected in
Chinese and interviewed foreigners on the subjects of global geography and
world history.41

Liang Tingnan’s *Accounts on the United States* (《合省国说》, 1844) and
Accounts of London (《兰伦偶说》, 1845) also relied heavily on *A Short Account
of the United Provinces of America* and *East-West Magazine* respectively.42
Until at least the 1880s, these Chinese publications printed or published
in Singapore were the main resources for understanding the maritime
nations in the Qing Empire.43

#### **Singapore’s Linguistic Contribution to Modern Chinese Lexicology (1807–1843)**
In order to express certain Western ideas in their translated works, pioneer
missionaries had to coin new words that were later adopted by Chinese
scholars. These new words were the tools that allowed intellectuals to tap
into western knowledge and widen their perspective of the world.44 As a
substantial number of these new words were formed between 1807 and
1843, and were first used in publications published in Singapore, Singapore
therefore had a role in contributing to modern Chinese lexicology.

Pioneer missionaries generally employed two approaches in coming up with
new Chinese words or phrases. Firstly, they adopted an existing classical
Chinese term and gave it a new meaning, extended its original meaning
to add dimensions of meaning to it, or Christianised the original term.
Secondly, if they could not transform an old word or phrase, they would
then create new ones.45

During the 36 years of proselytisation through writing and translation
work, the pioneer missionaries created a great number of new Chinese
terms, which covered a wide range of subjects (such as religion, science and
technology, social science, culture, political science, history and geography)
that became rich cultural resources. Some terms were later replaced by
newer ones while many are still widely used today. The following terms are
some examples from the Singapore imprints and showcase their contribution
in the development of modern Chinese lexicology:46

#### **Singapore as Conducive for Multilingual Presses and Cultural Communications (1877–1902)**
After the end of the First Opium War in 1842, China opened up five more
ports in addition to Guangzhou for foreign trade and proselytisation. The
Protestant missionary presses moved their bases away from Singapore,
leaving behind an infant printing industry that continued to grow with the
settlement. The American and British missionaries moved to China in 1843
and 1846 respectively.

The presence of missionary presses encouraged the growth of the multilingual
printing and publishing industry in the colony, aided by growing prosperity
and a burgeoning population. Right from the beginning, Singapore was a
multi-ethnic society comprising Malays, Chinese, Indians, Europeans and
others. After 1825, the missionary presses were able to print religious tracts in
five languages – English, Siamese, Malay, Arabic and Chinese – with printing
equipment from Europe and domestic and Chinese manpower.

Benjamin Peach Keasberry (1811–1875), LMS ’ last agent in Singapore, ran
the presses that were left behind as the Mission Press at Commercial Square.
He printed letterheads for merchants, bills of lading and other commercial
paper, in addition to printing religious publications, books, journals and
half a dozen Singapore newspapers that appeared briefly before 1859.47
Among them were the earliest Chinese newspapers in Singapore, such as *Local News* (地方日报, 1845) and *Rising Sun* (日升报, 1858), which may have
encouraged the birth of *Lat Pau* (叻报), the longest-running Chinese daily,
in the later part of the century.

Around 1861, Lim Kong Chuan (林光铨，字衡南), a Chinese immigrant from
Jinmen, soon saw an opportunity in the printing business and learnt the
technique of western printing from a European press,48 possibly the Mission
Press. While Lim may have established the first Chinese commercial
printing company Koh Yew Hean Press (古友轩) in early 1870s,49 the first two
Chinese-language publications were not published until 1877. These were *A
Genealogy of the Lim Clan* (《西河林氏族谱》) and a Malay-language learning
text *A Book to Learn the Barbaric Language* (《通夷新语》). A Genealogy of
the Lim Clan was funded by donations and distributed free-of-charge to
donors and clan members,50 while the latter was a commercial title that
sold well. Lim reprinted the Malay-language learning book in 1883 and
subsequently changed its title to *A Chinese-Malay Dictionary* (《华夷通语》).
This publication was a best-seller and was reprinted in 1888 and 1900.

By this time, new Chinese immigrants to the colony, as well as residents,
had increased significantly and there was a demand for learning the Malay
language. Lim Tsai Tak (林采达), a Chinese physician who arrived from
Batavia, published *A Bridge to Understanding the Malay Language* (《通语
津梁》) in 1889, which was also widely distributed. This new edition of the
author’s earlier dictionary *Kitap Tong Gi Tjin Liong* was first published in
Batavia. The Singapore edition was published by Jiwenzhai Press (集文斋印务
馆) that was founded in 1889. Lim was a co-partner of the newly established
press.

Beside printing and publishing Chinese materials, Chinese commercial
presses in the second half of the 19th century also printed books and
articles in English and Malay. The Koh Yew Hean Press, for example, was
commissioned by the Straits Branch of The Royal Asiatic Society in 1880
to print *Hikayat Abdullah*, the well-known autobiography of Malay literati
Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir Munshi (1797–1840) in Jawi script. It was also one of the printers of the *Straits Chinese Magazine*, a Peranakan magazine
founded by Straits Chinese Lim Boon Keng and Song Ong Siang in 1897.

The Lat Pau Press, established in 1881, also engaged in multilingual
publishing and printing activities in the 19th century. Titles printed or
published included *A General Index to the Proceedings of the Legislative Council
of the Straits Settlements from April 1867 to December 1882* by Benj. B.J. and
Rozells (1884), *Picturesque and Busy Singapore* by T.J. Keaughram (1887),
Yuenan Youji (《越南游记》) by Tan Keong Sum (陈恭三, 1888), *The Straits
Eurasian Advocate* by Henry Arnold Chopard (1888),* Cherita dahulu kala
dari pasal Hong Keow sama Lee Tan*, *Turon-kan dari buku “Hwan Tong”,
Di jaman Tong Teow sama Chew Teow, Vol 3–8* by Chan Kim Boon
(Batu Gantong, 1891–2), and the *Heiat-al-heia-wan* by Wan Abdullah bin
Umar (1896).51

The Chinese presses also printed or published a great number of Baba
literature, written by Straits-born Chinese or translated by them from
Chinese classical works. (See Appendix II for a list of works.)

The existence of multilingual presses in the later part of the 19th century
could be due to the volume print services they had to undertake to ensure
their survival, but in a way it fostered inter-ethnic communications between
races in a multiracial society.

#### **Singapore as a Platform to Champion Confucianism and Chinese Nationalism (1881–1901)**

The emergence of Chinese daily newspapers in the last two decades of
the 19th century contributed to the formation of a community identity.
In 19th-century Singapore, the newspapers of the different communities
carried news and social commentaries that would have been of interest to
their readers. Hence, they were very parochial, featuring news about the
community and events in their homelands for the most part.52 For this
reason, despite its Straits Chinese origin,53 *Lat Pau* was very China-centric, perhaps because its editor, Ye Ji Yun (叶季允), was a native of Anhui who had
been invited to Singapore to serve as the editor for the paper, or possibly
because its founder’s, See Ewee Lay, father had belatedly discovered his
Chinese roots.54

Ye edited the paper for 40 years and Lat Pau was a powerful force
in promoting Confucian values in the Chinese community. Chen
Mong Hock described *Lat Pau* as a “public institution” of the Chinese
community, “nonpartisan” in stand and “patriotic” in nature.55 Besides
championing local Chinese opinions and views in Singapore, *Lat Pau* also
assumed the role of public educator. This was more pronounced in the
newspaper’s earlier days.56

The *Xing Pao* (《星报》, 1890–9), owned by Lin Hengnan and published by
his Koh Yew Hean Press since January 1890, was just as conservative as
*Lat Pau*. Its editors were more outspoken with regard to Confucian values.
For example, in an editorial on 13 March 1894, the editor observed that
many of the local-born Chinese no longer understood and observed the
traditional five relationships57 laid down by Confucius, and considered it
the duty of the press to bring the local-born Chinese back to the ancient
ways of China.

Besides *Lat Pau* and *Xing Pao*, two other Chinese dailies emerged after the
Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895). They were *Thien Nan Shin Pao* (《天南新报》,
1899–1901) founded by Khoo Seok Wan and *Jit Shin Pau* (《日新报》, 1898–
1905) founded by Lim Boon Keng.

These four Chinese dailies emerged during the last 20 years of the
19th century when Confucianism and Chinese nationalism were the
norms among the Chinese in Southeast Asia. The three most prominent
journalists of the time, Ye Ji Yun, Lim Boon Keng and Khoo Seok Wan,
were themselves Confucian scholars and enthusiastic nationalists, and were actively engaged in a Confucian revival movement.58 Therefore, it
was unsurprising that the dailies had these themes in common. Singapore,
under the British colonial government during that same period, flourished
under a relatively permissive environment towards printing in the Chinese
language. As such, Singapore had, in a way, provided a free platform for
Confucianism and Chinese nationalism to emerge and grow in this multi-ethnic
society.

#### **Singapore as a Nursery for Nanyang Literature**
During the 19th century, the term “Nanyang” referred to the “South Sea”
region and was most commonly used by the Chinese to refer to today’s
Southeast Asia.59 The term “Nanyang Literature” therefore refers to Chinese
Literature from the Nanyang region. This term was used by Yeap Chong
Leng in his book *Huang Tsun-Hsien* and *Nanyang Literature* (《黄宗宪与南洋
文学》, Singapore: Singapore Society of Asian Studies, 2002). Yeap did not
define the term, but explained that Huang Tsun-hsien, the first Chinese
Consul General in Singapore from November 1891 to November 1894,
conducted monthly region-wide competitions in couplet and essay writing
on topics pertaining to Nanyang such as current affairs, culture, traditions
and customs.

These activities were mostly conducted through two literary clubs in
Singapore, namely the *Tu-Nan she* (图南社) and *Hui-Yin she* (会贤社). The
essay competitions attracted hundreds of participants every month from
all over the region, with the most number of participants from Singapore,
Malacca and Penang. The winning couplets and essays were first published
in *Lat Pau* and *Xing Po*, and reproduced in books by leading Chinese writers
in Guangdong and Shanghai. Huang served as both patron and chief judge
of *Xianlai ge* (闲来阁) and *Yingbi xuan* (映碧轩), literary clubs in Yangon, Myanmar.60 In the late 19th century, Singapore was a centre and nursery for
this form of literature.

During the same period in Nanyang, there was also a commercial and
cultural network that was centred on Singapore and largely orchestrated by
the Straits Chinese.61 These Straits Chinese translated works from classical
Chinese and expressed Nanyang sentiments in their writings, which (in
my opinion) also forms part of Nanyang Literature. Compared to Chineselanguage
printing, the survival rate of printed Nanyang Literature in
romanised Malay during the same period was much higher.

According to a survey conducted in 2002, it was revealed that 18 Chinese
literary works translated into the Baba Malay language between 1889 and
1899 had survived in the major libraries in Singapore and Malaysia.62 (See
Appendix II for a list of these titles.) The key persons responsible for these
translated works were Chan Kim Boon and Tan Beng Teck (translators),
Chek Swee Liong and Peng Swee (translator and publisher respectively), Lim
Hock Kee (editor), Pang Teck Joon (translator), Lye Kim Lim (publisher)
and Goh Len Joo (translator).

#### **Conclusion**
Singapore played multiple roles in the early printing of Chinese language
materials over time as well as in response to historical events. In the first half
of the 19th century, two events occurring almost simultaneously incidentally
made Singapore into a centre of Chinese-language printing outside China. It
later played a supporting role in the information war waged in Guangdong.

Through LMS ’s, ABCFM’s and SDK ’s Singapore Chinese language
publications, Singapore became a conduit of Western culture and ideology
to China and contributed new Chinese terms to the Chinese language.

After the Protestant missionaries left Singapore, local commercial presses
and newspaper presses run by local Chinese emerged to meet domestic and
regional demand.

They contributed to making Singapore conducive for learning the lingua
franca of society, a platform to champion Confucianism and Chinese
nationalism, as well as a nursery for regional literature in the Chinese
language and romanised Malay to emerge and grow over time.
