description: Tay Seow Huah, then Permanent Secretary for the Home Affairs
  Ministry, helmed Singapore’s response to the 1974 Laju hijacking incident.
  This was when four terrorists tried (but failed) to destroy Shell’s oil
  infrastructure on Pulau Bukom Besar and subsequently took five hostages.
  Little is known about the enigmatic spy chief, who was the founding Director
  of the Security and Intelligence Division. Simon Tay, lawyer, academic and
  winner of the 2010 Singapore Literature Prize, tells us about how his father –
  a Penang-born who lived through WWII, the Malayan Emergency and the political
  tumult of the 1960s – came to play a giant role serving a newly independent
  Singapore.
