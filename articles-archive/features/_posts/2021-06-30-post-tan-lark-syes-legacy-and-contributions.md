#### **Lee Meiyu** looks back at the life of rubber tycoon Tan Lark Sye, long-time chairman of Hokkien Huay Kuan and the founder of the former Nanyang University in Singapore.

In October 2019, a ceremony was held at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) to mark the renaming of a road. Originally called Nanyang Valley, the small road leading to the Chinese Heritage Centre was renamed Tan Lark Sye Walk at an event attended by then Minister for Education Ong Ye Kung.[^1]

The new road name commemorates the efforts of a man who was the driving force behind the setting up of Nanyang University, a predecessor institution of NTU. Nantah, as it was known, was set up as a result of the rubber tycoon’s vision, determination and personal interest. He mooted the idea for the university in the early 1950s, pledged to personally donate $5 million to it, and was the first chairman of the university’s executive committee, a role he held for almost a decade.

The setting up of Nantah was a major point of pride for the Chinese community in Malaya. Thanks to Tan’s tireless efforts on behalf of the university, his name became indelibly linked with the institution. Unfortunately, Tan’s advocacy on behalf of Nantah was one of the reasons that led him into conflict with the government, culminating in his Singapore citizenship being revoked in 1964 following an inquiry into his political activities.

Although Tan ceased to be a citizen, he chose to continue living here. He focused on his businesses until his death from a heart attack about a decade later. Nantah soldiered on until 1980, when it merged with the University of Singapore to form the National University of Singapore. The next year, Nanyang Technological Institute (NTI) was set up on the premises of Nantah, and in 1991, it was renamed NTU.[^2]

##### Building a Business Empire
Although Tan was one of the key figures behind the founding of Nantah, he himself did not have much formal education. Tan was born in 1897 in the town of Jimei, part of Tong’an county, in China’s Fujian province. The sixth of seven brothers, Tan was orphaned as a child. He spent a few years at Jimei School, which had been set up by Tan Kah Kee, a prominent businessman and community leader in Singapore, who had also hailed from the same town.

In 1916, the 19-year-old Tan left China for Southeast Asia and found employment at one of the companies founded by Tan Kah Kee. The capable young man later worked in the latter’s Khiam Aik rubber factory in Singapore[^3], and after amassing enough capital and experience, decided to strike out on his own. In 1923, at the age of 26, Tan started Lian Hoe Rubber Shop with one of his older brothers, which was incorporated as Aik Hoe Rubber Company in the following year.[^4]

Thanks to Tan’s business acumen, Aik Hoe became one of the leading players in the rubber trade and by 1938, the company had business interests throughout Southeast Asia as well as agencies in New York and London. In October 1938, Aik Hoe was reorganised as a private limited company with a registered and paid-up capital of $1 million.[^5]

Apart from rubber, Tan was also involved in the finance, paper and cement industries. He set up Asia Insurance Company and Overseas Union Bank together with Lien Ying Chow, and served as a director of Oversea-Chinese Bank and chairman of Chiyu Banking Corporation Ltd in Hong Kong. Two of his companies, Lima Paper Products Co. Ltd and Tasek Cement Co. Ltd., were listed on the stock exchanges of Singapore and Malaysia.[^6]

##### Citizenship for Foreign-born Chinese
Having spent the first two decades of his life in China, Tan’s initial political allegiance was to the land of his birth.[^7]  However, after the People’s Republic of China (PRC) was formed in 1949, ties between the British colonial government and the PRC were severed and Tan, by then in his early 50s, decided to focus his attention on Singapore where most of his businesses were located.[^8]

In 1950, Tan became the chairman of the powerful Hokkien Huay Kuan, which represented the largest dialect group in Singapore. He had been appointed to this position by the previous chairman, Tan Kah Kee, who was 23 years his senior. In the latter’s opinion, the younger Tan had the requisite determination to lead the clan association.

The Hokkien Huay Kuan under Tan Lark Sye contributed much to social welfare and education in Singapore. During the two decades of his leadership, the association supported the maintenance and expansion of five Chinese-medium schools: Tao Nan School, Ai Tong School, Chong Hock Girls’ School, Nan Chiau School and Kong Hwa School.[^9]

Apart from heading the Hokkien Huay Kuan, Tan was also involved with the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce. He was its chairman from 1950 to 1952 and, in this capacity, pushed for the chamber to be involved in politics. His main concern was to seek the enfranchisement of the Chinese community in Singapore as the majority of foreign-born Chinese residents were not eligible to vote in local elections. “The chamber ought to be concerned with politics and the Chinese people ought to fight for voting rights for the legislature and the City Council,” he argued in 1951. “They should organise themselves and help the less well-informed to register for citizenship and try to get those who care for the well-being of the Chinese elected as legislators.”[^10]

The Chinese Chamber of Commerce thus led the fight in pushing for citizenship to be granted to foreign-born Chinese who had been residing in Singapore for many years. The citizenship issue was finally resolved in 1957 when the Citizenship Ordinance came into force, which granted citizenship to more than 200,000 foreign-born Chinese residents.[^11]

Later, as a committee member of the chamber, Tan also advocated for the use of vernacular languages (Chinese, Malay and Tamil) in the Legislative Assembly and City Council so that non-English-speaking candidates could be elected. In 1955, the chamber submitted a resolution to the colonial government calling for the abolition of the English-only rule and also rallied various local communities to sign a petition that subsequently garnered support from about 140,000 residents. As a result of these efforts, the language restriction was lifted in 1959 when the first fully elected Legislative Assembly was formed.[^12]

##### The Founding of Nanyang University
Given Tan’s history of advocacy on behalf of the Chinese community, it is not surprising that he would push for the founding of a Chinese university in Malaya. On 17 March 1950, a Nanyang Siang Pau article noted that Chinese-educated students were unable to attend the University of Malaya because English proficiency was one of the mandatory entry requirements. A few days later, the university announced that it would establish a Chinese Department and also suggested that qualified Chinese-educated students could apply for admission. Tan donated $300,000 to the university upon hearing the news.

In a meeting with the Hokkien Huay Kuan in September that year, Tan proposed setting up a Chinese university modelled after Yenching University or Tsinghua University in Beijing or Xiamen University in Fujian.[^13]

The proposal did not make much headway initially. However, the delay in setting up a Chinese Department in the University of Malaya eventually prompted Tan to raise the idea of a local Chinese university again, which he did in January 1953 during a meeting of the Hokkien Huay Kuan. Tan said in the meeting that “the prevailing political situation will deny our Chinese high school graduates an opportunity of higher education. We have no choice but to set up a Chinese university ourselves”.[^14]

Tan was also concerned about the shortage of teachers in Singapore’s Chinese-medium secondary schools as teachers from China had been barred from coming after ties were cut between Singapore and the PRC. Chinese-educated high school leavers were trapped in Singapore because if they chose to go to university in China, the colonial government was unlikely to allow them to return home.[^15]

Plans for a Chinese university in Singapore were stepped up. A committee made up of representatives from 12 influential Chinese organisations held a meeting on 20 February 1953, and the delegates decided that the name of this new institute would be “Nanyang University” (Nanyang Daxue, 南洋大学; abbreviated as Nantah, 南大). “Nanyang” means “South Seas”, which was how the Chinese then referred to Southeast Asia.[^16]

Setting up a new university would require money, and Tan issued a call for donations, noting that education was investment in the future:

“When the tide comes in, we should harness it to irrigate the fields, and then the field would produce good yield. If we do nothing… this swell of wealth is meaningless to us. Within moments, the tide will recede, as will our wealth. Therefore, if you know that your children are good learners, would you not want to contribute to nurture their talents? If you are wealthy and understand that money comes and goes like the tide, would you not want to put it to good use before it is too late?” 

Tan himself announced that he would personally donate $5 million while the Hokkien Huay Kuan, which he chaired, gave 500 acres of land in Jurong for the university campus. 

The idea of having a local Chinese university fired the enthusiasm of the Chinese community here and the subsequent fundraising effort became a massive campaign with people from all walks of life rallying to the call. It was a matter of great pride to the Chinese community to have a university and the Chinese in Malaya wanted to be part of the effort. 

However, not everyone was in favour of the idea. The colonial government was initially unsupportive as they were concerned about communist elements infiltrating Singapore and Malaya in the 1950s, and were worried that the university would become a breeding ground for communism. They were also concerned about the university’s standards and whether there was enough money to support a second university in Singapore. 

Some members of the Malay community were fearful that the establishment of a Chinese university, with its emphasis on the Chinese language, would disrupt racial harmony. They were also worried that the university would only admit ethnic Chinese students. 

To his detractors, Tan Lark Sye argued that the setting up of a university would benefit the country. “Think how important a university is to Malaya. Think of the thousands of students who could not have higher studies and are therefore forced to take lower appointments. I am not a university graduate but I know how important it is to have higher studies,” he declared.  

Businessman and prominent community leader Tan Cheng Lock helped to allay the concerns of both the colonial government and the Malay community. Finally, on 5 May 1953, Nanyang University was registered, albeit as a private limited company and not as a university to avoid complications.  

The next day, Tan Lark Sye announced that politics would be banned from the university. “We will not tolerate professors, lecturers, students or even the Chancellor if any of them should be found participating in political activities inside the university,” he said.
