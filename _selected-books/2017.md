#### <a target="_blank" href="https://nlb.overdrive.com/media/3706118" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">The Rare Materials Collection: Selections from the National Library Singapore</a>
<p>This book contains 50 specially curated items from the Rare Materials Collection, researched and written by a team of librarians from the National Library. Each article in this book contains a detailed description of the rare item as well as highlights of its history and provenance. Distilling 50 items from a 19,000-strong collection was a challenging task, and the final selection is at best only a representative snapshot of the complete repository.
