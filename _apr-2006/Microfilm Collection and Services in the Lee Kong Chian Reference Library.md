#### Microfilming the National Library’s collections began in the 1950s to preserve and archive Singapore’s documentary heritage. The collection includes newspapers; rare and out-of-print books; periodicals and directories; government publications; and dissertations.

Microfilming the National Library’s collections began in the 1950s. It was initiated as a move to preserve and archive Singapore’s documentary heritage. Beginning with a collection of old newspapers and manuscripts, microfilming activities was stepped up to include the filming of government records, as well as rare and out-of-print Singapore materials.

Over the years, this collection was further enhanced through the addition of titles acquired from the British Library, Malaysian libraries, National University of Singapore Library, University Microfilms International and the Library of Congress. Today, the collection has grown to an extensive archive of 24,000 microfilm reels and 12,500 fiches that forms an integral part of the Singapore and Southeast Asian collections at the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library.

The collection, housed at Level 11 of the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library, is an invaluable and rich resource to many users, from the researcher of Singapore history, the student conducting social and business research, the heritage seeker pouring through Singapore’s earliest imprints and Jawi manuscripts, to the individual tracing his family roots.

The microform collection can be broadly categorised into newspapers, rare and out-of-print books, periodicals and directories, government publications and dissertations.

#### **Newspapers**
The most popularly used resource is the newspaper archives. The collection comprises approximately 100 Singapore/Malayan newspapers dating back to 1827 with the publication of *Singapore Chronicle and Commercial Register* (1827–1937). In addition to the English newspapers, papers in the vernacular, namely Chinese, Malay/Jawi, and the Indian languages (Tamil/ Malayalam/ Punjabi) are also represented.

The English-language press sources include major papers namely *The Singapore Free Press* (1835– 1869, 1884–1962), *The Straits Times* (1845–), *The Singapore Daily Times* (1865–1882), *The Malaya Tribune* (1914–1951), *The Syonan Shimbun* (1942–1945), *Singapore Standard* (1950–1959) and *The Singapore Herald* (1970–1971) amongst others. The collection also contains a host of short-lived papers such as *Times of Malaya* (1938–1939) and *Eastern Daily Mail* (1905–1908) which appeared during the early 20th century; *The Eastern Sun* (1966–1971) and *New Nation* (1971–1982) in the 1960s–70s; *The Singapore Monitor* (1982–1985) in the 1980s and more recently, *Project Eyeball* (2000–2001) and *Streats* (2003–2004). The library also acquires Malaysian newspapers with bearings on the history of Singapore. An example is *The Malay Mail* (1896–1981) which carried news on federal proceedings in Kuala Lumpur.
