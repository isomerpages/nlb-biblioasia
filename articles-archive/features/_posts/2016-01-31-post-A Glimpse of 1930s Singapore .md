Imagine reading this about Singapore in a travel guide: “one of the cesspools of the world”, a place with “no ancient history, no romantic background”, “a paradise for second-class people”, a city with “wild night-life and opium dens”, and having a “terrible climate” that causes “bad health”.1

An erudite Singapore-born Englishman who disagreed with these swipes about the island felt compelled to write a book and debunk prevailing Western impressions of his birthland.

Published in 1934, Roland St. John Braddell’s *The Lights of Singapore* is an informative but yet light-hearted insider’s look at life in the colony in the early 20th century. Written between April and November 1933,2 the book was mainly targeted at Westerners but its engaging tongue-incheek style won many more readers over, its first print run of 500 copies selling out in only four days.3

The book distinguished itself from other expatriate traveller accounts of the day because it was written entirely from the point of view of a local – albeit 
one who was clearly white and from a privileged class.4
As one reviewer so succinctly put it: “to many European 
residents Mr Braddell has given a new pair of spectacles through which to see Singapore”.5
