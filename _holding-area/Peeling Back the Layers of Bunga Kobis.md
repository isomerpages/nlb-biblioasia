#### _Bunga kobis_ was a dish prepared only for special occasions because of how laborious it was to make. In this episode, librarian Toffa Abdul Wahed tells us more in her attempt to put together this many-layered pastry.

#### **Episode summary** ####
_Bunga kobis_, or “cabbage flower” in Malay, isn’t made of flowers or cabbages. So how did it get its name? Join librarian and food researcher Toffa Abdul Wahed as she tackles this recipe from a 1986 cookbook by Hajjah Asfiah Haji Abdullah, _Hidangan Warisan Kita_ (_Our Heritage Dishes_), and explains how it used to be a highlight at Malay weddings in Singapore a few decades ago. Today, this dish is no longer seen at special occasions.
