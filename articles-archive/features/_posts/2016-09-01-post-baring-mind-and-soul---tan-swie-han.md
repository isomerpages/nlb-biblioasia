#### After a long absence of 43 years, Singapore’s celebrated multi-hyphenate artist returns to the National Library with a new solo exhibition. **Chung Sang Hong** tells you more.

Journaling has been used by great artists since time immemorial. Michelangelo’s notebooks are not only a priceless archive of his creative inspirations but also offer a rare glimpse into his private life. From snippets of poetry, random doodles and ethereal drawings to memos and practical listings of food and expenses, the notebooks cast a light into the Italian master’s inner world; the connections and juxtapositions of words and images divulge the thinking and creative processes behind his works.[^1]

That same deep introspection, an intimate baring of the mind and soul as it were, is similarly revealed in the private notebooks of Tan Swie Hian, whom Time magazine proclaimed in 2003 as “Singapore’s Renaissance man”.2 For those who are familiar with the works of Tan, this epithet is a justifiably fitting tribute.

Now for the first time, the National Library, Singapore, presents the acclaimed artist’s never-before-published notebooks as well as his celebrated works of art and writings in an exhibition entitled “Anatomy of a Free Mind: Tan Swie Hian’s Notebooks and Creations”. To be showcased at level 10 of the National Library Building, the exhibition opens its doors to the public on 22 November 2016.

The notebooks, which Tan has since donated to the National Library, are key to understanding the psyche and creative thinking of this much-lauded artist. Containing sketches, drawings and writings, they are a window to Tan’s formidable mind, which he describes as an “immense web with myriads of beings hanging.”3 The exhibition aims to draw people into the unfettered mind and soul of the artist, and reveal how his ideas, passions, philosophical insights and spiritual enlightenment are manifested through his artistic and literary creations.

Tan refers to his notebooks as his “secret garden”, and he is thus the diligent and disciplined “gardener” who painstakingly and lovingly cultivates and nurtures the seedlings of inspiration. So intrinsically important are these notebooks that Tan considers them as his “companions in life”: they never leave his side – they are stashed into his briefcase, they clutter his desk and even his bedside.

The pages are filled from cover to cover, with almost every square inch of space used for his creative musings – sketches of visions from his meditations, drawings of his inner and outer realities, poetry verses, revisited memories, reflections on his latest creations, annotations of ancient classical texts he has read, and more.4

To Tan, the notebooks serve the important purpose of documentation and reference – as a cerebral artist he writes before, during or after the execution of his works – and to the interested observer, they offer rare vistas of the artist’s creative mindscape.

#### **Singapore’s Renaissance Man**

Tan Swie Hian was born in Indonesia in 1943 and moved to Singapore when he was three. While as a student at the Chinese High School, Tan already displayed his prodigious talents in art, calligraphy and poetry. He later pursued a degree in Modern Languages and Literature at Nanyang University, graduating in 1968. In the same year he published his first anthology, The Giant – a collection of Chinese modernist poetry – a landmark work that earned him recognition as a poet of standing.5 Since then, Tan has published close to 40 collections of poetry, essays, novels, fables, critiques and translated works.

The year 1973 was a turning point in Tan’s life: he received spiritual illumination for the first time and deepened his faith in Buddhism. After this metaphysical awakening, Tan channeled his creative energies into the visual arts and took the path towards becoming an artist, expressing himself through different media and genres. As a deeply religious person, the tenets of Buddhist teachings are apparent in many of his works, which often depict the spiritual insights and visions gleaned from his meditations.

As a polymath, Tan has a natural affinity for languages – he is proficient in Mandarin, English, French and Malay – and is widely read, being well versed in both Eastern and Western philosophic traditions. His creations are therefore enriched by diverse cultural influences. Although deeply steeped in Chinese artistic traditions, Tan straddles the visual languages of the East and the West, freely fusing and experimenting with different art forms in his work.

#### **A String of Awards and Accolades**

Tan has won a string of prestigious awards both locally – including the Cultural Medallion in 1987, and the Meritorious Service Medal in 2003 for his contributions to Singapore culture – and internationally. In 2003, the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, conferred on Tan the Crystal Award for his outstanding artistic achievements and contribution to cross-cultural understanding. And in 2006, he received the Officier de l’Ordre National de la Legion d’Honneur (Officer in the National Order of the Legion of Honour) medal – France’s highest honour for individuals who have distinguished themselves in civilian or military life.

Time and again, Tan’s paintings have made headline news as they set record prices in art auctions.6 In December 2012, his oil and acrylic work, “When the Moon is Orbed”, fetched an astounding RMB18.975 million (S$3.7 million) at a Beijing art auction.7 Barely two years later, his ink-on-rice-paper painting, “Portrait of Bada Shanren”, went under the gavel for a record RMB20.7 million (S$4.4 million) in Beijing.8 With this sale, Tan has clearly made his name as the most expensive living artist in Southeast Asia.

More recently in May 2016, a set of six lithographed sketches done by former South African president Nelson Mandela – someone whom Tan greatly admires – and painted over by the artist was sold for HK$3.52 million (S$630,000), the highest-paid piece at an auction in Hong Kong. The images depict the hands and arms of Mandela breaking free from manacles.[^9]
