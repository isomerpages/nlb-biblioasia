#### **With its sometime unconventional treatments, the Zhenkongjiao worked together with local authorities to remove the scourge of opium addiction in Singapore.**

Prayers, meditation, tea infused with prayers and even animal sacrifice – these were part of a plan to rehabilitate opium addicts in Singapore by a Chinese religious movement known as &nbsp;Zhenkongjiao in postwar Singapore.[^1]

The Zhenkongjiao are guided by religious texts known as the Four Books in Five Volumes, and still recite them today. The movement adheres to a syncretic belief system that integrates teachings from Confucianism, Daoism and Buddhism. This belief system accompanied its arrival in this region in the early 20th century. Zhenkongjiao temples feature five thrones – one for each of the movement’s patriarchs: Liao Dipin (b. 1827), Lai Renzhang (b. 1857), Ling Bangbi (b. 1849), Zhang Shengjian (b. 1852), and Lan Juying (b. 1859) – with altar walls displaying cosmology and ethical systems instead of deity images.[^2]

The Zhenkongjiao’s scriptures and ethical systems were influenced by Mahayana Buddhist philosophies, but they also practiced animal sacrifice through a ritual euphemistically termed the “scattering of flowers”. Livestock such as pigs and chickens were sacrificed to alleviate (the animals’) sponsors’ misfortunes and provide the sacrificed animals with a better afterlife.[^3] However, since the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Singapore in 2003, these ceremonies have ceased. Besides scripture recitation, the Zhenkongjiao also practice meditation and other therapeutic rituals such as sleeping on charcoal beds covered with sand in a ritual known as “laying in the emptiness”, performed in the pursuit of good health.

A survey of Zhenkongjiao temples on the island in 1968 found that there were as many as 25 of them in Singapore. Today, only six remain: Thian Ling Toh Tong in Bukit Batok, Poon Guan San Toh Tong in Pasir Panjang, Kong Leap Thiam Lim Tua in Geylang, Chin Kong Religion Fook Poon Tong in Yishun, Hean Thuan Toh Tong in Tampines Link, and Fubenyuan Daotang (now located in a private residence, having moved from its original location in Hougang).

#### **Early History of the Zhenkongjiao in Singapore**

The Zhenkongjiao was founded in Jiangxi, China, by Liao Dipin (1827–93) and popularised by his family members and disciples. Its influence expanded to southeastern China, particularly the regions of Guangdong, Fujian and Chaoshan. When the Chinese from these regions migrated to Southeast Asia during the 19th century, they brought Zhenkongjiao with them.[^4] The early pioneers of Zhenkongjiao in Singapore were mostly Hakkas from southeastern China, particularly the Jiaoling and Meixian regions in Guangdong.[^5]

The inaugural Zhenkongjiao temple in Southeast Asia, Pili Hongmaodan Zhenkong Zushi Daotang, was founded in Ipoh in 1906 by Huang Shengfa and his teacher, Master Huang Daoyun. After struggling with opium addiction in Malaya, Huang Shengfa returned to Jiaoling, where Master Huang Daoyun treated him before accepting his invitation to Malaya. From Ipoh, the duo extended the influence of Zhenkongjiao in Malaya, each embarking on divergent paths. Huang Daoyun travelled southward to Singapore, where he founded the second-oldest temple in the region, Xingzhou Fubenyuan Daotang, in 1910.[^6] By 1929, five other Zhenkongjiao temples had been established across the island, founded by other masters of the movement who had travelled to Southeast Asia to proselytise. Later in his life, Huang Shengfa established Fook Poon Yuen Temple on Penang Island in Malaysia, which is still managed by his descendants today.
