#### The former newsreader AGS Danaraj was also a pioneering town planner, who always made time to help the less fortunate.
By Edgar J. Danaraj

Some people might remember AGS Danaraj as a newsreader on radio and television in the 1960s and 70s. But many might not know that beyond reading the news, Danaraj was an important figure in the development of Singapore’s urban landscape as one of the nation’s pioneering town planners.

#### **On the News**

Danaraj, who was my father, was a part-time radio and television newsreader with the Radio Television Singapura and Singapore Broadcasting Cooperation for 19 years in the 1960s and 1970s.&nbsp; He spent two years on a government scholarship at Durham University in Britain from 1958 to 1960 to study town planning. His interest and love for journalism blossomed while he was there and he would freelance for newspapers during term breaks. He recalled, "I risked my life when I covered the Nottingham racial riots back in the 60s, but I loved every minute of it. I was paid about $50 to $200 for an article.”[^1]

When Danaraj returned to Singapore, he spoke with a British accent, commonly known as pure “received pronunciation” or “The Queen’s English”. This made his voice distinctive and easily recognised. After six months of training, he went on air.

Being a part-time newsreader could occasionally be harrowing. Once, he was so late for a news-reading session because of a traffic jam that he abandoned his car at Mount Alvernia and hailed a passing police car. He asked them for a ride to the broadcasting station and the police not only gave him a lift, they even sounded their sirens to get him there.[^2]&nbsp;

As a newsreader, Danaraj presented more than 38 broadcasts on radio and television. He covered a diverse range of topics, from “Redeveloping Toa Payoh”[^3] and “Rebuilding the City”[^4] to “Batik-Making”[^5] and “Keeping Birds as a Hobby”.[^6]
