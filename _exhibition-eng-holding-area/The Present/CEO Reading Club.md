**About**:	Established in 1999, CEO Reading Club serves as a dedicated literary platform for local business owners, creating a unique space where entrepreneurship meets intellectual enrichment. Through carefully curated reading selections, members expand their perspectives and deepen their understanding of diverse subjects, whilst structured book discussions foster dynamic intellectual exchanges and collaborative learning. Each book discussion session functions as an intellectual symposium, where business leaders draw inspiration not only from the texts themselves but from the varied insights and experiences of their peers. This rich dialogue enables members to enhance their business acumen, refine their management approaches, and develop more nuanced leadership capabilities. By bridging the worlds of literature and commerce, the Reading Club demonstrates that sustained intellectual engagement can serve as a powerful catalyst for professional growth and business innovation.
