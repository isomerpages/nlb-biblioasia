Let any unprejudiced European walk through the native<br> 
towns of Java, Singapore and China and see if he can find a<br> 
single native drunk. What he will meet with are numbers of<br> 
drunken English, Scotch and Irish seamen literally rolling<br> 
in the gutters, intoxicated, not from opium but from rum<br> 
and spirits sent all the way from England for the purpose of<br> 
enabling her worthy sons to exhibit themselves to Chinese<br> 
and other nations in this disgraceful light.1

First published in 1846, the above passage by G. F. Davidson was
reproduced in the *Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (SFPMA)*
in 1909.2 Europeans who were publicly drunk, in full view of Asians, were
described in the passage as problematic. Extant research on Europeans’
alcohol consumption in British colonies has shown that such perception
was informed by European anxieties surrounding white racial prestige.3

The drinking habits of low-class Europeans, such as seamen and sailors,
elicited anxiety. Barred from accessing exclusively “European” spaces due
to a lack of means as well as class- and profession-based restrictions, these
Europeans typically obtained and consumed alcohol in “public” or spaces
where they intermingled with Asians. The mechanics of inclusion-exclusion
among Europeans operated in part to define “Europeanness”. Its boundaries
were often contingent on “deviance”, even as what was considered deviant
was unfixed and constantly challenged. Examining the ways in which
“European deviance” was defined in different contexts and used as an
apparatus to differentiate between Europeans reveals the heterogeneity of
the colonial society, which is so often portrayed otherwise.4

As the opening quote suggests, the problematisation of some behaviour
such as public drunkenness was conceptualised in relation to its visibility
to the Asian population. Such exposures, according to colonial rhetoric,
potentially lowered European prestige in the eyes of the colonised. Yet,
to what extent was this concern justified in reality? Thus, apart from
examining the ways in which Europeans constructed European deviance,
I am interested in how Asians regarded such behaviour. Reviewing how
incidents of European deviant behaviour were reported in English- and
Chinese-language newspapers sheds light on the issue. The existing research
on newspapers in colonial Singapore helps elucidate the similarities and
differences between the two.5

This paper presents a comparative reading of reports on European
deviant behaviour in English- and Chinese-language newspapers in 1923–41,
the prewar period when the Chinese-language newspaper *Nanyang Siang
Pau* (南洋商报) is available in microfilm. I have focused on examining
the *Nanyang Siang Pau* in an extension of my previous research that had
examined English-language newspapers exclusively. As *Nanyang Siang Pau*
was a long-running daily newspaper, I examined one issue per month in
order to cover the entire period. Other newspapers, such as the *Malaya
Tribune*, the *Straits Times*, *SFPMA*, and *Sin Chew Jit Poh* (星洲日报),
served as cross-references. Examining the press coverage of the inquests
into the deaths of two Europeans, Douglas Vincent Gibson and Olvard
Wohl Schroeder, reveals varied perceptions of deviance and its role in social
categorisation.
