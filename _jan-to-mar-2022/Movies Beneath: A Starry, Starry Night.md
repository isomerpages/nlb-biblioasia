#### The Jurong Drive-in was Singapore’s one and only drive-in cinema. In its heyday in the 1970s, it was packed bumper to bumper with vehicles. **Sharon Teng** tracks its rise and subsequent decline.

A drive-in cinema conjures up breezy fun, adventure and romance under the stars. Singapore’s one and only drive-in cinema, the former Jurong Drive-in, opened 50 years ago. It only lasted 15 years but during its short lifespan, it left indelible memories.

The Jurong Drive-in Cinema opened on 14 July 1971 and it was touted as the next “in-thing” that would revolutionise the movie-watching experience. Constructed at an estimated cost of $3 million, this was the first drive-in cinema in Singapore and Malaysia and also the largest in Asia at the time. 

A full-page announcement was published in the Straits Times on the day of the cinema’s opening. In it, the Deputy Chairman of Cathay Organisation, Heah Hock Meng, wrote that the new drive-in promised that patrons would be treated to first-class movie entertainment and there would be “no parking problems, no parking fees; no need to worry about acoustics because every car will have its own speaker which can be adjusted to suit the patron’s needs”. In addition, patrons would not have to “worry about what you wear… [and if] the baby cries or your wife inadvertently drops her handbag with a clatter at a crucial moment in the film, you will get no hard looks because, of course, you have complete privacy in your own car”.[^1]
