Dr Carl Alexander Gibson-Hill (23 October 1911–18 August 1963) was the last expatriate director of the Raffles Museum. His work in Singapore straddled the period between World War II and Singapore’s independence, when British defeat at the hands of the Japanese and the rise of nationalism reshaped the landscape of Malayan politics and history. The collection he acquired thus reflects both the heritage of English adventure and colonialism in the East as well as narratives of Malayans seeking to define their own history. The collection also facilitated his work as curator and editor in two esteemed institutions – the Raffles Museum and the Asiatic Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society. On 18 June 1965, the Gibson-Hill Collection was donated to the National Library through the Loke family, owners of a cinema chain. Today, the Gibson-Hill Collection is an important component in the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library.

#### **Imprisoned Yet Free**

A trained medical doctor, Gibson-Hill was an avid naturalist since childhood. He won awards for entomology at school and was a keen photographer and illustrator of animal life since his teenaged years. Gibson-Hill served almost three years as the resident medical doctor at Christmas Island and the Cocos-Keelings Islands. Meanwhile Frederick N. Chasen, the then curator of the Raffles Museum, and an ornithologist himself had tasked Gibson-Hill to build up the Museum’s bird specimen collection. Today, Gibson-Hill’s Christmas Island birds, labelled in his own hand, are found at the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research.

Gibson-Hill arrived in Singapore on 12 December 1941, just weeks prior to Singapore’s fall to the Japanese. He was hastily appointed curator in the absence of his predecessor and within a few days was interned at Changi and Sime Road Camp. But Gibson-Hill did not stop his academic pursuits. He took notes and drew sketches of local birds he observed at the camp. This resulted in several articles on local birds, including the Malayan Long-tailed Tailor-Bird (Gibson-Hill, 1950, December: 82–97) and the Spotted Munia (Gibson-Hill, 1950, December: 82: 98–113), with his illustrations added to an in-house publication by G. C. Madoc entitled *Malayan Birds* (Madoc, 1942, 1947). Whilst at the camp, he also mentally reworked his manuscript on the Cocos-Keelings Islands. Unfortunately whatever was left of the original draft on the Cocos-Keelings Islands was found as wrapping paper and mere loose scraps, a loss which Gibson-Hill lamented in his introduction to his article on the Ross’ documents (Gibson-Hill, 1952, J*MBRAS*, 1–306).

#### **Bird Life**

Gibson-Hill took off for South Georgia (in Antarctica) almost immediately after his release from internment to study the birdlife there. The voyage, sponsored by the Falkland Island Museum, resulted in several minor articles and interesting additions to his book collection. Of the several books in his collection which reflects this voyage, one stands out – *Logbook for Grace* (1947) by Robert Cushman Murphy. Murphy, an established ornithologist in the 1940s, was newly married when he set off on his journey to South Georgia in 1912. The book is a compilation of Murphy’s private letters to his young bride, Grace. The story seemed to parallel Gibson-Hill’s who was separated from his wife during his years in internment, but even so left for further adventure before rejoining her in Britain. Whilst on leave in Britain, he worked on his earlier publications *British Sea Birds* (1947) and *Birds of the Coast* (1948).1 Reviewers considered them good overviews of British coastal birds and valued the accompanying photographs and illustrations done in Gibson-Hill’s own hand. Gibson-Hill thus established his reputation as an amateur ornithologist during a time when bird-watching became increasingly popular in Europe.

Upon his return to Singapore in 1947, he was appointed Assistant Curator of Zoology. Here Gibson-Hill continued his bird studies – this time of local birds - and soon published “Birds of Malaya” (Gibson-Hill, 1949, *Bull. Raff. Mus*. (20), 5–299) which built on the listings of his predecessors and the specimen collection found in Singapore’s Museum. The Gibson-Hill Collection invariably has a rich collection of titles on birds both locally as well as from the various continents. These include the standard handlists, checklists and manuals of birds namely of Thailand, Ceylon, Australia, New Zealand, Malaya, Singapore, UK and the Americas. More importantly, they include titles with finely illustrated drawings of birds. One example is Sutter’s *Paradiesvogel und Kolibris* \[Birds of Paradise and Humming Birds\] (1953). There are 60 mounted full-page plates of these magnificent tropical birds in brilliant colour, illustrated by the famed Swiss artist Walter Linsenmaier showing them in shimmering plumage, perched proudly or in flight. GibsonHill also collected photographic works of the leading bird photographers of his day. These included works such as Hosking’s *Masterpieces of bird photography* (1947) and his *Birds* in action (1949). However, it is Aymar’s *Bird flight* (1936) that is recognised as the first publication to study bird flight through photographs and which, evolved new theories of bird flight itself. The copy in the Collection was a gift from Gibson-Hill’s parents and was signed “Best wishes from mother and father, J. R. J. Gibson-Hill”.

Many of the other titles on birds in his collection are similarly signed by friends and family showing Gibson-Hill’s intimate relations with fellow birders. His brother-in-law, Bruce Campbell, a well-known naturalist in England, signed off the publication he authored - *Finding nests* (1953) with the simple phrase “To Carl Gibson-Hill with best wishes Bruce Campbell”. Similarly, fellow birder and cinema magnate Loke Wan Tho signed off *A company of birds* (1957) with “To Carl with best wishes Wan Tho March 1958”. The book is a compilation of photographs of birds from Loke’s expeditions to India, New Guinea and within Malaya. The penned phrase is the only evidence in the Collection of the friendship that bound the men and would later lead to the donation of the Collection to the Library.


#### **Of Boats and Ships**

Besides taking charge of the bird specimens, Gibson-Hill was tasked to set up the Boat Room. This involved studies of local boats ranging from Malay *prahus* and *sampans* to Chinese *tongkangs* and Indian *dhows*. Being a proficient sailor himself, Gibson-Hill took to the task with fervour and passion as seen in his collection of titles on Asian boats and the *Sea Pilots* published by the British Hydrographic Department. His many articles in the *Journal of the Malayan Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society (JMBRAS)* concerning local boats makes him the authority on this subject even today. One of Gibson-Hill’s earliest articles on boats is entitled “Boats and fishing on the Cocos-Keelings Islands”, published in *The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute* (1946). He often took photographs of these water crafts to serve as a template for his illustrations. Although many of these published sketches were of unmanned boats, his photographs did capture the vibrant life of the boatmen and their fishing craft. They caught the sinewy, tanned bodies of Malay fishermen fluidly casting nets against the rising sun or boys playing in the waters whilst their fathers fished. Fluent in Malay, Gibson-Hill did not merely observe these sailing craft from a distance but had befriended these boatmen who would then take him up rivers and coasts to various locations to study birds and the islands.

The Gibson-Hill Collection comprises books on boat models as well as studies of Asian boats. Mitman’s *Catalogue of the watercraft collection in the United States* (1929) gives details of this collection which today is known as the Smithsonian, and includes mention of local boats such as the Malay *prahu* and Chinese* junk*. Selected ship models are photographed and accompanied by a detailed description of the craft. The titles on Asian boats, include Hornell’s books which describe Indian crafts (Hornell, 1920, 1924) and Waters which examines Chinese junks (1940).

The Gibson-Hill Collection, however, has a larger number of books on ships of European and American origins namely clipper ships, sailing ships, carracks and brigs. These include the works of Herbert Warington Smyth such as *Mast and sail in Europe and Asia* (1906) and Chatterton’s *The old East Indiamen* (1914). Other books on sailing histories, such as the Andersons’ *The sailing ship* (1926) and Chatterton’s *Sailing ships* (1909), trace shipbuilding history from ancient times until the 20th century. The history of sailing is also described through the histories of shipping companies such as Ewart’s *A hundred year history of the P &amp; O Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company* (1937) and MacGregor’s (1961) account of Killick Martin &amp; Co. A number of the titles, illustrated by skilled artists, are primarily a visual survey of classic ships touching even on the art of painting ships. Chatterton’s *Old sea paintings* (1928), for instance, studies the life and works of Dutch and English painters of sailing ships between the 14th and 19th centuries. Moses’ *Sketches of shipping* (1824) has etchings of port life at Portsmouth Harbour in 19th century England and it is believed that few copies of this work are extant.
