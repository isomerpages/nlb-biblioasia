#### **The Singapore Youth Orchestra’s practice of commissioning and performing the works of local composers was instrumental in the growth of Singapore music.**
By Vivien Goh

When the Singapore Youth Orchestra (SYO) was formed in 1980, part of its mission was to be a feeder to the Singapore Symphony Orchestra which had been set up the year before. However, in addition to nurturing young musicians, the orchestra’s other major contribution to Singapore was to feature the works of local composers. The founding chairman of the board of SYO, Bernard Tan, noted that the intention of the orchestra was to “show our support for Singaporean composers and to build up a body of Singapore works. No other music group, as far as I know, was doing this at the time.” This allowed Singapore composers to get their works performed while also exposing SYO members to local composers.[^1]

“I would like to think that our policy acted as a strong catalyst for Singapore composers to write orchestra works, and also served as an important showcase for them,” he added. “It also encouraged other music groups to perform the works of Singapore composers.”[^2]

During its first decade, under SYO’s founding music director and resident conductor Vivien Goh, a total of seven works were commissioned from local composers and one by the American John Sharpley. The new local works were “Dance Suite” by Leong Yoon Pin (premiered in 1982); “Variations on Dayong Sampan” by Phoon Yew Tien (premiered in 1985); “Stasis” by Tsao Chieh (premiered in 1988); “Fanfare for Joy” by Leong Yoon Pin (premiered in 1986); “Ascent” by Yan Yin Wing (premiered in 1987); “Symphony No. 1” by Bernard Tan (premiered in 1990); and “Salute to My Homeland” by Lim Chin Tiong (premiered in 1987). In 1985, John De Souza was commissioned to write an orchestral arrangement for his composition “Undaunted” that had originally been composed earlier that year. The SYO performed “Undaunted” and his 1980 composition “Sentosa” in 1985. In addition, the SYO also featured the works of American composers who resided in Singapore: David Campbell’s “Singapore Suite” (premiered in 1986) and Sharpley’s “Sojurn” (commissioned in 1988). Three commissioned works were taken on tour: “Dance Suite” to Rome, “Variations of Dayong Sampan” to Lancashire and London, and “Stasis” to Perth.

While the objective of supporting local composers was noble, the efforts were not always appreciated at the time, ironically by the musicians. SYO’s Goh recalled that the musicians usually “approached new compositions with feelings bordering on distaste. Since they often had to struggle with poor \[hand-written\] manuscripts, copyists’ errors, last minute changes by composers and submissions by composers two weeks before performance date, this is not surprising. To top all this, nobody knew what it was going to sound like at first reading. Sometimes even the composers were surprised by what they heard.”[^3]

Composers were told to temper the technical difficulties of their compositions considering the SYO’s young musicians, but some still “\[gave\] free rein to their imaginations. Once unleashed, the occasional result was music which was unlike anything the young musicians had ever played in their lives.”[^4]

From the 1990s to 2011, the SYO continued to commission new works by composers such as Tsao Chieh (“Prelude”, “Fugue” and “Fugato”, 1992), Leong Yoon Pin (“Metamorphosis”, 1993), Er Yenn Chwen (“Three Sketches for Choral and Orchestra”, 1994; “Opening Hearts for Choral and Orchestra”, 2002), Joyce Bee Tuan Koh (“Above Dancing Waters”, 1996), Howard John (“Symphonic Variations on Westron Wynde”, 1997), Kelly Tang (“Sinfonia Concertante”, 1998, “Symphonic Suite”, 2008), Ho Chee Kong (“Enchanted Paths”, 2000), Bernard Tan (“Overture to Youth”, 2001), Philip Tan (“Ten Months”, 2003), Robert Casteels (“Kriesleriana”, 2004), Phoon Yew Tien ( “Summer Rhapsody”, 2009), and Chen Zhangyi ( “A Carp Emerges”, 2011).[^5]
