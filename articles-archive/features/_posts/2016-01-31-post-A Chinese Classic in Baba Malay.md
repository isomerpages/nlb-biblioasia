Written in the 14th century and set during the last days of China’s Han dynasty and the tumultuous Three Kingdoms period (circa AD 220–280), the *Romance of the Three Kingdoms* is a well-known Chinese classic of epic proportions and a cast of thousands. In the late 1800s, a Baba Malay version of this classic was published in Singapore – making this popular tale more accessible to the Peranakan (Straits-born Chinese) community.1

Titled as *Chrita Dahulu-kala, Namanya Sam Kok, Atau, Tiga Negri Ber-prang: Siok, Gwi, Sama Gor di Jaman “Han Teow”* (henceforth referred to as *Sam Kok*), the series consists of 30 volumes translated from Chinese to Baba Malay. The translation was done by Chan Kim Boon, an administrator at law firm Aitken & Rodyk,2 with the help of two other people, Chia Ann Siang and Tan Kheam Hock.3

Published between 1892 and 1896 by Kim Sek Chye Press, the entire series totalled some 4,622 pages, and a single volume was sold at a $1 each.4 *Sam Kok* is most likely the earliest complete Malay translation of *Romance of the Three Kingdoms*, ahead of Indonesian versions from Java published in 1910.5 The series was 
typical of Baba Malay materials in Malaya 
at the time, where epic stories were serialised into multi-volume publications. This facilitated a subscription-based model that spurred the growth of the fledgling Baba publishing industry in Singapore.6

The majority of the translated Baba Malay literary works were heavily illustrated to complement the storyline and heighten the visual appeal of the publications. These drawings, rendered in the 
style of traditional Chinese woodcuts, 
usually featured main characters and 
events in the stories.7

Interestingly, Chan encouraged communication between himself and the readers and even among readers themselves by publishing letters in English, Chinese and Malay containing comments on previous volumes of the book. He also shared 
his trials and tribulations in producing the books as well as his financial woes, photographs of himself and his assistants and other private information.8

Such translations of Chinese historical novels into Baba Malay first took placein the 1880s in Batavia (now Jakarta). They 
were well-received by the Peranakan 
community there and soon made their 
way to Singapore.9
 The earliest translations in Singapore were undertaken by 
businessman Tan Beng Teck, who left for 
Japan and discontinued his translation 
works. Chan then took over, and even 
revised Tan’s earlier works.10
Chan became a dominant influence in 
the small Baba Malay publishing industry, 
gaining prominence for his translation 
of three popular Chinese classics: apart 
from Sam Kok, he also translated two 
other Chinese classics, Song Kang (Water 
Margin) and Kou Chey Tian (Journey to the 
West).
11 After his death in 1920, the translation of Chinese stories into Baba Malay 
declined,12 due in part to the Peranakan 
community’s increasing preference for 
English-language books.13
The son of a Penang trader, Chan was 
educated in English at the Penang Free 
School, and received private tuition in 
Chinese. He arrived in Singapore in March 
1872, and built a career as an administrator at Aitken & Rodyk. The book-keeper 
and cashier, however, became better 
known for his translations of Chinese clas-
