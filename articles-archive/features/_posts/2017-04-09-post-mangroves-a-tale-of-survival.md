#### Mangroves are an integral part of the marine ecosystem. **Ang Seow Leng** explains why these hardy and resilient plants are vital for the survival of humankind.

Mangroves, the forest between land and sea, are fast disappearing as the urban jungle encroaches on its existence and threatens its survival. Mangrove Watch, a global monitoring programme based in Australia that partners mangrove scientists and the community, has noted that the world’s mangroves are disappearing at an average of 2 percent a year.1

Mangroves are defined as “a tree, shrub, palm or ground fern, generally exceeding one half metre in height, that normally grows above mean sea level in the intertidal zone of marine coastal environments and estuarine margins”.2 The term mangrove is also used to describe the habitat that is made up of such trees and shrubs. Mangrove habitats are also known as “coastal woodlands”, “mangals”, “tidal forests” and “mangrove forests”.3 They are distributed in tropical and sub-tropical regions, with approximately 70 known species found in the world today.

#### **Mangrove Impressions**

According to the botanist Philip Barry Tomlinson, mangroves have existed since prehistoric times, dating back to the Paleocene period more than 60 million years ago. However, these hardy trees, with their maze of tangled roots, were researched and studied only from the 16th and 17th centuries onwards when European colonisation began.4

Mangrove swamps did not always leave a favourable impression on those who encountered them. In 1878, the zoologist William Hornaday (who was later appointed the first director of the New York Zoological Park, known today as the Bronx Zoo), was tasked to collect natural history specimens for a Professor Ward of Rochester, New York. Hornaday described his first glimpse of mangroves in Singapore:

“Entering Singapore by way of New Harbour is like getting into a house through the scullery window… For the first stage out from New Harbour, the road is built through a muddy and dismal mangrove swamp. Here and there we pass a group of dingy and weather-beaten Malay houses standing on posts over the soft and slimy mud, or perhaps over a thin sheet of murky water. Delightful situation, truly, for the habitations of civilized human beings. Monkey[s] would choose much better.”5

It was a more pleasant scene some 30 years later in 1908 when another visitor, Count Fritz von Hochberg, had this to say:

“… I was astonished to see how much had been done to the place since I was there four years ago. Lots of these swampy, feverish places around the harbor and the Chinese quarter have been filled up and planted, and it made the place ever so much nicer looking.”6

#### **The Mangrove Ecosystem**

Studies have shown that the “dismal” and “swampy, feverish” mangroves offer a myriad of uses and benefits for both humans and the environment. These fragile ecosystems provide shelter and protection for several species of fishes, crustaceans and reptiles as well as serve as feeding, nesting and roosting grounds for migratory birds.

Several flora and fauna species are indigenous to mangrove swamps in Singapore, such as the Singapore Rubble Crab, Favus granulatus, that was discovered in 1900 on our intertidal shores.7 Mangrove wood is used as fuel and for thatching, piling and construction purposes. Mangrove trees also act as an effective natural barrier and help to protect shorelines against soil erosion and tsunamis. Some species of mangroves are also used in traditional folk medicine as cures for various malaise.8

Perhaps, most importantly, mangroves act as carbon sinks to absorb huge amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere – between two and four times greater than the rates observed in mature tropical forests. In this sense, mangroves play a key role in mitigating the deleterious effects of climate change and global warming.9

A study carried out in late 2014 by a team of researchers from the National University of Singapore’s Department of Geography revealed that mangroves occupy just 960 hectares or less than 1 percent of the land area in Singapore, but store disproportionately high levels of carbon − 450,571.7 tonnes to be exact, or 3.7 percent of Singapore’s national carbon emissions in 2010.10 Additionally, mangroves are able to absorb heavy metals, metalloids and certain pollutants from the air, thus hampering the flow of toxins into the food chain.11

Unlike other plant species, the ever resilient mangroves can survive in oxygen-poor soils and high salinity environments. One of the ways in which mangroves survive in a hostile environment is to grow anchor roots that penetrate deep into the soft sediments as well as long aerial roots called pneumatophores that radiate from the trunk just beneath the soil to prop itself up above water. These breathing roots also perform the function of absorbing oxygen from the air. As a result, mangrove plants have developed a tangle of prop-root structures that are either pencil-like (Avicennia sp.) in appearance, resemble the human bent knee (Bruguiera sp.) or look like stilts (Rhizophora sp.).12
