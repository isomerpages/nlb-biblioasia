#### **Introduction**
In September 1935, a group of immigrant Chinese artists established the
Society of Chinese Artists (SOCA; 中華美術研究會), or Société des artistes
Chinois, in Singapore. These Modernist artists were distinct from the
preceding generation of artists, who were mostly born in the 19th century
and schooled in the classics under the tutelage of traditional scholars, and
whose works were produced in the traditional mode.

In this paper, I examine the prewar and postwar (late 1920s–early 1950s) art
scene in Singapore: the life and work of the active but lesser-known SOCA
Modernist founders, the relationships among them, the prevalent styles of
their work, the historical and social circumstances that shaped their art, and
the art spaces they used. Although these artists are neither well documented
nor canonised, they were part of the vibrant prewar and postwar art scene.
My study reveals a microcosm of artistic germination and rich human
dynamics in the prewar and postwar art scene and fills the gaps in our
knowledge of early Singapore art history.

The art scene from the turn of the 20th century up to the eve of Singapore’s
independence has been analysed by Yeo Mang Thong as consisting of four
strands of development:1

  1.  the period between the late 19th and early 20th centuries, centring<br> 
    around individuals of cultural influence, such as Khoo Seok Wan, his<br> 
    literary circle and the sojourning scholars who offered their literati<br> 
    skills (calligraphy and painting) to the Chinese mercantile community;

  2. the period corresponding to the Chinese Republican years, which saw<br> 
    the rise of graphic art (woodcut prints and cartoons) as a new form of<br> 
    social expression, and a group of Modernist artists in exile from China,<br> 
    mostly members of SOCA;

  3. Singapore under the Japanese Occupation (1942–45); and

  4. unique artistic personalities, namely Tchang Ju-ch’i, Situ Qiao, both<br>
    prominent patriotic artists of the prewar period, and Austrian sculptor<br>
    Karl Duldig, who lived and worked in Singapore in 1939–40.

The present study focuses on the second strand of development, drawing on
a wide range of materials, including public and private archives, newspapers,
school yearbooks, clan association annuals, business directories, magazines,
periodicals and literary publications. With secondary research, I pieced these
fragments of information together, to create a more comprehensive and
historically framed network of human relations, and reconstruct Singapore’s
early art history.

#### **The Founders of the Society of Chinese Artists**

A group photograph (Figure 1) of SOCA’s founding members around
September or October 1935, shortly after the society had been registered and
their first meeting held, marks the beginning of this investigative journey.
According to the photo’s caption, the artists pictured are as follows: (from
right to left) Lee Kueh Sei, Tchang Ju-ch’i, Shu Chun Lien, Lu Heng,
Zhang Bohe, Lin Dao’an, Chen Chong Swee, Cai Zhuzhen, Nai Wen Chie,
Dai Yinlang, Chang Ming Tzu, Mrs Chang Ming Tzu, Chen Pu Chie, Kau
Chin Sheng and U-Chow.

SOCA was originally a smaller gathering of alumni from art schools in
Shanghai2 called the Syrens Art Association. They must have realised,
however, that limiting membership to Shanghai alumni was denying them
the critical mass needed for a lively art scene, and that there were many
more interested artists out there. Formed in early 1935, Syrens very quickly
opened up for wider membership by September and changed its name to
Society of Chinese Artists.

Thus the Shanghai alumni formed SOCA’s core. Tchang Ju-ch’i, Cai
Zhuzhen, Chen Chong Swee,3 Chen Pu Chie and Lee Kueh Sei were
graduates of Shanghai Art Academy, Shu Chun Lien of Xinhua Academy,
and Zhang Bohe of Shanghai University. Although it has yet to be
established if their periods of schooling coincided, we may infer that their
common Shanghai experience fostered a nucleus of shared interest that
brought them together while in Singapore. Here, they put their connection
to use, forming the art society to organise exhibitions and promote their art.

The society grew year by year, and by 1940 it was 40-strong. Four of its
members died during World War II, but SOCA bounced back after the war,
with 65 registered members in 1948.

#### **Same Path, Different Destinies**

Of the SOCA artists who were active in the prewar as well as preindependence
art scene, a handful are well documented and have been
canonised as pioneers of a unique Singapore-Malayan style, including Liu
Kang, Chen Chong Swee, Chen Wen-hsi, Cheong Soo Pieng, Lim Hak Tai
and Georgette Chen. This paper aims at filling in the gaps of our knowledge
about the other artists – those who were part of this critical mass setting
the Singapore art scene abuzz, but whose careers would take different turns,
particularly due to the war.

Many founding members would recede into the background, and some even
retreated from the scene. I have written about Tchang Ju-ch’i, Lu Heng and
Chen Pu Chie elsewhere,4 and my research did not yield much information
on Kau Chin Sheng5 and Nai Wen Chie.6 Although this paper does not offer an exhaustive account of the founding members, it reconstructs a fuller
picture of the scene.

**Lee Kueh Sei** (李魁士; c. 1902–71) was born in Jieyang, Chaozhou, and had
close links with the Teochews in Muar, Johor. A graduate of the Shanghai
Academy of Art and National Academy of Art (Hangzhou), Lee was a
favoured student of painter Liu Haisu (刘海粟). Lee was in Malaya possibly
as early as 1928, when he posed for a picture with a young Liu Kang (刘抗)
in Muar.7

Between 1932 and 1937, Lee taught at Chung Hwa in
Muar, and at Tao Nan School, The Chinese High School
and Tuan Mong School in Singapore, as well as the
Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA), mostly on a
part-time basis. By 1938, it seems Lee had left teaching and
started Khai Ming Bookstore (開明書店) with his friend
Lu Heng. Lee was active within the Teochew community
– he was one of the founders of the Kek Yeoh Association
in 1938 – and was also frequently mentioned in the Tao
Nan alumni association Nanlu Xueyouhui (南廬學友會)
and later in 1948 the Jinshi Shuhuashe (金石書畫社), a
society dedicated to classical painting, calligraphy, seal
carving and ancient inscriptions.

Lee painted in the Shanghai School style inherited from
masters such as Ren Bonian and Wu Changshuo and
perpetuated by the vibrant mercantilism of Shanghai
where Lee had his formal art education. Most of Lee’s
extant and published works show a strong preference
for dramatic composition, excellent brushwork and
flamboyant calligraphy – all characteristics cherished by
the Shanghai School (Figure 2). No cartoons or woodcuts
– in vogue in the 1930s – have been found in Lee’s oeuvre.

Lee gave a public talk on art in 1938 at the invitation of
the Kuo Yu Chinese Institution run by fellow SOCA
member Chang Ming Tzu, and also wrote a short review
of an exhibition of works by Wang Jiyuan, a professor of the Shanghai Art Academy.8 Both instances reveal Lee’s thoughts on art.
Obviously influenced by the education philosophy of Cai Yuanpei, father of
modern Chinese education, Lee believed that art had motivational power
and could nourish one’s spiritual life; it was a way of expressing one’s ideas
and emotions. However, at the height of Japanese aggression in China, Lee
thought art should serve the cause of patriotism by explicitly depicting mass
suffering to inspire people to rise up against oppression.

Lee was incarcerated by the Japanese army in 1942 shortly after Singapore
fell. After his release, Lee largely went by the name of Lee Ta Bai, perhaps
to evade persecutors. He remained active in social gatherings and taught
from time to time at NAFA, but it was said that his health had been badly
affected during his incarceration and he suffered various illnesses during
the 1960s. He passed away in September 1971 and was remembered in his
obituary as an artist and cultural personality.9

**Shu Chun Lien** (徐君濂 Xu Junlian; 1911–c. 2000) was a Shanghainese
who received his formal art training at Xinhua School of Art. Shu’s name
first appeared in Singapore Chinese dailies around August 1933, in an
announcement for the second Chinese trade fair held at Great World
Amusement Park. He is mentioned together with artists Tchang Ju-ch’i,
Lin Dao’an, Zhang Bohe and Huang Cheng Chuan (黃清泉).10 Around the
same time, Shu began working for *Sin Chew Jit Poh* (《星洲日報》) as an
editor and artistic director of its literary supplement and pictorial, which
Tchang and Lin also worked on.

Shu painted in a relatively academic realist style, as can be seen in the
two oil paintings he contributed to the SOCA exhibitions in 1939 (*Malay
Kampong*) and 1940 (*Landscape*) and published in the catalogues. His other
oil works of the prewar period were documented in Chinese newspaper
articles, but unfortunately without images.

Shu was probably more prolific in producing graphic and design works.
He was close to his colleagues at *Sin Chew Jit Poh*, some of whom started a
magazine dedicated to current affairs and contemporary literature called *Up
to Date* (《今代》). Shu wrote fictional pieces and drew satirical cartoons for
the magazine. An elaborate cartoon titled *Signs of a Decline* (没落的徵象)
can be found in the inaugural issue of May 1934 (Figure 3). Around the same
time, Shu started a short stint teaching art at The Chinese High School.

Shu’s other illustrations appeared in an essay on children’s health in a
pictorial published in February 1936 by the Nantao Publishing House
(南島出版社) owned by Phua Chay Long (潘醒農), and a map of Hainan
island commissioned by the Hainan Association for a war fundraising effort
in March 1939. He also produced a drawing for a stage layout when the
Nanyang Chinese Students Society (NCSS) created a performance space
and stage on their pre mises in 1934.11 In July 1941, Shu teamed up with his *Sin Chew* colleague Lin Dao’an to set up the Daying (“Big Eagle”) Art
Studio (大鹰画室), offering painting, drawing and signage production.12

Ink painting was also part of Shu’s repertoire. In 1974 and 1979, Shu – who
had returned to China for good around the early 1950s – presented his ink
paintings to Liu Kang and his wife, who were part of an official delegation
of Singapore artists on a historic visit to China, which had just reopened its
doors to the world. These paintings have been kept in the Liu Kang family
archive; one of them was exhibited in the Asian Civilisations Museum in
2019–20.13

Shu was also well known for his literary endeavours. In 1950, his novel and
short stories were published as *Rooftop Hotel* (《天台旅館》) and *Winter in
Dingjiaqiao* (《丁家橋之冬》) by *Nanyang Siang Pau* (《南洋商报》). He was
also active in both Peking opera and modern theatre, performing on radio
with the Ping She (平社) opera association and in various productions
presented by NCSS.

**Zhang Bohe** (張伯河; 1901–57) came from Puning, Chaozhou, and studied
in Shantou’s Zhendong Secondary School (震东中学), where his artistic
talent won him a scholarship to pursue art at the Shanghai Arts College
under Shanghai University. In 1926, he graduated with the first batch of the
Arts and Crafts class of its teachers’ training programme.

Not much else is known about Zhang’s life, but he left behind enough
works for his son to organise an exhibition and publish a catalogue of all
his works in 2005 in Singapore.14 This catalogue is a summary of Zhang’s
multifaceted talent – as a Chinese ink painter, sketcher, watercolourist,
designer, poet and art educator (as demonstrated by his essays on
teaching art).

Zhang’s teaching tenure at Tuan Mong School in Singapore gave him
a platform to express his artistic ideas. For example, he was the artistic
director for the school’s yearbook of 1931. His watercolour painting of the school building in Tank Road facing a wide field forms the establishing
shot of Tuan Mong at the start of the publication (Figure 4). He also
made drawings for chapter dividers and page backgrounds, and three
pencil sketches.15

**Lin Dao’an** (林道盫; 1908–42) was the younger brother of *Sin Chew Jit
Poh*’s manager, Lin Aimin (林靄民). A native of Fujian, the younger Lin was
a student of Liu Haisu (刘海粟) at the Shanghai Academy of Art. Before
becoming a picture editor at *Sin Chew* by 1934, Lin was based in Hong
Kong, producing advertising illustrations for a wide range of clients.

In 1936, he contributed two oil paintings for the inaugural SOCA
exhibition, but by 1937 he seemed to have retreated from active participation.
However, he continued to produce graphic and advertising works for *Sin
Chew* and its pictorial magazine *Starlight*, and *Up to Date* magazine. In the
7th SOCA exhibition, he was named as one of the SOCA martyrs who died
during the Sook Ching purge in early 1942, which suggests that he kept
close ties with the artists.

At present, no oil paintings by Lin have been located, but his graphic works
have been preserved in many publications and newspapers. In a colourful
advertisement created for *Sin Chew*, Lin’s striking lettering takes centre
stage, while a rooster, shoreline and coconut trees are silhouetted in blocks
of flat colour (Figure 5). His signature is executed with a hard-nibbed pen
instead of a brush, reflecting a general preference among
young intellectuals of that era for the convenience
of modern fountain pens, pencils or technical
writing implements.

In the inaugural issue of *Up to Date*, Lin contributed
three delightful cartoons featuring beautifully drawn
figures, titled *The Shape of an Elephant, Progress? Or
Digress?* and *Between the Two Sexes*. Here his signature
also reveals a playful humour as he drags out the
complicated radicals and strokes of the word 盫 to form a string-like scribble (Figure 6). In this issue, Lin also wrote a short
piece on his mentor, Liu Haisu.16

While in Singapore, Lin maintained ties with artists in Shanghai. In
September 1937 he was recruited to join *Jiuwang Manhua* (《救亡漫画》),
established by patriotic graphic artists in response to the outbreak of war
between Japan and China. The group included prominent cartoon artists
such as Ding Cong (丁聪), Zhang Guangyu (张光宇), Huang Miaozi
(黄苗子), Huang Yao (黄尧), Ye Qianyu (叶浅予) and Zhang Leping
(张乐平).

Lin’s Shanghainese connection also brought him close to Shu Chun Lien,
his fellow picture editor at *Sin Chew* as well as *Up to Date* contributor.
The two men set up Big Eagle Studio. Advertisements announcing the
establishment of the art studio were carried in both *Sin Chew* and *Nanyang
Siang Pau*, the former touting it as a new wave in the art world. The studio’s
vision statement – “The capital of a business is the advertising; art is the life
of the merchandise” – was said to have caused a stir in the business and art
community in Singapore.17

Lin’s high-profile career and dynamic partnership with Shu were cut short
when Lin died during the Sook Ching purge in February 1942, barely seven
months after the launch of Big Eagle Studio. He was only 35.18

**Cai Zhuzhen** (蔡竹貞; c. 1900–74) trained at the Shanghai Academy of Art
under Liu Haisu. He rarely exhibited his works in the years leading up to
the war in Singapore, though his participation was recorded in the 1936
exhibition and the iconic cartoon and photography exhibition in 1938, which
had entries by artists in the Malay Archipelago. A rare image of Cai’s work
can be found in the 1948 SOCA exhibition catalogue. It depicts an idyllic
scene of three Malays on a hilltop overlooking a vast expanse of sea and village (Figure 7). In Cai’s obituary, he was lauded as a pioneer in the art
world and a photographer in Singapore.19

**Dai Yinlang** (戴隱郎; 1907–85) was an enigma in the Singapore/Malaya art
world. Born in Kuala Lumpur, Dai found himself in Shanghai at a time
(1931–35) when left-wing socialism was taking hold in literature and the
visual arts. He most likely became an activist and joined the movement
spearheaded by Lu Xun to popularise woodcut prints and promote
social change.

Dai subsequently returned to Malaya and found work at *Nanyang Siang Pau*
as the editor of the cartoon supplement (《文漫界》). In 1934, Dai was briefly
in Hong Kong, where he started a woodcut society, the Deep Cut Woodcut
Society (深刻木刻研究會), and published a 7,000-word Social Realist
critique of symbolist poetry, which was then fashionable in China.20

Dai likely arrived in Singapore around the mid-1920s armed with a heavy
left-wing mandate directly from the Communist movement in China, and
he was widely respected for his political endeavours.

He tirelessly promoted the satirical cartoon as a vehicle for social and
political criticism and saw great historical importance in this new art
form.21 He played the role of mentor and critic to his fellow SOCA
artists. For instance, he wrote an extensive review of SOCA’s inaugural
exhibition in 1936, giving the artists individual critiques.22 His sharp-lined
cartoons with anti-Japanese and anti-Imperialist themes were the flavour
of the day in Singapore and Malaya, particularly at the height of Chinese
patriotism triggered by Japanese aggression in China from the summer of
1937 onwards.

Almost immediately after the Marco Polo Bridge incident, Dai organised
the first Singapore-Malayan Graphic Art Exhibition together with Shu
Chun Lien and a number of artists. Featuring some 185 works from 40
artists selected by a highly esteemed panel of artists,23 the spectacular
exhibition kicked off in Singapore in 1938 before proceeding on a tour of
the peninsula.

Dai is revered today in art-historical writings for his explicit and accessible
images of political righteousness, of China’s oppression by imperialism and
militarism. Unfortunately the second half of Dai’s life, presumably in China
right through the 1980s, has not been well studied.

**Chang Ming Tzu** (张明慈/张铭慈;24 c. 1898–1982) was the non-artist in
SOCA. A Yunnanese by birth and a graduate of Peking University, Chang
came with an illustrious political background, having participated in the
KMT-led National Revolution (国民革命; 1924–27), which brought him to
Shanghai, where he had his first encounter with Southeast Asia, or Nanyang
(南洋). He was part of the editorial team of the seminal journal dedicated
to Southeast Asia, *The Nanyang Monthly* (《南洋研究》), published by
Jinan University (暨南大学). Fluent in Japanese, Chang translated Japanese 
research and reports about Southeast Asia for the journal. His translation of *Nanyo Sodan* (《南洋叢谈》) by Fujiyama Raita25 was published by Jinan
in 1931.

In the mid-1930s, Chang set up the Kuo Yu Chinese Institution (中国语文
学院) at 38 Dhoby Ghaut, which was at various times neighbour to Huang
Pao-fang’s Mei Tong Art Studio at number 42, and Liu Kang’s Morrow
Studio at number 35.

Kuo Yu was part of the larger Chinese cultural scene; it actively organised
public lectures by visiting luminaries from China, as well as local speakers.
Lee Kueh Sei, for example, gave a talk titled “Art and Life” in 1938. During
the Japanese Occupation, the institution was renamed the East Asian
Japanese Language Institution (my translation; 东亚日本语学院).

In a seminar organised by *Syonan Asahi* (昭南日报; *The Syonan Daily*) to
commemorate the first anniversary of the fall of Singapore to Japan, Chang
was a speaker alongside Chong Beng Si (钟鸣世) of NAFA and Cupid
Art Studio (天使画室), and Goh Seng Yeok (吴盛育) of Mayfair Musical
and Dramatic Association (爱华音乐社), and spoke about the 21 Japanese
language schools that had sprung up on the island.26

Steeped in classical Chinese literature, Chang often shared his poetic skills
to lend literati credence to artists’ gatherings and works of a more traditional
style by the artists he socialised with. Chang’s collection of poems, *South Sea
Poems* (《南遊吟草》), offers a glimpse of the vibrant art scene of the period.

He wrote colophons and most probably personally inscribed works by
Tsai Wang Ching (蔡寰青), Wong Jai Ling (黄载灵), Xu Qigao (许奇高)
and Liu Kang.27 When gifted a painting by Xu Beihong (徐悲鸿), Chang
composed a poem to remember the occasion.28 To commemorate the visits
to Singapore by Luo Ming (罗铭) and Liu Haisu, both well-known Chinese
artists, Chang wrote long poems that could well double-up as surveys of
their exhibitions, because the titles and descriptions of the paintings were cleverly woven into the text.29 These literary details may be useful in future
identification of these artworks, should they be rediscovered.

Chang was a learned Buddhist scholar much admired in the Buddhist
community, and his poems are interesting records of visiting monks and
various Buddhist activities in Singapore.30

Over the years, Chang and his Kuo Yu Chinese Institution most probably
lent organisational support as well as political connections to the numerous
artistic and cultural activities taking place during this nascent period of
Singapore art. But the specifics of his involvement in the art scene remain
unclear. Further research would help to illuminate the role that intellectuals
like him played in artistic circles in prewar Singapore.

**U-Chow** (莊有釗; 1907–42) was the brother-in-law of Tchang Ju-ch’i, and
was generally known without his family name, Chuang/Zhuang or Chng
(莊). Sometime around 1932, he and Tchang became partners of a design
and commercial art company, United Painters Studio, operating out of a
shophouse at 82 Tank Road, which was also Tchang’s residence.

U-Chow presumably had a good command of English as he was designated
SOCA’s English secretary and press manager. It was very likely because of
U-Chow that SOCA’s exhibitions and general meetings were covered in the
prewar English dailies, such as the *Malaya Tribune* and *The Singapore Free
Press and Mercantile Advertiser.*

The most extensive description of U-Chow comes from a delayed obituary
written by Chuang U-Ming (莊右銘), which was featured in a special spread
in *Nanyang Siang Pau* dedicated to SOCA’s first postwar exhibition.31
U-Chow was described as self-taught in painting and languages – apparently
he taught himself German without setting foot in Europe.

U-Chow and Chuang were both born in Quanzhou and attended the same
class, where Chuang noticed U-Chow’s talent in drawing. This talent would
later be nurtured by an art teacher when U-Chow became a student at Raffles Institution in Singapore. A late bloomer, U-Chow graduated from
Raffles Institution at 23 and persisted in pursuing a career in art.

In 1931, together with Kau Chin Seng and Lin Chunyuan (林春元), U-Chow
won the contract for the construction and graphic design of Great World
Amusement Park. In 1933, U-Chow met Tchang; they became close friends,
business partners and then family when they married each other’s sister.

Chuang refuted the general opinion that U-Chow’s main source of artistic
influence had been Tchang, with an insight that could only have come
from being a close acquaintance. In fact, U-Chow preferred the purity and
originality found in African and Balinese art.

According to Chuang, U-Chow was also of the opinion that both Xu
Beihong and Liu Haisu, two titans of the Chinese Modernist movement
then, were unable to paint freely, because they were constrained by their
perceptions of their teachers’ styles. U-Chow’s criticism of Xu’s work
was specific and pointed – because Xu neglected the importance of
sketching and perspective, his figurative works and portraits were poorly
executed composites of fragments, resulting in awkward proportions and
lifeless subjects.

The *Nanyang Siang Pau* story featured two of U-Chow’s works, while
the SOCA exhibition catalogues of 1939 and 1940 carried some of his watercolours and sketches (Figure 8). One extant work can be found in the
collection of one of Chuang U-Ming’s descendants and was exhibited and
published by the Asian Civilisations Museum in 2019 in *Living with Ink: The
Collection of Dr Tan Tsze Chor*.32
