Artists express themselves in a variety of ways. Although art is the most obvious of these, some artists also rely on the medium of words as a means of self-expression. From private musings and working notes to published essays and interviews, many artists have chronicled their experiences, thoughts and feelings through the written and spoken word.

Some writings, like manifestos and declarations, tell us about the ideas behind a certain style or about the context in which artists worked, while others strike a deeper, more emotive chord. The Dutch post-impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh, for example, wrote 800 or so letters to his younger brother Theo, laying bare his private anguish and joys, and in the process painted a portrait of himself that is arguably as compelling as his artworks.

The celebrated Singaporean artist Georgette Chen (1906–93) also wrote extensively. Chen’s achievements as an artist are widely recognised: her lively oil paintings of the places and people of Singapore at a formative time in its history have cemented her status as one of the nation’s most important first-generation artists; she was also a respected art educator for 27 years and a Cultural Medallion recipient. Less well known, however, is her personal story, one that spans wars and revolutions, triumph and tragedy, and loves lost and found.

#### **A Life Less Ordinary**

“I often sit quietly in the silence of the night and wonder at the mysterious drama that is life…”1

Georgette Chen, who was named Zhang Liying when she was born in October 1906, was the fourth daughter of Zhang Jingjiang, a wealthy Chinese merchant. Growing up, Chen experienced a cosmopolitan and privileged upbringing in Paris, New York and Shanghai.

Chen’s father had encouraged her interest in art since young, even engaging a private art tutor, Victor Podgorsky, for her. Father and daughter, in fact, attended these lessons together. Chen’s affinity for oil as a medium was apparent even then.

She recalled of her childhood: “My father expected me to study Chinese painting, but I had a different idea. I told him I wanted to study the oil medium, which would enable me to paint everything around me, people, food, flowers, salted ducks, sampans, peasants and potatoes”.2 On another occasion, she remembered her father “impatiently enumerat[ing] the long list of Chinese vegetables which could be painted. He wanted to know why I insisted on painting the foreign potato”.3

Chen’s foundation in oil painting was further developed when she studied art in New York (1926–27) and then Paris (1927–33). Her time in the French capital was perhaps the most significant. The City of Light was not unfamiliar to Chen; having spent part of her childhood there, she spoke fluent French and was well acquainted with the sights and sounds of Paris. Chen counted the Tuileries Garden and Parc Monceau among her favourite childhood haunts and, decades later, would still delightfully recall riding on the merry-go-round at the park and feeding her favourite swans at the Tuileries.
