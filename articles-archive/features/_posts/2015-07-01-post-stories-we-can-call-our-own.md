#### **Han Fook Kwang** shares some of his favourite stories from Singaporeans as told in Living The Singapore Story, a book commemorating the nation’s golden jubilee.

What is the Singapore Story?

The answer is not straightforward  because different people will have different views of what story they most identify with this country. For some, it might be founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew’s memoirs. That story though is told from his point of view even if he had the advantage of being at the centre of many of the country’s most dramatic political events. What of the many other people who might have seen the story differently or have other stories to tell? Do their accounts matter and have a place in the nation’s storytelling?

When a group of us at <i>The Straits Times</i> were tasked with writing a book to com- memorate Singapore’s 50th anniversary, we spent much time debating this point.

How do you capture the story of this nation, its achievements and disappointments, the ups and downs, the personal  glories and tragedies that are part of any society’s history? How do you make sure the story is not one-dimensional but multi-colour and flavourful?

If we had told it the usual way, starting with the political battles with Malaysia, then separation, and the years of nation-building and economic development, we feared it  would be an overly familiar story. It would probably also have to be told from the top down, with the leadership taking the limelight.

We decided instead to do it through  the stories of ordinary Singaporeans who, through the lives they led and the things they did, told the Singapore story as much as the historical accounts.

It turned out to be a deeply satisfying project because we found a treasure trove of stories, which is not surprising because Singapore has been a very happening place these past 50 years. It is not a dull place which stays put.

In all, we found 58 storytellers from taxi driver to bus captain, teacher, satay  man, doctor, scientist, soldier, policeman, athlete, mountain climber, civil servants and many more.

Here are some of my favourites in the book, <i>Living The Singapore Story</i>, which was launched on 15 May 2015.

Kopitiam boss Lim Bee Huat started work cleaning tables at coffee shops for $1 a night. He was so poor he used to eat the food left by people at roadside offerings during the Hungry Ghost Festival. But he worked his way up, starting his first stall at the old Esplanade ground. Today, he owns more than 80 outlets and his staff get a Rolex watch from him when they have worked for more than 10 years.

There is a veteran unionist, Abdul  Rahman Mahbob, who, when he was just starting work in 1966 at the Pasir Panjang power station, saw his fellow workers going on strike for higher pay. He was not part of the strike then but he was so moved by their dedication and courage, he decided to join the union and rose to become president of the Union of Power and Gas Employees.  He has seen grown men cry when told they were being retrenched and he recounted  how he saved one worker by going directly to the big boss.

Another veteran – policeman Rahman Khan – was shot by Singapore’s most famous cop killer, Botak. But the assignment he remembers most vividly to this day was the gruesome body count he had to do after the Greek tanker Spyros exploded at Jurong  Shipyard, killing 76 workers.

Angel Ng was an angry young woman who was jailed eight times for various drug offences. When she last left her cell, she got a job at a call centre started by the prison authorities under its Yellow Ribbon project. Today, she manages three call centres.

Adam Maniam is a Tamil-Eurasian- Malay-Pakistani lawyer with a Catholic Tamil grandfather and a Eurasian grandmother. His father married a Muslim woman and converted to Islam. The lawyer married a Chinese girl and they decided on a civil marriage. It is a complicated story but very Singaporean.

There are also some not-so-ordinary people in the book.

Lee Khoon Choy was ambassador to Indonesia from 1970 to 1974. It was a tough assignment as Singapore had, in 1968,  hanged two Indonesian marines for planting a bomb at MacDonald House which killed three persons. Lee related how a man came to his house in Jakarta and threatened him over what Singapore did.

When Lee asked for a bodyguard, he was told bluntly by then Foreign Minister S. Rajaratnam: “We are a small country.  We cannot afford that.”

When J.Y. Pillay started Singapore  Airlines, he was told by the Government:  “Make it work and don’t come back to us for more money. You either survive on your own or fold up.” We know which option he chose.

These stories, whether of ordinary  people or well known ones, help us better understand the Singapore we call home.  Every nation must have these shared memories which the people can identify with and call their own.They strengthen the sense of belonging and identity, often more powerfully than physical landmarks or buildings.

Sometimes, these stories of the past provide comfort and satisfaction: See how far we’ve come! At other times, they give us greater confidence in the future: That’s how it was done before! Whatever they do to you, they are a precious part of who we are. This is especially important in Singapore which is changing so rapidly, making one generation so different from the next.

Many Singaporeans get upset when  old landmarks and places they remember fondly from their childhood are torn down or replaced by new structures. They feel a deep sense of loss to the emotional connection they have with the past. It’s the same with these stories.

If we do not find a way of recording  and remembering them, it will be like those forgotten buildings, lost forever.

#### **From Drug Offender  to Call Centre Manager**

<b>Angel Ng, 50, was in and out of jail  for drug offences between 1982 and  2008. She now manages three call  centres which hire ex-offenders.</b>

Being in and out of jail so many times  since  I  was  17  did  not  scare  me  off   prison  life.  Being  in  prison  was  no   big  deal;  some  prisoners  wanted  to   return to prison because they found  that better than having to face society.

n 1994, two weeks after I gave  birth to my only child, Valerie, I was  jailed  yet  again.  I’m  aggressive  and   argumentative by nature and I always  had the spirit of buay sai see (must not  die in Hokkien).

But  this  time,  I  had  post-natal   depression, missed my baby and was  worried about how my mother, who’d  just been told she had cervical cancer,  would cope with bringing up Valerie. I  thought: “I’ve been such a burden to my mother, and I can’t change. It’s best  to end it all.” I took a metal spike from  the toilet brush and cut my wrists...  The wardens saved me.

But  I  was  still  not  motivated   to change my ways. I just wanted to  damage myself completely because  I had a deep anger against the world  for being unwanted at birth. While in  prison, at the age of 33, I studied for  the O levels and scored five straight  A1s in subjects like English literature  and history.

In 2003, when I was 38 and had  started serving my longest-ever prison  sentence – 8½ years, later reduced to  six years – I began reading books on  religion and philosophy from the prison  library. Age was catching up with me.   I thought: “I can’t keep living like this.”

The following year, I learnt that  the prison authorities were starting  Southeast  Asia’s  first  prison  call   centre, as part of the Yellow Ribbon  Project that had just been set up to  help  ex-offenders  find  jobs  to  re-integrate  into  society.  I  wanted  to   work there because it was a white- collar job for which I had to use only  my voice, and not my appearance. So  I’d be able to work till I was very old.

I  was  released  from  my  last   prison term on 11 November 2008. A  week later, I began working at call cen- tre Connect Centre’s headquarters. It’s  been a big learning experience and it  has taken me to new places.

Most newly released ex-offend- ers have no money, so Connect gives  them $10 a day for meals until they get  their first month’s pay of about $1,000.  They need to stay focused by holding  a steady job because that disciplines  and stabilises them.

Angel Ng oversees more than 50  employees, many of them ex-offenders,   at Connect Centre. It trains former  inmates at its three call centres so they  have a chance at holding down steady jobs  and re-integrating into society.

#### **Made in Singapore:  Asia’s First Test-tube Bab**

<b>Despite his unusual beginnings,  Samuel Lee, 32, says he’s just an  average Singaporean.</b>

My friends used to tease me when we  were  children:  “You’re  man-made!”   I would laugh it off, but when I think  about it, they were right.

I  was  the  first  test-tube  baby   born  in  A sia  on  19  May  1983.  My   father was 21 and my mother 19 when  they  married  in  1976.  They  tried  to   conceive, but with no luck until 1982,  when they took part in a clinical trial  under  Professor  S.  S.  Ratnam  and   Professor Ng Soon Chye. Although  doctors implanted embryos in eight  women, I was the only success.

I  was  born  to  great  media   attention,  which  made  my  parents   uncomfortable.  We  were  ordinary   Singaporeans living in a three-room  flat  in  Woodlands.  My  father  was  a   security  supervisor  and  my  mother   a  secretary.  Thankfully,  the  in-vitro   fertilisation (IVF) was subsidised, and  thus affordable to them.

My birth might have been consid- ered extraordinary, but I was raised like  any ordinary Singaporean. I got my first  inkling that I was somehow different from other kids when I heard other  people referring to me as a test-tube  baby when I was four or five. I asked  my parents about it, and they just gave  me a simple explanation of how I came  about. I used to ask my parents for a  sibling. They’d laugh and tell me it was  a very difficult request to fulfil. It was  only when I was older – around 13 – that  I understood why and realised what my  birth really meant.

The late Prof Ratnam gave me  the name Samuel. I don’t know why.  We did not really stay in touch after  my birth. But I do e-mail and text Prof  Ng occasionally. Without them, there  wouldn’t have been me.

You could call me an advocate  of IVF. I often encourage my friends  who are trying to conceive to go for it.  I love kids and would definitely want  my own. But first, I have to find myself  a girlfriend.

#### **The Day He Faced a Cop Killer**

<b>Abd Rahman Khan Gulap Khan, 65,  spent 35 years in the police force –  most of them in the Criminal   Investigation Department.</b>

The worst pain I ever felt in my life was  on the night that I got shot. Not from the  bullet, but from the tetanus jab I had to  get later in the hospital. I couldn’t sleep  on my buttocks for three days.

I was shot by this guy we called  the “Cop Killer” in 1973. He shot and  killed a detective over a minor traffic  accident and the whole police force was  searching for him. The breakthrough  came from a robber who told us that  among  the  most  notorious  robbers   at  that  time,  the  one  most  likely  to   engage  with  police  was  this  man   known as Botak.

We  managed  to  trace  him  to   Cavenagh Road Apartments and used  a ruse to get him out. When he came  running out, a colleague put him in a headlock, but Botak had already pulled  out a gun. I grabbed hold of the gun, a  stolen police revolver, and he fired two  rounds which burned my palm. A third  shot grazed my stomach. We couldn’t  subdue  him,  so  my  colleague  shot   him twice in the arm, but Botak still  wouldn’t drop his weapon. Then other  colleagues rushed in, and one fired a  shot that I felt go past my ear, which hit  Botak in the head.

Then there was the disaster in  1978, when the Greek tanker Spyros  exploded at Jurong Shipyard. We spent  one solid week in the mortuary, which  had only a few refrigerated compart- ments in which to keep bodies. But we  had 76 bodies, and had to leave them  lying around on the floor to decompose. 

I  remember  we  were  eating   nasi  briyani  at  an  operating  table   with  bodies  on  the  floor.  We  had  to   take  our  food  there  as  we  couldn’t   leave, as we were waiting for people  to come in to identify the bodies, and  every hour the body changes because  of decomposition. After that, I had to  throw away all the clothes I was wearing,  including my undergarments, shoes,  everything, because it all stank. Even  a few days after we were done, when I  sat in the bus, people were still holding  their noses, because the smell sticks  to your skin. You bathe with Dettol, you  wash your hair, the stink is still there.

Veteran police officer Abd Rahman Khan  Gulap Khan was at the front line of several  major investigations.
