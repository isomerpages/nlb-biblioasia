description: Visiting Senior Research Fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian
  Studies Dr Arun Bala writes that recent studies have questioned the
  Eurocentric understanding of Singapore society and the science that drives it.
  These new approaches may be characterised as dialogical in contrast to
  traditional Eurocentric perspectives, suggesting that a confluence of
  different Eastern cultures, along with the Western tradition, gave birth to
  the Singapore and modern science that we know today.
