In a year when Singapore celebrated its 50th year of independence, the nation predictably looked back at its achievements and also cast an eye forward on its hopes and dreams. At the same time, the city also reached out to share its joy with friends from around the world. 

The National Library Board (NLB) – working in collaboration with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) – marked the nation’s Jubilee year in 2015 by presenting books on Singapore, or written by Singaporeans, to some 40 libraries across the globe.

The SG50 Gift of Books saw national and public libraries in countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, China, India, New Zealand and the United Kingdom receiving a total of 10,300 
books. Each library was given about 300 books, and in return, asked to display the titles for a month.

The books were carefully selected to cater 
to the reading habits and demands of diverse 
foreign audiences. The book lists differed for each 
library, depending on whether they were national 
or public libraries. It also took into account varying patron demographics as well as political and 
cultural sensitivities.
The book list that eventually made the final 
cut was based on feedback provided by experts 
as well as members of the Steering Committee 
for Read! Singapore, NLB’s annual nationwide 
reading festival. In addition, ministries and statutory boards were also approached to contribute 
books, with some 60 titles chosen from across 
their collections.
Singaporean leaders such as President 
Tony Tan Keng Yam, Deputy Prime Minister Teo 
Chee Hean and Minister for Communications and 
Information Dr Yaacob Ibrahim either witnessed 
or gifted the books in presentation ceremonies 
across the world.
“We thank all the libraries around the world 
who have received the SG50 Gift of Books and 
have made these books available to their patrons, 
who can use them to learn more about Singapore. 
Our deepest appreciation goes out to the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs, who helped us, through its 
overseas missions, with the book presentation 
ceremonies to the libraries and organisations,” said 
Mrs Elaine Ng, Chief Executive Officer, National 
Library Board.
