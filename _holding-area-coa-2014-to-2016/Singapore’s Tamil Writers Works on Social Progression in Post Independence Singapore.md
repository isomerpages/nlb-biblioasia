#### **Introduction**

As a Chinese adage goes, “the sparrow though small, has all five organs”.
Nothing could be truer than this for Tamil writing in Singapore – though
the number of Tamil literary works produced might be small compared
to other countries, Singapore’s Tamil literature is complete in its various
aspects such as heritage, genres and aesthetics. Long before Tamil writing
arrived on today’s postmodern landscape, creative migrant voices were
already heard from Singapore and drew inspiration from well-known writers
from back home in India.

The first collection of poetry from Singapore as well as the region written
in Tamil, *Munajattut Tirattu*, was printed at J. Paton Government Printer
in Singapore in 1872.[^1] *Singai Vartamani*, the first Tamil newspaper in the
Malay Peninsula, appeared in Singapore in 1875.[^2] The first anthology of
Tamil short stories, *Navarasa Katha Manjari*, was published in Singapore
in 1930.[^3] Singapore was the first in the world to launch, on the Internet, an anthology of poems in all four official languages, called Poemnet. In
October 1995, then-president of Singapore Ong Teng Cheong launched the
anthology *Journey: Words, Home and Nation – Anthology of Singapore Poetry
(1984–1995)* on Poemnet.[^4]

Tamil writing in Singapore also portrays changing social realities. “Kudirai
Pandhya Lavani”, a 1893 folk-style poem about horse racing in the country,
describes lively street scenes. After Singapore became independent in 1965,
the Singapore literati grew sensitive to new realities, which was reflected in
their works of that time.

Tamils in Singapore are in the paradoxical position of being the majority
in the Indian community, but yet are a minority of the four races in
the country – this, however, is seldom reflected in their writings. The
journey of Tamil writing in Singapore is akin to travelling on a train in
broad daylight, passing by a variety of landscapes, people and postures.
Similarly, post-independence, literary writing in Tamil has met with starts
and stops. It eventually found its way in the 1970s, settled on its pace in
the 1980s and picked up swift momentum from the 1990s.

For this paper, I have restricted my study to fiction and poetry in Singapore
Tamil literature written between 1965 and 2015. The authors mentioned in
this paper have won coveted literary awards in Singapore and abroad. The
original quotes in Tamil have been listed in Appendix I.

#### **Becoming an Independent Nation**
Unlike many countries in Asia that fought bitterly for independence,
Singapore became a republic like a “bolt from blue”[^5] on 9 August 1965. The
country remembers the historic press conference during which founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew was in tears as he announced Singapore’s
separation from the Federation of Malaysia.

For the fledgling government, the challenges for a country with no
natural resources involved many pressing “bread and butter” issues,
including developing a robust economy and building a strong armed
forces. The determined work and far-sighted intelligence of the founding
cabinet brought about considerable improvements in the lives of many
Singaporeans. According to well-known sociologist Dr A. Veeramani, the
three major initiatives that transformed the lives of Singaporeans were
“housing, education and the rapid pace of economic growth”.[^6]

At first, the local media and communities believed that the separation was
merely a miscommunication and that Singapore would eventually re-join
Malaysia.[^7] Later, as reality sank in, poets produced works praising Singapore
and its leadership.

K. Perumal produced 133 songs and poems about the new nation in
*Singapore Padalkal (Hymns on Singapore)*.[^8] In the book’s preface, V.T. Arasu
says, “Out and out all the songs are on Singapore. Yet the poet has not
drowned the songs on the description of the landscape and in exaggeration.

On the contrary, he points out the basic values of Singapore.”[^9]
Paranan, a 1986 S.E.A. Write Award winner, devoted 19 out of 100 poems to
praising the republic in his collection *Thoni (Boat)*.[^10]

National Day has been particularly inspiring for poets. During the country’s
10th anniversary, 1986 Cultural Medallion winner Na. Palanivelu wrote a
eulogy, “Kadamai” (“Duty”):

   *Ten years of independent rule<br> 
   Has made us undeniably world renowned<br> 
   Small pearl like clusters of islands fronting it<br> 
   Our Singapore emerges like a diamond radiating in all directions<br> 
   Telling for the splendour and affluence of the land<br> 
   Let us put our earnest resolve to prosper further<br> 
   This is our duty*[^11]

Poet Naa. Aandeappan describes Singapore as a “classy diamond / in the
saline sea” in “Uyarthara Vairam” (“Classy Diamond”).[^12] In a similar
fashion, poet Pichinikkadu Elango symbolises “Singapore as golden plate
floating in deep sea” in his work “August 9”.[^13]

#### **From Kampong to HDB**
As Singapore underwent rapid urbanisation, several hundred *kampong*
(village) houses were transformed into high-rise apartments. By 1962, in
just two years, the Housing Board (HD B) had built 26,168 flats, almost
equalling the number of units its predecessor, the Singapore Improvement
Trust (SIT ), built in 32 years. By the end of 1965, its tally exceeded 50,000
units.[^14] In only nine years, some 150,000 people had been resettled.[^15]

For many Singaporeans, the relocation from rickety attap houses with no
electricity to concrete blocks with tiled floors was a journey from a primitive
past to a promising future; from aggravation to advantage; and from misery
to modernity.

Mayandiambalam Balakrishnan (Singai. Ma. Elangkannan), the first Tamil
writer to receive the S.E.A. Write Award in 1982, depicts the excitement of
arriving at a new flat:

   *Getting down from the taxi, Velu and Ezhilarsi looked up at the highrise<br>
   building. “Do you see a sari drying on the cloth line? At the 10th<br>
   floor? That is our house. Maragatham also got a flat close to us,” said<br>
   Muthammal, walking towards the elevator. The flat looked nice. Floors<br>
   were paved with tiles. The kitchen looked clean and neat. Peeping into<br>
   the kitchen, Velu expressed his surprise, “Is this our kitchen?”* [^16]
	 
Like Velu in Elangkannan’s story, many Tamil poets were excited about
the new high-rise apartments, which softened the pains of relocation.
Na. Palanivelu, recipient of the Cultural Medallion, claimed in his poems
that the old miseries had vanished like a dream when he moved into his
HD B flat.[^17] K.T.M. Iqbal, an eminent poet and recipient of both the S.E.A.
Write Award and Cultural Medallion, was fascinated by the cloud-kissing
skyscrapers.[^18] Paranan, another veteran poet, seemed even more awestruck
by tall residential flats that blocked the sun.[^19]

C. Kumarasami, a veteran Tamil activist, describes the misery of living in
cramped quarters in “Life in Pasir Panjang”:


   *Crowded in a small space, people lived in huts in kampongs. Most<br>
   of the huts were single-room accommodations, and in many of them,<br>
   there were no kitchens. One had to cook, eat and sleep in that small<br>
   room. And there were no cots to sleep in. Every family had four or five<br>
   children. Like seeds arranged in a pod, all of them slept next to each<br>
   other. Yet efforts for procreating another child was also initiated in<br>
   that milieu*.[^20]

Perhaps more importantly, there was less fear. The *kampongs* were rife with
gangsters, whom landlords often hired to evict tenants. Former Member
of Parliament Pathmanaban Selvadurai recounts an experience in *Bukit
Panjang: From Kampong to Town*:

I had a representative from this company – he saw me in my
branch and said, “We will help you in getting rid of the Barisan
Sosialis (an opposition political party) because all these squatters
were Barisan Sosialis supporters. If [we support them] they [will]
send in their gangsters and employ strong-arm tactics.” I had to
tell them: “Well, look, thank you very much, we are a government
party, we can’t indulge in that kind of activities. But if you give
these fellows a fair deal in terms of compensation, I will assist you,
fellows, to get [the squatters] out.” [^21]

Noorjahan Sulaiman also mentions the gangsters in her novel *Vergal* (*Roots*):
“In those days there were gangsters in *kampongs*, almost in every street.”[^22]

However, high-rise living placed new pressures on the pocket. In the
radio drama series *Aduku Veetu Annasami* (*Annasami and his Apartment*),
broadcast weekly for 52 weeks, Cultural Medallion recipient Pudumaithasan
(P. Krishnan) expressed the pinch on the wallet:

   *Santhammal: Did you notice how comfortable this house is? There is<br>
   a hall, a bathroom and kitchen. We lived in a kampong. You were<br>
   so adamant to stay there. But, now look at this place. Nice, isn’t it?*<br>

   *Arockiasamy: What was the rent you were paying there? Do you<br>
   remember? It was 15 dollars. And the rent here? 46.5 dollars. If you<br>
   add water and electricity charges, it would easily exceed 55 dollars*.<br>

   *Santhammal: This being an HDB flat, the rent is limited to 46.5<br>
   dollars. Go and check what the rent would have been had this<br>
   been a private flat; the rent would have been 80 or 100 dollars*.<br>

   *Arockiasami: Should comfort cost that much? Can’t that be made<br>
   available for 15 dollars?*[^23] 
	 
There were other challenges, too. For many Singaporeans, the transition to
high-rise living caused much distress. Everyone had to grapple with losing the
kinship formed with their former neighbours. All had to get used to living
among strangers of different races. Some were afraid of lifts and resorted to
taking the stairs. Others sorely missed rearing livestock and poultry.

Kanagalatha, who writes under the pseudonym Latha, expressed the
anguish of the loss of comradeship due to relocation through one of her
characters in the short fiction piece, *Veedu* (*Home*):

   *We were moving with each other like sisters, but the relocation<br>
   threw us apart to different directions. Having been accustomed to<br>
   living close to the ground and next to trees, I found high-rise living<br>
   challenging. It was living as if confined to four walls and was<br>
   suffocating. I couldn’t sleep and it took a long time for me to adjust<br>
   to the new surroundings*.[^24]

Mayandiambalam Balakrishnan (Singai. Ma. Elangkannan) painted a
poignant picture of parting with cattle in his novel *Ninaivukalin Kolangal*
(*Designs of Memories*):

   *Those standing in the truck pulled the cow by the rope in its nose.<br> 
   Refusing to walk in, the cow pulled them back. A person standing<br> 
   behind the cow twisted its tail to nudge it forward. The cow, still<br> 
   resisting, plodded into the truck. It shivered in fear and shat.<br> 
   Thrusting its neck forward, it cried helplessly, “Moo!” Tears appeared<br> 
   in the eyes of Maragatham, who was watching its plight. It appeared<br> 
   to her as if the cow were crying Amma [mother] towards her. She<br>
   turned aside. And there stood the cow with black spotted skin. It had<br> 
   become barren now. Her husband Murugaiya used to often say, “We<br> 
   became better off with her. Let us not sell it. Let her die here.” Her<br> 
   husband’s words passed through her mind. Tears rolled down her<br> 
   cheeks. Unable to bear the sight she rushed in*.[^25]
	 
#### **National Service**
After Singapore became independent and British troops withdrew from the
region, government leaders were forced to re-think their defence strategy.
Initially, a part-time reservist force, the People’s Defence Force, with 3,200
volunteers was formed. However, Minister for Interior and Defence Goh
Keng Swee realised that with Singapore’s population being at less than two
million, it was impossible to form and maintain a large regular army like
those in neighbouring countries.[^26] Thus he proposed a citizens’ army and the
National Service Act was passed in July 1967.

For the conscripted, enlistment evoked two emotions: pride and sadness.
S. Rajaratnam wrote, “When young Chinese, Malays, Indians and
Eurasians train together to defend and die for their country, then they
become true blood brothers.”[^27] On the other hand, being away from family
would cause sadness; according to a Mr Lee, “[s]oldiers and uniforms of any
type used to have unhappy memories for us”.[^28]

Rama Kannapiran, a 1990 S.E.A. Write Award winner, expressed both these
sentiments in his story “Tanah Merah Diary”.[^29] Kannapiran’s contemporary,
Se. Ve. Shanmugam, said of the book: 

   *Amot, the drill master, a benevolent man under the guise of a strict<br>
   disciplinarian, touches our heart, relegating the main characters to<br>
   the background, in Tanah Merah Diary. If a character, which is<br>
   minor and appears for a fraction of a second in a story, can move<br>
   us, then it is a testament to the skill of the author*.[^30]<br>
	 
#### **Educational Policies**
***Bilingualism***
During their colonial rule, the British government allowed Singapore’s
various ethnic communities to educate their children in their respective
mother tongue languages. After Independence, the Singapore government
saw the potential of the English language for both building the economy
and uniting the different ethnic groups. Hence a bilingual model was
embraced, with English as the medium of instruction in schools and the
official mother tongue of the students taught as a second language.

Tamil schools in Singapore, mostly founded by the working class and
through public contributions, served a two-fold purpose: educating its
members in their mother tongue and establishing their identity.[^31] When the
bilingual policy was implemented, many Tamil parents felt that an Englishmedium
education would pave the way for better career opportunities and
enrolled their children in English schools. This change resulted in the quick
demise of Tamil schools.

Eminent poet Paranan strongly advocated the move towards bilingualism in
his poem “Iru Vizhigal” (“Two Eyes”):

   *Only when our Tamil children<br> 
   Learn Tamil, the mother tongue<br> 
   And English, the global tongue<br> 
   Their future will flourish<br> 
   Hence<br> 
   Beloved parents<br> 
   I plead with you<br> 
   With folded hands<br> 
   To let your children<br> 
   Learn Tamil and English* [^32]<br> 

Interestingly, Rama Kannapiran, an English teacher speaking about his
apprehension about the future of Tamil as a home language, categorised the
Tamil community into three groups: those who spoke only Tamil, those
who spoke only English and those who spoke a mix of both languages.
One of the characters in his novella *Vazhvu* (*Life*) expresses anxiety about
the third group, whose members, described as being in a transitional phase,
could neglect their mother tongue language.[^33]

Kannapiran’s fears about Tamil speakers losing their ability to speak their
mother tongue may have come true.[^34]

<div style="background-color: white;">Proportion who spoke english most Frequently at home
among resident population aged 5 years and over by ethnic group
and age group</div>

According to the
2010 Census of Population:

   *Concurrent with the rise in the level of English literacy, the usage<br>
   of English at home became more prevalent. Correspondingly, the<br>
   use of Malay and Tamil as a home language was less prevalent<br>
   among the Malays and Indians respectively in 2010 compared<br>
   to 2000*.[^35]

***Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE)***

First implemented between 2 and 4 November 1960,[^36] the PSLE national
examination system was revised in 1992, when a review committee proposed
ways to improve Singapore’s education system.[^37]

Under the new scheme, the PSLE would measure students by the T-Score
Aggregate, which would show how well a student had performed in his four subjects relative to other students in the same cohort.[^38] The T-Score
Aggregate is the first criterion that impacts admission to secondary schools
of the students’ choice.

The meritocracy-based system has caused many parents to fear that
their children would fall behind. Writer Azhagunila captures both the
children’s stress and parents’ anxiety in her short story “Aranju” (“six
five”):[^39]

   *Mom has banned me from computer games, cartoons, PSP and<br> 
   soccer – all with the same excuse of Primary Five! Primary Six!<br> 
   On days without school, dad used to go out with me and Rahul.<br> 
   Now he doesn’t bring me anywhere. The numbers five and six<br> 
   make me feel sick. I’ d love it if someone could tell me the secret to<br> 
   joining secondary school without having to sit for the PSLE*.

On 13 July 2016, the Ministry of Education announced changes to the PSLE
scoring system: the aggregate score for the PSLE would be replaced with
wider scoring bands from 2021.[^40] However, debates on PSLE are unlikely to
cease in the near future.

#### **Women and Marriage**

Singapore ranked among the top 15 (out of 155) countries in the 2014 United
Nations Human Development Index (HDI ); it was the top Asian country
for gender equality.[^41] Modern Singapore women enjoy similar access to
education and employment as men. The employment rate for women was at one of its highest levels: 76 percent for the prime working ages of 25 to 54.[^42]
Girls also outnumbered boys in higher education.

<img src="/images/COA%202014%20to%202016/Tamil%20Writers%20Works/Capture1.jpg" style="width:100%;">
<div style="background-color: white;">Level of Education by Gender. <i>Census of Population 2010 / Singapore Department of Statistics (2010)</i></div>

As educated career persons, women increasingly prefer to remain single,
delay marriage or seek a divorce.[^43]

In the Indian community, less than 1 percent of women below the age of 20
entered into matrimony in 2015, compared to more than 50 percent in the
1980s. Currently, more than 50 percent of women prefer to marry after the
age of 30.[^44]

<img src="/images/COA%202014%20to%202016/Tamil%20Writers%20Works/Capture2.jpg" style="width:100%;">
<div style="background-color: white;">Age of Women at the Time of Marriage (%). 2015 figures are based on statistics on marriages and divorces.
<i>Singapore Department of Statistics (2015) Statistics on Marriages and Divorces.
Retrieved from singstat.gov.sg</i></div>

The *Census of Population 2010* confirms the trends of delayed marriages and
higher divorce rates:

   *The proportion of singles among the resident population rose<br>
   from 30 percent in 2000 to 32 percent in 2010. This reflected the<br>
   postponement in marriages and greater tendency for individuals<br>
   to remain unmarried. The proportion who were either divorced or<br>
   separated increased from 2.5 percent in 2000 to 3.3 percent in 2010*.<br>[^45]
	 
   *[…] The increase in the proportion of singles between 2000 and<br>
   2010 was more prominent for the younger age groups. Among<br>
   Singapore citizens aged 30–34 years, the proportion of singles rose<br>
   significantly from 33 percent to 43 percent for the males, and from<br>
   22 percent to 31 percent for the females*.[^46]

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, writers discussed the issues of marriage as
an institution that denies self-esteem, identity and freedom to women, as
well as the modern woman’s increasing assertiveness.

Elangovan, a 1997 S.E.A. Write Award winner, illustrates the loss of identity
in a father’s tale to his daughter, Nisha, in the play *Talaq* (*Divorce*):

   *There was a beautiful salt doll. It did not know what it was. So it<br>
   journeyed for thousands of miles over land until it finally came to<br>
   the sea. It was fascinated by this strange moving mass, quite unlike<br>
   anything it had ever seen before. It kept watching the huge waves*.<br>

   *Hey, who are you? Said the salt doll to the sea*.<br>

   *The sea smilingly replied, come and see. You will find out. So the<br>
   doll waded into the sea bravely. The farther it walked into the sea<br>
   the more it dissolved, until there was only its mouth left. Before<br>
   that bit dissolved, the salt doll smiled peacefully and exclaimed in<br>
   wonder, “Now I know what I am.” It disappeared without a name<br>
   among the waves as a wave*.<br>

   *Nisha, you are like that salt doll. The bridegroom who has<br>
   come from Singapore to marry you is the sea. Henceforth, he is<br>
   everything to you*.[^47]

In the short story *Amaipu* (*System*) by Naa. Govindasamy, another S.E.A.
Write Award winner (1994), the female protagonist expresses her anguish
over the loss of freedom in marriage:

   <i>I believe woman loses her individuality and freedom when she<br> 
   enters into wedlock with a man. In this male-dominated society,<br> 
   women have been used as objects of pleasure for many centuries.<br> 
   Men have used women for their selfish ends. The marriage laws<br> 
   that are in vogue, are also drafted in men’s interests. Woman will<br> 
    be emancipated unless the system changes.</i> [^48]

Singapore literary pioneer Se. Ve. Shanmugam advises women to rely on
themselves in order to live honourably and freely, and to think carefully
before entering into matrimony.[^49]

However, there are some women who, not receiving respect and freedom,
opt to leave the marriage, even if it means raising their children by
themselves. Suriya Rethnna, a recipient of the Mont Blanc Young Writers’
Fellowship in 1998 and the 2014 Karikalan Award of Tamil University
(Thanjavur, India), describes the pride and plight of a single mother in the
moving story  <i>Iraivanin Kuzhanthai </i> ( <i>God’s Own Child </i>).[^50]

In his award-winning story,  <i>Kolangal </i> ( <i>Designs </i>), Seetha Lakshmi brings
out the flip side of divorce: the loneliness of a man in search of a soulmate
after two failed marriages. The story is told from the unique angle of
a father seeking permission from his adolescent son to remarry and
reinforces the inevitable role of family and unavoidable divorce, a paradox
of modern society.[^51]

Shaanavas, whose short story collection, <i>Moontravathu Kai</i> (<i>Third Arm</i>), won
the Singapore Literary Prize in 2014, believes that the lack of understanding,
more than lack of love, is the cause of failed marriages; he addresses this in
his story “Pesa Mozhi” (“Unspoken Language”).[^52]

#### **Economic Growth**

American businessman and politician Mitt Romney once said,
“Dependency is death to initiative, risk-taking and opportunity.”
Singapore has exemplified this as seen by its astounding economic
growth over the last 50 years, which were in part due to two strategic
decisions made soon after independence, though unconventional at the
time: to shift away from import-substitution in favour of export-led
industrialisation, and to attract global multinational corporations as
vehicles to achieve industrial growth.

In 1965, Singapore’s nominal GDP per capita was about US $500, similar to
that of Mexico and South Africa. In 1990, its GDP per capita rose to about US $13,000, surpassing South Korea, Israel and Portugal. In 2015, the GDP
per capita was about US $56,000, similar to Germany and the United States.[^53]

Singapore’s extraordinary journey from third world to first is reflected
in literary works such as Pon. Sundarasau’s short story “Ippadiyum oru
Pizhaippu” (“A Livelihood of a Kind”) in the collection <i>Ennathan Seyvathu</i>
(<i>What to Do?</i>).[^54]

On the other hand, the Singapore economy was buffeted by serious crises
between 1974 and 2008, such as the 1974 international oil crisis, 1987
Singapore economic recession, the financial crises of 1998 and 2008, and
2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS ).

In his short story <i>Oyvu</i> (<i>Retirement</i>), S.E.A. Write Award winner P. Krishnan depicts the plight of a middle-class worker who loses his CPF
savings, and subsequently his life, as a result of the stock market crash.[^55]

#### **SARS**
The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS ) in Singapore
in February 2003 adversely impacted the economy and caused widespread
fear among Singapore residents. Many hospital staff bore the brunt of
the paranoia.

In <i>The Straits Times</i> report “They were shunned for treating Sars patients”,
published one decade after the outbreak, Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH )
staff members Rose Herdawati, Siva Sevakame and Vasanthi Palanivelu
recounted their experiences during the period:

   <i>“Whenever the train reached Novena, it would become passenger-<br>
   free,”
remembered Ms Sevakame. “We would take showers and<br> 
   change before going back, but somehow they’ d know we were<br> 
   nurses and start moving away. So I didn’t have to worry about not<br> 
   getting a place to sit,” she added with a laugh.</i>

   <i>[…] The prejudice was not just from strangers, but from<br> 
   neighbours and family too. Ms Herdawati remembered how<br> 
   neighbours who used to exchange cooked food with her mother<br> 
   stopped doing so. Ms Sevakame was then renting a room in an<br> 
   Yishun flat that, with her husband, they shared with her landlady<br>
   and the landlady’s three teenage children. When her landlady got<br> 
   wind that Ms Sevakame might have contracted SARS, she tried to<br> 
   evict the couple.</i>[^56]
	
In her story “Mukhangal” (“Faces”), written in 2003 itself, writer Jayanthi
Sankar captured the negative social aspects mentioned in <i>The Straits Times</i>
report – the avoidance by neighbours, neglect by the public and threat of
eviction. The story stands as a testament to human behaviour during a lifethreatening
epidemic.[^57]

#### **Conclusion**
Tamil writers in Singapore may have initially drawn inspiration and
modelled their writing styles after Indian pioneer writers originating from
Tamil Nadu, India, but Tamil writing in Singapore is different in many
crucial ways.

Indian writing, which has a long history, was first nurtured by mainstream
media and then through writing competitions organised by magazines. The
writers who pioneered the early literary moments in India were exposed
to European and Russian literature as well as works from Latin America.
This enabled them to root their works within well-tailored forms and in
different genres.

However, publishing opportunities for Singapore Tamil writers have been
very limited, and there has been little room for avant-garde or experimental work. The pioneering Tamil writers, deprived of the rich literary exposure
of their Indian counterparts, wrote out of their passion for language and
literature, and in response to changing social situations in Singapore.

In this study, I have focused on Singapore Tamil writers and how
their works have reflected the social transformations from Singapore’s
independence to 2015. I have not performed a qualitative assessment of the
works as that is out of the purview of this paper.

In conclusion, I have found that while Singapore Tamil writers have
been responding to the various changes in the country in the last 50
years and reflecting the voices of their community, they have not done
so with conviction. While they have voiced their concerns about the
social and economic transformations, they have done so only within the
narrow framework of their home or neighbourhood. None of the writers
have initiated any literary movements through their works, and political
discourse has been rare. Further, more can be done to nurture, develop and
encourage young readers and writers. (See Appendix III for suggestions for
nurturing young readers.)

#### **APPENDIX III**
***Encouraging Young Readers to Read Tamil Works and Develop New Content***

In this present age of social media and instant gratification, encouraging
young people to read is of utmost concern to education professionals and
parents worldwide. In Singapore, as English is the medium of instruction
in schools and commonly spoken in households, it has been challenging to
encourage young and adolescent readers to read Tamil literary works.

Singapore has mitigated this challenge to some extent by digitising most
of the works published in the past 50 years. Thus, this computer-savvy
generation can easily access these books on their mobile devices.

However, the greater part of the problem is not access to books, but in the
youths’ ability to relate to the themes and content of the works. These young
people feel that the issues they are most concerned about, such as admission
to higher education, career growth, parental and teacher authority, and
romantic relationships, are not reflected in these works.

Solutions must emerge from both the community and individual.

***Cultivating the Reader***

Reading is a matter of habit and matures over time. Thus, the seed of love
for reading should be sown at an early age. Here are some suggestions for
doing so:

Leisure reading must be differentiated from classroom reading. The former
is reading for pleasure, while the latter is an academic exercise. Hence, if
students are asked to read a storybook in a classroom setting, it may detract
from the pleasure of the activity and eventually distance the student from
reading altogether. In order to cultivate the reading habit, teachers could
organise storytelling sessions in a way that the story is partially revealed to
arouse curiosity and students then encouraged to visit the library to discover
the rest of the tale from the book.

“Literature” should not be pushed down students’ throats. Thrillers and
fantasies, or even romantic stories, such as Mills &amp; Boon novels, may be the
best starting points for emerging readers. Once “hooked”, these readers can
be encouraged to look for other, more “serious” titles.

Book clubs in schools or at libraries can also be set up. Students can
meet once a fortnight to participate in simple reading sessions and lively
discussions about the stories. The selected story need not be a “classic”
and there should be no lectures about its literary “worthiness”. Along
with so-called proper books, “trashy” works may also be permitted so that
students can learn to discern the difference in writing quality.

Reading should also be incentivised. Schools could consider setting up a
Facebook page or Instagram account to share good reads through pictures
and short reviews. Such books may also be mentioned at reading festivals or
on National Reading Day. At present, these festivals celebrate the writers,
but they should celebrate the readers as well. Schools may also consider
holding their reading events in conjunction with institutions such as the
National Library Board, National Book Development Council of Singapore
(NBDCS), as well as other schools.

***Grooming the Writer***

Some say writers are born, not created. However, writing skills may be honed
through mentoring and peer review. A mentor does not need to be a “popular”
writer or one with many accolades. In my opinion, inviting celebrated writers
just to conduct one-day or two-hour workshops is not as useful in the long
run as a dedicated mentor, even online, who can gently but firmly guide the
mentee in tightening their writing and cultivating a personal style.

Sensitising the budding writer to the issues around him – cultural, social,
familial, political – is important, as they are fodder for thought and may
become triggers for writing. This aim can be achieved in group discussions,
debates and other learning sessions.

While some writers write for financial gain, others do so for recognition,
such as in the form of awards and publishing contracts. In Singapore,
opportunities for print publishing in Tamil are limited. Writers can explore
publishing their works in online journals, which has the potential for greater
reach at lower cost.
