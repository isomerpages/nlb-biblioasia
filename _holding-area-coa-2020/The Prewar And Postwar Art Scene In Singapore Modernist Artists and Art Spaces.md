#### **Introduction**
In September 1935, a group of immigrant Chinese artists established the
Society of Chinese Artists (SOCA; 中華美術研究會), or Société des artistes
Chinois, in Singapore. These Modernist artists were distinct from the
preceding generation of artists, who were mostly born in the 19th century
and schooled in the classics under the tutelage of traditional scholars, and
whose works were produced in the traditional mode.

In this paper, I examine the prewar and postwar (late 1920s–early 1950s) art
scene in Singapore: the life and work of the active but lesser-known SOCA
Modernist founders, the relationships among them, the prevalent styles of
their work, the historical and social circumstances that shaped their art, and
the art spaces they used. Although these artists are neither well documented
nor canonised, they were part of the vibrant prewar and postwar art scene.
My study reveals a microcosm of artistic germination and rich human
dynamics in the prewar and postwar art scene and fills the gaps in our
knowledge of early Singapore art history.

The art scene from the turn of the 20th century up to the eve of Singapore’s
independence has been analysed by Yeo Mang Thong as consisting of four
strands of development:1

  1.  the period between the late 19th and early 20th centuries, centring<br> 
    around individuals of cultural influence, such as Khoo Seok Wan, his<br> 
    literary circle and the sojourning scholars who offered their literati<br> 
    skills (calligraphy and painting) to the Chinese mercantile community;

  2. the period corresponding to the Chinese Republican years, which saw<br> 
    the rise of graphic art (woodcut prints and cartoons) as a new form of<br> 
    social expression, and a group of Modernist artists in exile from China,<br> 
    mostly members of SOCA;

  3. Singapore under the Japanese Occupation (1942–45); and

  4. unique artistic personalities, namely Tchang Ju-ch’i, Situ Qiao, both<br>
    prominent patriotic artists of the prewar period, and Austrian sculptor<br>
    Karl Duldig, who lived and worked in Singapore in 1939–40.

The present study focuses on the second strand of development, drawing on
a wide range of materials, including public and private archives, newspapers,
school yearbooks, clan association annuals, business directories, magazines,
periodicals and literary publications. With secondary research, I pieced these
fragments of information together, to create a more comprehensive and
historically framed network of human relations, and reconstruct Singapore’s
early art history.

#### **The Founders of the Society of Chinese Artists**

A group photograph (Figure 1) of SOCA’s founding members around
September or October 1935, shortly after the society had been registered and
their first meeting held, marks the beginning of this investigative journey.
According to the photo’s caption, the artists pictured are as follows: (from
right to left) Lee Kueh Sei, Tchang Ju-ch’i, Shu Chun Lien, Lu Heng,
Zhang Bohe, Lin Dao’an, Chen Chong Swee, Cai Zhuzhen, Nai Wen Chie,
Dai Yinlang, Chang Ming Tzu, Mrs Chang Ming Tzu, Chen Pu Chie, Kau
Chin Sheng and U-Chow.

SOCA was originally a smaller gathering of alumni from art schools in
Shanghai2 called the Syrens Art Association. They must have realised,
however, that limiting membership to Shanghai alumni was denying them
the critical mass needed for a lively art scene, and that there were many
more interested artists out there. Formed in early 1935, Syrens very quickly
opened up for wider membership by September and changed its name to
Society of Chinese Artists.

Thus the Shanghai alumni formed SOCA’s core. Tchang Ju-ch’i, Cai
Zhuzhen, Chen Chong Swee,3 Chen Pu Chie and Lee Kueh Sei were
graduates of Shanghai Art Academy, Shu Chun Lien of Xinhua Academy,
and Zhang Bohe of Shanghai University. Although it has yet to be
established if their periods of schooling coincided, we may infer that their
common Shanghai experience fostered a nucleus of shared interest that
brought them together while in Singapore. Here, they put their connection
to use, forming the art society to organise exhibitions and promote their art.

The society grew year by year, and by 1940 it was 40-strong. Four of its
members died during World War II, but SOCA bounced back after the war,
with 65 registered members in 1948.

#### **Same Path, Different Destinies**

Of the SOCA artists who were active in the prewar as well as preindependence
art scene, a handful are well documented and have been
canonised as pioneers of a unique Singapore-Malayan style, including Liu
Kang, Chen Chong Swee, Chen Wen-hsi, Cheong Soo Pieng, Lim Hak Tai
and Georgette Chen. This paper aims at filling in the gaps of our knowledge
about the other artists – those who were part of this critical mass setting
the Singapore art scene abuzz, but whose careers would take different turns,
particularly due to the war.

Many founding members would recede into the background, and some even
retreated from the scene. I have written about Tchang Ju-ch’i, Lu Heng and
Chen Pu Chie elsewhere,4 and my research did not yield much information
on Kau Chin Sheng5 and Nai Wen Chie.6 Although this paper does not offer an exhaustive account of the founding members, it reconstructs a fuller
picture of the scene.

**Lee Kueh Sei** (李魁士; c. 1902–71) was born in Jieyang, Chaozhou, and had
close links with the Teochews in Muar, Johor. A graduate of the Shanghai
Academy of Art and National Academy of Art (Hangzhou), Lee was a
favoured student of painter Liu Haisu (刘海粟). Lee was in Malaya possibly
as early as 1928, when he posed for a picture with a young Liu Kang (刘抗)
in Muar.7

Between 1932 and 1937, Lee taught at Chung Hwa in
Muar, and at Tao Nan School, The Chinese High School
and Tuan Mong School in Singapore, as well as the
Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA), mostly on a
part-time basis. By 1938, it seems Lee had left teaching and
started Khai Ming Bookstore (開明書店) with his friend
Lu Heng. Lee was active within the Teochew community
– he was one of the founders of the Kek Yeoh Association
in 1938 – and was also frequently mentioned in the Tao
Nan alumni association Nanlu Xueyouhui (南廬學友會)
and later in 1948 the Jinshi Shuhuashe (金石書畫社), a
society dedicated to classical painting, calligraphy, seal
carving and ancient inscriptions.

Lee painted in the Shanghai School style inherited from
masters such as Ren Bonian and Wu Changshuo and
perpetuated by the vibrant mercantilism of Shanghai
where Lee had his formal art education. Most of Lee’s
extant and published works show a strong preference
for dramatic composition, excellent brushwork and
flamboyant calligraphy – all characteristics cherished by
the Shanghai School (Figure 2). No cartoons or woodcuts
– in vogue in the 1930s – have been found in Lee’s oeuvre.
